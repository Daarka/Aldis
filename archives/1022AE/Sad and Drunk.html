Hours of tossing and turning on his bedsheets, he finally gave up the attempt and tossed the sheets aside, swinging his bare feet to the floor and reaching for a dove gray and pale blue embroidered robe to wrap around his bare torso and make his way out of his bedroom and into the kitchen.

Straight for the liquor cabinet, he grabbed for a bottle of Frangelico and a chilled crystal glass, adding a couple of ice cubes before taking both the bottle and the glass to the little breakfast nook, curling up on the cushions and drawing up his legs as he gazed out the three corner windows to the starry night sky. He filled the glass and set the bottle aside on the ledge, sipping and focusing on the nutty flavors of the liqueur, the hints of vanilla, chocolate, and coffee a weak distraction from his thoughts.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Arseni was not a morning person, and by extension, not a woken-up-in-the-middle-of-the-night person. His coarse mohawk was out of shape and rather flattened, his eyes squinty and his tail just barely keeping from dragging on the floor as he shuffled in like a lost child, bundled up in a blanket he had taken from his bed. It wasn&#39;t <em>that</em> cold within the well-insulated home, but it was still wintertime, and something Nikotiemus would be keenly aware of by now was how sensitive the little idiot was to cooler temperatures. 

Following the soft shuffling sound that would creep into the corners of Nikotiemus&#39; vision to herald the shitkid&#39;s approach, there was a groggy grumble of, &quot;You look like shit.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Nikotiemus wasn&#39;t exactly an alcoholic. Not really someone who normally woke up in the middle of the night just to drink. &quot;... Nightmares?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As he let the drink settle into his system, he was silent for a few moments. Then, his voice still groggy, but unusually soft, &quot;It doesn&#39;t really get better. But you can get shitfaced until you black out, and that&#39;s pretty much sleep.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Because Nikotiemus had killed his mother. Granted, under the effects of a mind-control spell. But they had been talking about Arseni&#39;s father.

And Nikotiemus had only been innocently seeking clarification; it was clear this was a point Arseni was willing to use extreme violence to defend himself over, that hair trigger alarmingly sensitive to being touched in any way whatsoever. Even after snapping, his eyes had locked challengingly onto Niko&#39;s gaze, as if daring him to create a counterargument.

When his outburst was met with no opposition, his bristling slowly bled away again. And then... minutes ticked by in silence. Minutes where Arseni quietly wrestled with not liking the feeling in his gut from making Niko recoil like he had. Minutes where he tried to figure out how to do better, how to give a better response.

Once again, it wasn&#39;t until it seemed he would no longer be replying that Arseni finally spoke up. 

&quot;... My mom wasn&#39;t born deaf,&quot; he mumbled faintly into the miserable silence. &quot;I... didn&#39;t know you could just be born deaf for most of my life.

Nikotiemus&#39; unspoken words grasped onto that deeply buried shame and all the self loathing that came with it, and yanked it out like pulling a serrated barb directly out from his heart. Out from that place where it was buried and suppressed as low as he could have possibly shoved it, and up through every inch of that chitinous layering that had built up around it, until it had been fully extracted in one nauseatingly painful jolt that left him feeling sore and raw and exposed. 

But with a bit of a weight no longer pinning his heart down, that he couldn&#39;t ever remember having been free of before.

He rapidly began to lose his battle to maintain composure. The bottle slipped from his fingers, landing somewhere on the floor. Probably making a mess. Like a wounded animal that had just been violently blinded, his thick claws groped out to find indiscriminate purchase anywhere they would land on Nikotiemus&#39; body, dragging himself closer to the changeling as the floodgates opened--at least, as much as their stiff and rusty hinges would allow. Tears poured from eyes they were not native to, and choked sobs of a deep and neglected agony forced their way out of a chest that couldn&#39;t control them.

Yeah,&quot; he replied distractedly, squinting and blinking as the washcloth was removed. It took him another few seconds, before he slowly stirred to oblige Niko, getting his dense twink ass up off him so the changeling could actually get up himself. He wobbled out of the tub as gracelessly as he had entered it, immediately beginning to reflexively bristle slightly at the chill of the open air on his wet skin as he looked around for a towel, his eyes bleary and puffy.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He just held it for a few seconds in one hand, fingers subtly making the motions of his prestidigitation cantrip, and when he wrapped it around Arseni, it was blessedly warm.

He loved that fucking cantrip. Couldn&#39;t imagine living without it.

Doing the same to a second towel, he wiped himself off and then wrapped himself up in it, motioning his chin toward the door to head for the bedroom, inviting Arseni into his own without hesitation.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Still a bit damp, Arseni didn&#39;t really think twice about promptly crawling onto the nice bed, not even losing the towel (it was warm, he wanted it to stay) as he helped himself directly beneath all of the bed sheets and comforters and blankets and whatever else was there.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He yawned drowsily in Arseni&#39;s ear, and after a lazy nuzzle into his nape, found himself quickly falling asleep.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
