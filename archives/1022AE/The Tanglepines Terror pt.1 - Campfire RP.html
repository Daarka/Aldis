The hound brought the log of wood over to Cha Cha and dropped it down in front of him, backing up a couple of paces and giving a little dance with his front paws, his floppy orange ears perked forward like he was expecting Cha Cha to throw it for him.

Smart enough to determine that, of the group, Cha Cha was the largest and most likely to be able to throw it for him. Or maybe he was remembering the tussle with the downed tree in the road and thought a game of tug of war was in store.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As conversation turned towards blood hunters—directed at Kaleva—she piped up from where she had been helping him set up their portion of the camp. 

“Blood hunters aren’t evil or anything… those two aren’t what they’re supposed to be. Extremely exceptional case,” she murmured, her voice small but firm.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The one I&#39;m part of, we kind of take the stance of fighting fire with fire. We become monsters to defeat monsters. But there&#39;s a process, a ritual we have to undertake. Because lycanthropy is a curse, and without the process of the Taming, it would take you over, like it did them. Make you more violent, more prone to acts you&#39;d never normally find yourself condoning.&quot;

Kaleva made a vague gesture back down the road they&#39;d come from. &quot;That&#39;s why what I saw today was so disturbing. That shouldn&#39;t have happened. They shouldn&#39;t have been like that.

He gestured slightly with his head toward Skena. &quot;It helps to have a personal compass. I know Skena would tell me if she thought something was wrong, if I was giving it too much free reign.

But other than a bit of dog jokes, sure. It was very serious business.

Skena, however, had the good sense to not bring this up aloud and make it sound problematic--when she did truly believe it wasn&#39;t. 

&quot;He&#39;s never lost control before,&quot; she said in agreement. &quot;Never come close. He&#39;s very careful.&quot;

She was quiet a moment as she thought, before glancing over to Kaleva, her voice softening to address him a bit more singularly. &quot;... Since we&#39;re about to sleep anyways...

He murmured gradually, &quot;They&#39;ll be more active tomorrow. If there are other werewolves around. They&#39;ll be resistant to anything that will slice, stab, or bludgeon. Silvered weapons or magical attacks will affect them normally. If you get bitten by one, you&#39;ll want to get in contact with someone who can cast a remove curse spell. Or - if you have that ability, cast it on a werewolf in battle. If they&#39;re natural-born, it won&#39;t do anything, but if they were bitten and changed, it&#39;ll remove the curse.&quot;

To finally answer Skena&#39;s suggestion, he murmured, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t hurt if there&#39;s anything He can caution us about regarding what we might run into. But I&#39;d rather look for answers ourselves regarding what&#39;s going on with those blood hunters... Make the effort ourselves before asking Him for help, you know?&quot;

He knew Anubis cared for him, but it was too deeply engrained in him to not burden others with his problems.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;... No, I... I should really learn how to do something like that.

But I&#39;m... not really educated on how to just make them more vulnerable yet.&quot;

Looking back down at what she was doing, she pulled a small bundle out of her bag, a stiff shape wrapped entirely in linen. Anyone who had even a passing understanding of Cusaian culture would most likely find it very mummy-like. As it was pulled free, it was partially followed a moment later by a small head poking up out of the bag, with large green eyes squinting out at those around the campsite rather judgmentally. 

&quot;If we&#39;re lucky, there aren&#39;t more lycans ahead of us. Lycans and blood hunters and shifters even--they&#39;ve all existed for ages. No matter how old Dr. Stein is, I don&#39;t think he created them.

&quot;... <em>Healing</em> magic is necromancy. All necromancy is, is the manipulation of lifeforce. It&#39;s...

She shook her head a little. &quot;But I&#39;m. I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m... I&#39;m not... I-I don&#39;t hurt people. Or nature. My relationship with my god is one of the most important things in my life. If not <em>the</em> most important. The core of His teachings are in the natural order. The natural cycle of life and death. He is the entity who shepherds souls from this life to the next. If I were to reach across the veil and <em>take</em> a soul away from the path He is guiding it down, drag it <em>out</em> of that cycle... it would go <em>directly</em> against the very heart of His will. And... if I did things like that, I don&#39;t think He&#39;d continue to grant me magic.&quot; She rubbed her arm a little, having dropped her gaze.

&quot;... You have no reason to believe I&#39;m not... I guess just... bold-faced lying, but... I guess... that&#39;s... that&#39;s the root of the matter. Even if you... don&#39;t believe it right now.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He could respect that.

Still, he knew it was hard for Skena to be put in the position to defend herself and her magic. He knew her history, too, and the emotional scars she carried from it.

Atreyu tilted his head, releasing the strings from Gummy&#39;s gift, seeming to think about it. He then said, articulately and decisively, &quot;<em>Woof.</em>&quot;

&quot;Fish it is,&quot; Kaleva said with a nod, pulling an entire dried salmon from one of the saddlebags and passing it to the hound, who propped it between his paws and started chewing on it.

Returning to his own, he passed Skena&#39;s rations to her, and pulled out his own. Simple fare for him, smoked meat, flatbread, and cheese.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was like she could read his mind or something.

Snatching him up before he could disappear into some hole, she plopped him into her lap with the practiced touch of someone who was well versed in removing things from his mouth, and she began the process of prying the pendant out from the back of his throat. There were more dry, rattling protests from the creature, but Skena did not get slapped in the process as Atreyu had, nor were his noises so viciously feral. More just low grumbles. When the pendant finally came free, she held it to her chest, looking down at the minion pointedly. 

“Thank you. You’ve done your job. Now I’m going to handle this from here, okay? Okay.”

Gummy seemed to deflate into a slouch from there, less fixated on the pendant and more reverting to a judgmental sack of potatoes on her lap, laying in a manner that was probably only comfortable to ferrets. Once he was settled again, Skena reached out to hand the pendant back to Kaskra with a small, apologetic smile.

The “rations” Kaleva set out for her, meanwhile, turned out to just be a single chocolate chip cookie.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
