So, once his schedule and body had aligned decently enough for him to make a trip, he packed up some goodies and headed off for the cave that housed Valkyn&#39;s prison.

Traveling as a prey animal with a lame leg was asking for trouble, so he took on the form of an ash-gray wolf, using his good hind leg as a pogo stick and making ample use of the wolf&#39;s endurance to travel the many miles between Fielbarry and his destination.

Having learned his lesson the first time, when he got to the cave and descended into it, he retook his usual form just as he reached the part where it opened up into the cavernous space. &quot;Valkyn?&quot; he called out peering through the darkness. &quot;Do you mind a visit?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But as his eyes adjusted to the darkness, there was a tiny gleam of something with a shinier surface briefly catching what little light there was, followed by a slow movement of something large. It was hard to identify what Hiraeth was looking at, as it bore no resemblance to any recognizable creature. But as it slowly crawled down from the wall it had been lurking on like a massive spider, the gnarled and hellish anatomy became more easy to discern; a warped and monstrous aberration with long, narrow limbs--too many of them--hunched forward and with a head whose skull seemed split down the middle like one giant pair of mandibles. It was hard to tell where the eyes were on this creature, if it had any, but it seemed to be boring a hole in Hiraeth with its gaze all the same, as it took a few slow steps towards him with a posture that wasn&#39;t entirely clear whether or not it was stalking.

He could almost be forgiven for wondering if this unrecognizable entity <em>was</em> the drow he had met, had it not been for the faint rustle of a chain that came to his ear as the abomination moved.</span></div><div class="chatlog__attachment chatlog__attachment--hidden" onclick=showSpoiler(event,this)><div class=chatlog__attachment-spoiler-caption>SPOILER</div><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1005327225446473748/1005331602747965541/SPOILER_unknown.png?ex=65583d84&amp;is=6545c884&amp;hm=f3e6e5d598620fdee38ee7fe118267adc105e73ed355646914132c5877d15a6b&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1005327225446473748/1005331602747965541/SPOILER_unknown.png?ex=65583d84&amp;is=6545c884&amp;hm=f3e6e5d598620fdee38ee7fe118267adc105e73ed355646914132c5877d15a6b&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: SPOILER_unknown.png (91.38 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

He had voiced his question out of range of the end of that chain, but as he gazed up at the creature, he limped his way forward, deliberately stepping within reach. His raspberry red eyes were half-lidded peacefully, a small smile upon his lips, staff in one hand and a messenger bag slung across his shoulder and hanging at his side.

He had not lit up his tail, either, aware of how painful it was to the drow&#39;s eyes.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And then, finally, the creature&#39;s shape began to change, the monstrous anatomy condensing inwards and then seeming to slough off in streaks of black, until the more familiar visage of the drow stood in its place.

He was still dressed only in a pair of ratty trousers, his eyepatch having been dislodged when he changed forms, and so leaving the void where his right eye should have been exposed, with that black ichor beginning to ooze from the socket as he stared down at the tiefling with the eye that remained.

It was... hard to read his expression. It seemed equally likely he was annoyed by this appearance as he was pleasantly surprised. His gaze raked over Hiraeth, his bag--the lack of flame on his tail--before pinning back to his face.

&quot;... I did not give you my name,&quot; he rumbled lowly.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He unhurriedly turned then, moving back deeper into the cave, stooping briefly to retrieve a strip of leather from the ground as he walked. He hadn&#39;t exactly said anything decisive on the matter, but it was at least the body language of someone inviting someone else into their home.

Being able to see what you were foraging was kind of important, especially when you loved mushrooms as much as Hiraeth did.

The copper teapot had been a lucky trade. It didn&#39;t quite match the carved wooden cups, but he liked them anyway.

And four hundred years of solitary confinement did things to the mind. He hadn&#39;t quite been expecting the sudden surge of <em>anxiety</em>, of all things, at the prospect of leaving this cave. If he stopped to think about it too long, he might decide against it entirely.

His movements were slow, but did not falter or hesitate, as he pushed himself to his feet to move down the stream a few strides, slowly sitting down again. His expression was blank, rather like Hiraeth had hit him over the head with a brick.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;You might want to avert your eyes, or cover them. It&#39;s going to get very bright,&quot; Hiraeth warned, and began working his magic. The faint orange glow in his raspberry eyes brightened like a pair of burning coals, and in his cupped hand he produced a flame that wrapped around the link of metal and began to heat it. It burned bright and hot in his palm, lighting the area all around them, and as the minutes stretched on, the metal began to glow orange.

Once it burned hot enough, he raised the rock high over his head and brought it down as hard as he could, hitting the chains with a sharp clang and sending sparks flying up. Again he hit it, then again, and then hissed, &quot;Okay, dunk it into the water!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The heat was unpleasant, but he didn’t look like a man who whimped out at a bit of pain.

He gave the metal a few seconds to cool down, and gestured again. &quot;Okay, bring it back out. Stretch it taut.&quot; 

Again, heat was applied, and again he struck at it with the stone a few times, and again it was soaked in the water, and any damage Valkyn accrued during the process was soothed by that transparent rabbit.

Sweat from the heat and exertion had Hiraeth&#39;s hair clinging to his face and neck, and it seemed to take ages before finally the rock struck through the weakened and warped metal. Hiraeth used the stone to wiggle into the link and widen the gap so it could be slid out of the manacle, and then he sat back with a heavy exhale, the fire in his palm flickering out as he tossed the rest of the chain away.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Hiraeth had been handling the chain directly long enough now to appreciate just how heavy it was, especially when the weight of its full length was pulled upon.

He said nothing for a while as Hiraeth recovered. He wasn&#39;t sure <em>what</em> to say. As the adrenaline settled back to calm quiet, his previously foreign anxiety buzzed erratically, not sure how it felt about this abrupt and enormous change after so, <em>so</em> long of nothing changing at all. And without a guarantee that this was even a <em>good</em> change.

By the time his gaze landed back on Hiraeth, he still hadn&#39;t figured out what to say, the look on his face just... utterly blank.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Take your time,&quot; Hiraeth breathed, pushing himself to his feet unsteadily. That transparent, ethereal rabbit gently bounced its way away from Valkyn and over to Hiraeth, touching its nose to the tip of his boot and sending the last of its healing energy up to the cuts on his palm from the edge of the rock digging into his hand.

And then he blinked. And blinked again. And his vision seemed to come into focus a bit more, settling on the scarf that had been discarded. After a pause, he slowly leaned forward, reaching out to close his fingers around the fabric and drawing it back towards himself. His face still looked blank, but though his movements were almost uncomfortably slow, there was something soothing about just... doing something. 

Not foreseeing anything wrong with it, he carefully bundled the scarf all together, and then dunked it into the water. He gave it a slow squeeze to ensure the water soaked into all of the fabric, before pulling it up again, and squeezing once more to wring most of the water back out. Then, just as slowly, he handed it back towards Hiraeth.

&quot;... You will cool down faster.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He stayed there, leaning slightly against the rock wall, and suddenly finding himself drowning in an anxiety he hadn&#39;t predicted would ever be there. He... didn&#39;t <em>want</em> to leave. The idea of doing so was more than overwhelming. This cave wasn&#39;t much, and in truth, it had been fairly miserable, as was the intention. But four centuries made it more familiar to him than the world outside, having now spent more of his life inside this cave than out. And much of those centuries had been endured with the expectation that there was no feasible return to society; that this is where he would agelessly exist for an indefinite period of time, before either beast or pompous hero or natural disaster snuffed him out. 

It wasn&#39;t a matter of preference or hope or revitalized ambition. It was a matter of reality. This cave was his reality. Anything else was another planet, another plane of existence entirely. 

It was a great deal to process and try to not lose himself to. He would continue to sit, staring off into space, for hours. And then more hours. The daylight had faded from the faint reflections of it at the cave&#39;s entrance, and he hadn&#39;t moved an inch.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He took care of business a ways away from the cave, then returned to the mouth of it, looking up at the blanket of stars splashed across the sky. Insects filled the air with a faint hum of noise, accompanied by other animals sounds, frogs and owls, and the far-off scream of a fox.

It was a perfect night for Valkyn to take his first steps from his cave. If he could convince him.

He returned to find Valkyn right where he&#39;d left him, and went over to stand before him and offer his hand in quiet invitation.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was easier to just move without thinking about it. If he thought about it, he would never move again.

Slowly, he pushed himself back to his feet, eyeing Hiraeth&#39;s hand for a long moment more, before--just as slowly--placing his own within it. His claws were thick like talons, something that was not at all a feature of a typical drow, with his hands a bit rough from the ways he&#39;d had to provide for himself.

His demeanor remained shut off, but the tension was clear in his posture.

Every glimpse of a creature in the shadows would draw his full attention, though his body barely moved.

Even the topography of the surrounding area had changed notably. He barely remembered how it had looked when he was brought here first, but it was unrecognizable all the same.

He gave his hand another squeeze, then gently drew his hand away from it, stepping forward to walk in around the trees. His features were serene and calm, completely in his element in that place. As though drawn to him, fireflies began to blink around him, little specks of light that faded in and out as they drifted about and landed on his antler-like horns and in the long, wispy strands of his hair.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Finally, without responding verbally, his flesh seemed to just--start sloughing off of himself, sliding over slick black slime. His shape warped under the mess, rapidly changing until he stood on four legs, looking... well, not like a known creature. 

Just a little smaller than a horse, his new form was sleek and wiry, built like some... feline-canine-alligator abomination. His tail was excessively long and thin like a whip, and at its end were claws on three separate digits. 

A keen eye would note that sure enough, the iron shackle was still present on his left hind leg. It looked a bit snug, but this creature&#39;s limbs were narrow enough to just barely allow it.

There was a pause as Valkyn settled into his new anatomy, raptor-like talons flexing hesitantly in the soil, before that tail swooped down as an afterthought, finger-like digits at its end deftly picking up the eyepatch that had dislodged from his new anatomy.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1006071867636994098 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1006071867636994098><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, August 7, 2022 10:30 PM">10:30 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__attachment chatlog__attachment--hidden" onclick=showSpoiler(event,this)><div class=chatlog__attachment-spoiler-caption>SPOILER</div><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1005327225446473748/1006071866747781130/SPOILER_unknown.png?ex=655aeef0&amp;is=654879f0&amp;hm=3698faaeb87befdddd430ea343b3f4013bbedf24b95895ed67ab1eac9e6b2181&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1005327225446473748/1006071866747781130/SPOILER_unknown.png?ex=655aeef0&amp;is=654879f0&amp;hm=3698faaeb87befdddd430ea343b3f4013bbedf24b95895ed67ab1eac9e6b2181&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: SPOILER_unknown.png (340.04 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1006071952940728322 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1006071952940728322><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, August 7, 2022 10:30 PM">10:30 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__attachment chatlog__attachment--hidden" onclick=showSpoiler(event,this)><div class=chatlog__attachment-spoiler-caption>SPOILER</div><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1005327225446473748/1006071951598559323/SPOILER_unknown.png?ex=655aef05&amp;is=65487a05&amp;hm=71abebab5e829a0762161f1731cd0cfe25a1056704a9a4ece8ad16d48e42f032&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1005327225446473748/1006071951598559323/SPOILER_unknown.png?ex=655aef05&amp;is=65487a05&amp;hm=71abebab5e829a0762161f1731cd0cfe25a1056704a9a4ece8ad16d48e42f032&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: SPOILER_unknown.png (5.47 MB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

It was similarly hard to discern emotion from the aberrant creature, but he <em>did</em> seem quite tense, hesitating as Hiraeth welcomed him inside. The alien head swung to regard the forest around them with a touch of something paranoid, the space where the right eye should have been now freely flowing black ichor that had run uninhibited as they traveled. 

Finally, the muscles rippled, and then sloughed off in a grotesque display, the shape warping back to that of the drow. The ichor had oozed halfway down his neck by then, making him look more alarming than usual--and as he returned to a humanoid shape, it was much clearer that he <em>was</em> panting, notably more than Hiraeth. 

Still looking uncomfortable with his surroundings, he wordlessly ducked inside after another tense moment of apparent indecision, not looking relieved once he entered the home, but looking around warily to take inventory of the newest change of scenery.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There were bundles of dried herbs hanging from the ceiling in the kitchen, jars of dried mushrooms, preserves, and the like.

The water that spouted out made him jump ever so slightly at first, but once he understood what was happening, he leaned forward and ran his face under the water. 

The puddle that had begun to gather over the drain was immediately clouded with that black, viscous slime, which didn&#39;t seem to want to blend well with the water, and so was swirled about in tendrils within the flow before being sucked into the drain. When Valkyn pulled his head back again, the deeply carved valleys down the side of his face were clean of the ichor--but once the water was no longer running directly over them, little beads of blood began to slowly appear. If there had been any confusion over what happened to his face, that seemed to solve the matter.

A very, very long period of occasional exposure to a substance that was only slightly caustic--but caustic nonetheless.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;These are... not dirty.&quot;

In fairness, Hiraeth had been close enough by now to get a good whiff of him. He smelled earthy, he smelled like the cave he had been in--but he did not reek of body odor. Evidently, he had been doing <em>something</em> to keep himself relatively hygienic. Likewise, the trousers he wore were ratty, moth-eaten, and had holes in a few places along the legs, but were not noticeably soiled. They really deserved to be trashed, but they could have been far more offensive to the senses, at least.

By the standards of civilized folk, they were on the dirty side, though.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Eventually, he managed to pull himself out of it long enough to get clean, giving his eye another rinse to clear away what ichor had welled up since his initial rinse of it, before slowly pulling himself out of the tub again. He found a towel, his movements still unhurried and almost mindless as he carefully unfolded it, running his fingers over it a bit, before using it to blot himself off. When he was sufficiently dry, he unfolded the pants he had been offered, looking over them a moment, before beginning to put them on just as carefully, almost like he was afraid of breaking something. Ultimately, the tunic made its way onto his body as well, the feeling of fresh fabric against his skin comfortable--yet wildly unfamiliar.

Once he was dressed, he walked almost aimlessly back out into the main room, looking around without seeming to be looking for anything in particular.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But the furs in front of the fireplace should be comfortable enough to trance on, or one of the kitchen chairs...&quot;

Hiraeth wasn&#39;t exactly an intimidating or impressive figure on his best days, but gently sprawled on that tiny bed, his silky fine hair in slight disarray around him, one hand curled up by his head and the other across his stomach, he looked oddly vulnerable. And completely trusting in opening his home to this drow he&#39;d met twice, even sleeping around him.

He yawned again, and then murmured, &quot;...You gonna be okay?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;... We will see,&quot; he mumbled after a pause. Fortunately, he was <em>extremely</em> accustomed to not having a bed, so the lack of civilized sleeping arrangements meant nothing to him. After a moment of potentially contemplation, his flesh began to slough again, warping him until he had returned to the unknown creature he had traveled as. 

It was... a bit large for this space. But the creature was narrow and lithe in build, and once he had padded slowly over towards the fireplace, circled twice like an enormous, hellish puppy, and settled down onto his belly, he didn&#39;t take up nearly as much space. That whip-like tail was long enough to curl around himself once, and then curl a second time over his back, the clawed digits at the end tucking neatly against the floor. His muzzle was unnervingly toothy, but the scary anatomy was lessened somewhat by the behavior of him idly sniffing at the furs he was curled atop for a moment, before gingerly lowering his head onto them, tilting his face so the empty void where his right eye should have been was angled upwards, keeping more ichor from spilling out and onto the floor as he rested.

And then he was perfectly, unnaturally still.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Luka had accepted his decline easily, and went about pulling out containers of food. Helping himself to Hiraeth&#39;s kitchen, he took down two plates and set warm, fresh buttermilk biscuits on them, and opened a container of steaming sausages. Though, he paused in the act of dishing those up, and asked after Valkyn, &quot;Oh - excuse me, I forgot to ask. Do you have any food allergies or restrictions?

&quot;Only to clients like yourself who can sometimes be rendered bedridden and don&#39;t always have a means of reaching out,&quot; Luka replied, walking out with a plate, a knife, and a fork for both of them, offering one to Valkyn first. &quot;It never hurts to check in.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Of course not. Are you suffering from the usual, or did you over-exert yourself?&quot;

&quot;The latter.&quot; Hiraeth stiffly eased down onto his front on the bed, resting his chin on his folded arms. &quot;I went on a very long excursion. Animal forms make travel easier, but it still leaves me sore if I overdo it.&quot;

Luka went over to his side, leaning in to glide his palms searchingly over the other tiefling&#39;s shoulders and back. &quot;...Elk form again? You always get this interesting tension and stiffness between your shoulders and down your neck when you&#39;re in that form long enough.&quot;

But the thought came and went without being explored much. And Valkyn had to admit, having homemade food that wasn&#39;t just mushrooms or raw meat... it made him ache a little. Yet despite that, he ate slow, savoring every bite. 

And then he stiffened notably, one ear shifting a fraction as he tilted his face to cast his good eye towards the door with a sudden rise of tension and fiery defensiveness. The shift was explained a moment later, as there was a gentle knock at the door.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I can hardly say no to Valentine,&quot; Hiraeth murmured. &quot;Sorry, Valkyn. There&#39;s a greenhouse just past that door over there if you get overwhelmed and would rather not linger in here.&quot;

&quot;Good morning, Luka--and you as well, Hiraeth. Pardon my butting in.&quot; She gave a small, dismissive wave of her hand, helping herself inside. As usual, her other hand was fixed comfortably around her staff, whose eye was boring a hole into the stranger. &quot;I&#39;m nothing if not over-protective--though I&#39;m very relieved it seems my visit was unnecessary after all.&quot; But she came anyways. Because she had a ravenous curiosity about this aberrant-touched feral man.

Hiraeth lifted his head, having been about to greet Valentine when he saw what Valkyn was looking at, and how he was looking at it.

If it bothered her, though, it was impossible to tell.

&quot;Not to worry,&quot; she hummed easily. &quot;He is more than sufficiently contained. I imagine it&#39;s quite the unpleasant arrival, though. My apologies for that.&quot; She even gave the drow a lighthearted wink. &quot;Try to shrug it off, if you can. It gratifies him too much to think he has an effect on the rest of the world anymore.&quot;

Valkyn said nothing, though he gave a brief glance towards Hiraeth as the tiefling hobbled over, a fleeting flicker of muted surprise there before the absolute <em>stench</em> of concentrated aberration seized his full attention again. 

Stiffly, he pushed himself to his feet, his movements slow and untrusting. But instead of escaping to the greenhouse indicated, or even moving forward to confront the strangers and the dark passenger they carried, he was still a moment, and then reached out to knot his fingers in Hiraeth&#39;s shirt, using it as if scruffing a small animal, so he could forcibly pull him back towards his bed while still affording him support in the process, so as not to end up just pushing him over. Once there, he tore his gaze away from Valentine long enough to level a hard stare at Hiraeth, pushing him firmly--though not roughly--back where he had been laying.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Luka settled back down beside the bed, not at all afraid to be in such close proximity to Valkyn with Valentine so close, and began locating pressure points to try to calm the wild spasming that has started up in Hiraeth&#39;s mangled leg.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Oh, nothing&#39;s going on,&quot; she dismissed easily. &quot;Not any more than usual, anyways.&quot; Tilting her head thoughtfully, she cast her friendly smile towards Hiraeth.

&quot;I have an interest in the aberrant because I have deep ties with things of such a nature. Your new friend appears to be more aware of such things than the average folk. But there is nothing afoot, no danger posed to anyone. I would not bring anything questionable into your home, dear.&quot; She exhaled an amused huff. 

&quot;Those who are able to pick up on the things I carry tend to find them off-putting at first, because of how unusual it is to encounter things like that whilst simply mingling around town. But despite the abnormality and understandable initial concern, there is no threat. There never has been, and these things are alongside me every single day, wherever I go.

&quot;He&#39;s, ah... Quite thoroughly stripped of any capacity to do any harm.&quot; And, strangely, Luka sounded oddly <em>guilty</em> about it.

But she knew Valkyn was listening and understood common. It was her carefree way of setting a <em>firm</em> boundary, especially if Luka was going to be around Hiraeth--and by extension, Valkyn--in her absence.

Valkyn still was not quite looking at her, but wordlessly side-eyeing the staff, not exactly relaxed, but managing his discomfort well enough.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Valentine wasn&#39;t terribly concerned about him knowing more than he had previously, but given the choice, she would have not disclosed any of it. 

Valkyn, of course, was left in the dark for most of this. He had once been very educated, enough to have been able to extremely crudely follow some of the infernal discussion--but his very simple understanding of some languages he was not fluent in had bled out of him in the length of his isolation. He only barely hung on to common as it was.

Hiraeth finally lifted his head from his arms, having been indeed listening in silently.

&quot;I believe that would be entirely the fault of my presence throwing a wrench in the gears,&quot; Val hummed, not sounding like she was being particularly hard on herself. &quot;I will stop distracting him from tending to you now, though.&quot; Her head turned a fraction towards the drow, that sunshine right back on her features. 

&quot;Some time ago, Hiraeth mentioned having encountered a strange drow in some underground cave, chained in place there.

I can&#39;t imagine too many circumstances where being chained in a cave would be pleasant or preferable to the alternative, so I hope you are enjoying the changes,&quot; she said warmly.

Valkyn straightened up a tiny bit more as he was addressed directly, his hard stare not changing.

The brief and superficial irritation that had been in his expression was gone, replaced with a calm expressionlessness as he looked over the various plants, studying each one unhurriedly. 

After a long pause, he reached out, carefully plucking a berry from one bush with a manner of delicacy that seemed out of place on his gnarled talons. Straightening up again, he rolled it between his fingers a little, before lifting it to tuck it past his lips.

The herbs, berries, and vegetables were gathered in wicker baskets to be taken in, the herbs bundled and hung to dry, the berries and vegetables washed in water from the well to be preserved or given to his friends fresh.

It was quiet work. Work that required no words to be spoken, or loud noises to be made. As though Hiraeth understood that Valkyn could probably use some quiet time after the excitement of the last twenty-four hours.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He seemed to find something soothing in such work—but he’d had very little else to do for pseudo recreation than tend to his own manner of garden for centuries. Most of these plants were nothing like what had grown in the cave (he seemed the most familiar with the mushrooms, of course), and some of Hiraeth’s tools or techniques were unfamiliar, between the long years of technology advancing without Valkyn and the cultural differences between how things were done on Aedrenor versus Xhorhas.

By the time the sun was starting to set again, they&#39;d gotten a lot done. Three baskets sat near the door ready to go out the next day. One for Cass and Nils, one for Skena and Kaleva, and one for the Piotovich family, each basket filled with herbs, fresh veggies and berries, and a couple jars of jams and pickles.

&quot;My friends and I have an exchange system,&quot; he explained as he finally settled down for the evening, sitting down on the pile of furs in front of the fireplace and setting a few logs in place and a pile of shredded birch bark as kindling. &quot;We each have our own niche and we support each other with gifts of goods like these. From Skena and Kaleva, I get fresh honey and meat from their kills, sometimes pelts. From Cassiana and Nils, I get tea blends, milk, cheese, and yogurt.

&quot;Good evening, Hiraeth. I apologize for intruding. May I come in?&quot;

The normally unflappable tiefling tensed and drew in a long breath through his nose, gaze flicking sharply to the hammer and the armor she wore. His lips pressed into a thin line and he narrowed his eyes, flame wooshing to life at the tip of his tail.

He remained firmly blocking the doorway, his fingers tight around the frame. &quot;Altaira,&quot; he greeted lowly. &quot;I&#39;m not inclined to welcome you into my home, given you have come here clearly in preparation for a fight.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There was a grimness to his features, a stiff set to his shoulders. He knew he would not win a fight against her. He knew that if she decided to barge into his home, he would not be able to stop her.

But he would not just let it happen, either. Personal consequences be damned. He&#39;d made his choice and accepted the consequences, whatever they turned out to be.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Instead, after a silent pause, he appeared at Hiraeth&#39;s shoulder, carrying his abandoned staff--which was firmly pushed into his grasp. With the same gentle firmness, he maneuvered around him to exit the home, briefly holding his torso so he wouldn&#39;t be toppled in the process. 

He held himself with as much dignity as he reasonably could in the face of what, to him, personified his failures. His chin was not raised defiantly at the woman who stood eye to eye with him, but neither was his head ducked shamefully. They seemed to digest the sight of each other for a few long, tense seconds of silence, neither showing much emotion other than some manner of grim resolve.

When Altaira finally broke the silence, she spoke in fluent undercommon, her apparent greeting succinct and flat. Valkyn replied in kind--and even without being able to understand him, Hiraeth would be able to immediately tell that the stilted and imperfect ways he had spoken towards him was exclusively due to common not being his mother tongue. Speaking his own language, he sounded equally articulate and very nearly regal as his apparent sister. 

The exchange went back and forth, stretched slow by that careful tension wired through either drow. Altaira&#39;s words remained stony and cold, at times even seeming like she was probably being somewhat condescending. Or, perhaps, speaking down to Valkyn in a very similar way as he had spoken down to Hiraeth. Maybe the smidge of arrogance ran in the family.

Valkyn&#39;s voice remained low and measured, easily halting if Altaira interrupted him. Wary and guarded, tense and suspicious, but carrying enough shame at its core to remain humble in his demeanor, not seeming to speak anything challengingly. 

They did not talk very long. Only a minute or two, before silence stretched between them again. After staring him down wordlessly a moment, Altaira turned her unsettling gaze back towards Hiraeth, speaking in common once more with a degree of polite courtesy that had not been present with her brother. 

&quot;I trust you remember our prior conversation, Hiraeth?&quot; She asked cordially.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She shifted her grip to pick up her weapon--not to wield it, but simply to grip the haft where it could be properly carried. With another brief nod towards Hiraeth, she murmured, &quot;Do enjoy your evening,&quot; before simply turning to leave.

Valkyn stayed where he stood, clearly still strung tight with tension as he watched her go. When she was finally out of sight, he sighed long and deep, trying to rid himself of the lingering anxiety. 

Turning back towards the door, he once more carefully maneuvered around Hiraeth to return inside.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He still had a sort of suspicion to his demeanor, but at least the oncoming sensations seemed pleasant. Calm. Peaceful. Peaceful was nice.

Even outside the context of his isolation, cannabis was new to him. He hadn&#39;t ever been much of a drinker, either--though Xhorhasian wine was uniquely noteworthy.

As Hiraeth relaxed on the floor, Valkyn found himself zoning out where he sat, accustomed enough to trancing whilst seated upright that sitting thusly was decently comfortable. And he would remain there for quite some time. Hiraeth would have most likely dozed off by the time Valkyn finally gave in to the nagging hunger that had arisen, and silently rose to his feet to uncertainly poke around the kitchen. Even rummaging about, he was unusually quiet, ultimately finding some bread that he opted to eat plain. 

After all, by his standards, baked bread was a rare luxury. 

Whether or not Hiraeth had actually found sleep, more time would pass in silence, before something large and rigid came to rest over his midsection. If he opened his eyes, Hiraeth would find the aberration Valkyn had travelled as, now lying with his body curled around where the tiefling lay, and his excessively toothy maw using his torso as a pillow, his good eye turned towards his unwitting pillow&#39;s face. It was the same foggy, pale lavender color as his eyes were normally, though in this form, the eye was that same color all over, like a dull pearl held in his socket. And that eye was lazily lidded, clearly thoroughly high, even if the sudden behavior of a pet mastiff did not make that evident.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It wasn&#39;t until Valkyn had transformed and decided he&#39;d make a good pillow that Hiraeth giggled, lifting his hands to explore the face of the creature, tracing his brow and cheeks and even touching the sharp teeth. &quot;You&#39;re so high right now,&quot; he said with sleepy giddiness. &quot;Good thing you didn&#39;t have more than the one hit.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Or perhaps the cannabis just gradually sapped his energy to continue.

Hiraeth was probably asleep by the time Valkyn finally returned to his drow form, perhaps only then remembering that he could, or arguably should do so. His cleanup job on his face wasn&#39;t perfect, but he was a bit too out of it to go clean up properly, at least managing to remember to relocate and don his eyepatch to avoid a perpetuation of the mess. 

When all that was accomplished (taking about twice as long as it should have), his attention turned back towards Hiraeth, vaguely surprised to see he had lost his shirt. Why did he take his shirt off? It wasn&#39;t particularly warm enough to warrant that. That was stupid of him. He wasn&#39;t going to survive the winter.

He sat there, staring blankly at the tiefling for a while. Without a whole lot of thought put into it, he moved closer and settled down directly next to him, still staring at him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Valkyn got new clothes that fit a lot better than Hiraeth&#39;s, his own toiletries, and several books from Fielbarry&#39;s library having to do with magical advancements and studies over the last few centuries, all in undercommon. They got their hole dug to dispose of anything ichor-tainted, and Hiraeth grew a natural-looking door over the top that blended in well with the land around it. The baskets of goodies were delivered to their respective people and exchanged for more goods in return.

Mid-morning on the fourth day of Valkyn&#39;s newfound freedom, it was raining, but that didn&#39;t deter Jaska from stopping by. Now completely rested and recovered from his adventure with Arseni, he stepped up to the door and knocked sharply.

Hiraeth looked up from the kitchen where he was cutting up strawberries for preserves, reaching for a towel to wipe his red-stained hands. &quot;One moment,&quot; he called out, reaching for his staff to limp his way to the door and open it. &quot;Ah, good morning. Please come in. Do you need a towel?&quot;

Jaska waved him off absently as he stepped into the house. &quot;It&#39;s just water. I came to see this new guest of yours.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Hard to say where the red eye came from, as the other was the same solid butter yellow as his siblings, and his horns had a different shape. But the slight gradient to his hair and the color of his skin were a close enough match to tie him to them.

He folded his hands behind his back and observed Valkyn for a moment before prompting pointedly, &quot;I&#39;d like to have a conversation with you. Can you speak in that form?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Releasing his hand, she looked over the ground a moment, before stooping to fix her fingers in some of the ground--pulling it back to reveal a very well camouflaged hatch. Inside was a simple hole, about a foot wide and two feet deep, though it was hard to tell if anything was in it.

Then something did levitate out of it while Axa held the cover open. It was a strip of fabric stained in something goopy and jet black--and at the center of each stain, the substance appeared to have created a small hole through the material.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She was silent for a while, clearly struggling to sort out how to elaborate. When she finally spoke again, it was with a tiny shake of her head. 

&quot;... It&#39;s... zero,&quot; seemed the best she could figure out.

Val listened thoughtfully. &quot;... Axa, dear, do you mind if I borrow your vision again? Like we did when you watched Achoris take Luka on a date? That way I can see what you see. Maybe I can help you describe it.&quot;

Axa still hadn&#39;t looked up from the ichor, but after a pause, gave a tiny nod.

Carefully, Val moved around her brother, dropping her connection with him, and gently reaching out to place a hand on the side of the girl&#39;s arm. She didn&#39;t let her touch linger once the connection was there, taking a deep breath as she soaked in the slightly overwhelming stimuli of how everything--including their own wild selves--looked through true sight.

But even she didn&#39;t seem to have apt vocabulary for it immediately, her sightless eyes squinting puzzlingly. 

&quot;... I... think I can see why she&#39;s calling it zero. But... I&#39;m not sure how to describe why.&quot; She chewed her lip for a moment. 

&quot;Last time I borrowed her vision, you asked me about seeing Achoris&#39; god. My answer was that, though I knew it sounded strange, it was a bit like seeing a concept, an idea in some ways. Like somehow being able to visually tell that the entity was many places at once, yet also simultaneously keeping an eye on that situation without being fully, entirely present. In... a similarly abstract way, this... this is like seeing a void where something ought to be. But also seeing the substance present there... and yet its very presence is representative of a deep nothingness. I&#39;m not quite sure what to make of it.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

So putting that into my running hypothesis, perhaps this ichor isn&#39;t dissolving the cloth so much as... erasing it. In typical cases where things are corroded or dissolved, the chemical reactions create a product as a result, such as a gas. But if this... zero ichor is just slowly erasing whatever it comes into contact with...&quot;

He stood back for a moment. &quot;The glass might not actually do anything to stop it eating away at what it touches. And the ichor itself doesn&#39;t seem to be lessening or changing with what it removes. It&#39;s not reacting or changing with any of the substances I&#39;ve introduced it to.

&quot;...Well, there&#39;s no safely storing it. And it works too slowly to be used as a weapon. <em>Possibly</em> deadly if ingested, if any of it can be absorbed through the lining of the stomach or intestines, it&#39;d slowly eat a person from the inside.&quot; He thought about that for a moment, then turned to Axa. &quot;Could I have you go out and find a small animal to test this on? A rabbit would work nicely.&quot;

Glancing to Valentine, he shrugged. &quot;Not sure when and were that would be useful if it is a thing. Maybe if I want someone to experience a very slow and prolonged death. Though regular healing might actually sustain them and just make their quality of life miserable... But after testing on the rabbit, I think just putting this back where we found it is the best option. Not like I can&#39;t go back later to gather some.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Not a terrible conclusion. Though I&#39;m still terribly curious what created such a substance. What... entity, or curse, or magical deviations produced it. It doesn&#39;t feel to me like anything I&#39;ve ever encountered before, which is very nearly abnormal. Despite its relation to Valkyn, it doesn’t seem even slightly aberrant to me—which just intrigues me further.&quot; She sighed. 

&quot;But yes, it sounds like its uses might be a bit minimal. Outside of... long-term infiltration. Like spilling some atop a safe, and then coming back in a few days. Or weeks.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But if he doesn&#39;t even know what he&#39;s looking at, that&#39;s where that endeavor ends.&quot; She tipped her head towards the table and the miniature experiments upon it. 

&quot;Such as this substance. While I can tell you several things it is <em>not</em>, even Rhatihl is unfamiliar with what this might be.&quot; A beat. 

&quot;Not that he actually endeavors to help me or answer questions, of course. I&#39;m just attuned enough to his psyche by now, I do well at translating the involuntary recognition he experiences when faced with certain creatures, despite him in no way attempting to voluntarily share his thoughts. Among the many things I have taken from him is his privacy to his own mind.&quot; 

She sighed. &quot;But I digress. It&#39;s fun to lord over him, but my point is mainly just that without an entity such as Rhatihl to grant him insight, I doubt Valkyn has an innate way of identifying things other than what he is most attuned to.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And believe it or not, he and I are cut from the same cloth. It manifests differently, but…” she shrugged.

“I like to smile. Even when I’m terrified. Even when I feel like I’m about to watch my brothers, my only family, be torn apart by something I dragged into our lives. It’s simply how I choose to go through this life. I would have every right to be bitter and broody and aloof and suspicious—all those things that happened to Luka happened to me as well.” A pause. “With the exception of a new sibling growing inside of me. But I saw the same horrors—in my own roundabout way—and heard the same threats. My every thought was consumed with fear that I would lose Luka, and lose the new brother I had only begun to welcome into my life. But I preferred the experience I cultivated for myself by only ever wearing a smile. It kept Luka calm, gave him hope and stability—which meant you had a chance, as well. And arguably more importantly, it kept Rhatihl guessing. I would not have been able to trap him if he thought I was acting out of fear for my brothers. Without fear, I looked to him like a zealot who would voluntarily allow him to manipulate me—and it made him trust me for just one second too long.”

She sighed pleasantly. “Luka does not have a manipulative bone in his body. Certainly not to that scale, at least. But like myself, he chooses to live his life in the way that cultivated the results he prefers. When you are kind to others, they are more likely to be kind to you. When you are selfless, charitable, and empathetic, you are less likely to have enemies and more likely to have allies. And I think, <em>especially</em> after all he’s been through, Luka wants a wholesome life. He wants friends, he wants to have nothing haunting him or seeking his demise. He may not be capable of hardening his exterior as you have as a means of survival—so the next best thing, if you cannot defend well against the world, is to go out of your way to invite as little conflict as possible. Like… a little beetle, who can do nothing to stop a bird from eating it alive, learning to spray pheromones that deter predators and make itself an unattractive meal option. In that way, it is just as much his method of surviving this life as your paranoia is yours.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A fair comparison. Hot peppers evolved to be spicy to deter being eaten. And then people came along and decided they liked eating the spicy and sought them out.

He let out a very put-upon sigh and folded his arms, tilting his head back. &quot;Whatever.

Tucking the scrap of ichor-soaked cloth into the end of the tube, he knelt down beside Axa to pry the rabbit&#39;s mouth open and shove the tube down its throat, depressing the syringe of water into the tube to make sure the scrap of fabric was deposited into its stomach.

&quot;Do let me know if anything starts looking different with the rabbit,&quot; he added, either to Valentine or to Axa, it didn&#39;t matter. &quot;I figure we&#39;ll observe it for a time, and if nothing happens within the hour, I&#39;ll check in on it every hour or so after that and extend the observation windows as necessary.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

If Jaska looked up, he would find the rabbit now laying partially on its side, every muscle in its body tense. It gave a few occasional twitches, strangled gasps for breath sounding wet. By the time the twitching fell still, a slow-moving puddle of black had begun to bloom out from beneath the animal, though there were no immediately visible injuries. And there was a great deal more ichor than had originally gone <em>in</em> to the rabbit. 

Axa watched closely. Then began to fidget a little, momentarily antsy as she tried to figure out how to communicate. Something clicked, and she quickly moved over to Jaska, crawling halfway up his body to pull from his pocket the strange, soul-trapping gem she had made for him, holding it where he could see it. Despite the death occurring so nearby, the gem was still pitch black.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As he used the tongs to lift the rabbit, though, he’d get the answer to one of his questions.

Not only was the animal entirely limp—but as it was lifted off the floor and peeked under, it was immediately apparent that what had been a three-dimensional animal was now more like the shape of an upside down bowl. It’s upward facing exterior looked unmarred, but not only had its body, where it touched the floor, disappeared entirely, but almost all of the internal structures were gone as well. Likely the only reason the entire rabbit hadn’t deteriorated (or just plain vanished) seemed to do with gravity pulling the offending substance away from the highest points of the body. 

There was no smell. No gas. The body parts were simply gone, with only strings and smears of black residue left behind in the cavern of the corpse.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Back at the cozy little cottage, Hiraeth returned from his trip to the city, his messenger bag laden with books and supplies.

As Hiraeth returned, he roused lazily, taking his time stretching like a giant, unsettling dog, before standing fully and shifting back. Returning his eyepatch to its usual place on his head, he shuffled over to where Hiraeth had set things down.

“… Thank you,” he rumbled once more, extending a hand to pick up one of the books and look over it. He muttered something in undercommon under his breath, likely reading off the title on the book. 

“I did not expect so many books in my language to be available,” he noted absentmindedly.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The primordials fought each other, even fought the Luxon, in their elemental chaos. The Luxon saw that when one was destroyed, it was lost to the darkness. So the Luxon tore itself apart, and hid pieces of itself around the planet. These pieces are called... beacons.&quot; A pause as he seemed to doubt his translation for a moment, before he gave a little nod. &quot;Beacons. They allow rebirth.

Not everything. But some things.

His thick claws, having grown in a way that nearly overtook the tips of his fingers and replaced it with something much more chitinous, managed to somehow be thoroughly delicate despite their natural roughness as they tangled loosely in the strands of his hair, gliding over the sensitive skin at the back of his neck. After a few moments of similarly delicate kissing, he seemed to have those ancient memories of experience stirred up again, and his touch gained a bit more deliberate firmness as he began to find some semblance of his stride in the activity. Another moment passed, before his weight shifted forward again, this time with the hand behind Hiraeth&#39;s neck moving where it could more firmly support his weight as the tiefling was gently pushed backwards onto the fur rug, Valkyn&#39;s other hand planted to his side to brace his own weight so he didn&#39;t smother the other man.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He reached up only to remove his glasses, setting them aside so they wouldn&#39;t get knocked askew, the world turning to blurred shapes and colors, with Valkyn&#39;s face being the only thing left in focus.

He seemed to be mindful of Hiraeth&#39;s bad leg, avoiding jostling or putting pressure on it as he settled his weight carefully over the tiefling.

It also... pushed rather far into Hiraeth&#39;s mouth. Not enough to threaten to gag him, but certainly more than tongues were typically able to extend.

If Valkyn was conscious of this abnormality, he didn&#39;t seem to pay it any mind.

With one hand propping up his own body, the other fell to Hiraeth&#39;s hips, claws curling in to unfasten the strap that held his waistband over his tail with a somewhat surprising degree of ease and familiarity, continuing then by hooking his fingers over the waistband to tug his pants towards his thighs.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His eyes gleamed and roamed unapologetically over his torso, sliding his hands up his sides and along his ribs. He wanted to take a nipple into his mouth, but that was a level of maneuverability he wasn&#39;t sure he could pull off with how his horns were situated. He&#39;d have to do the mental gymnastics to figure that out when he wasn&#39;t inebriated. He removed his hands only long enough to wriggle out of his own tunic, dropping it to the side and immediately letting his hands roam over Valkyn again, down around his waist and the lines of his hips.

His own torso bore the scars of a life lived in the wilds, in an unforgiving environment. Most just narrow things, almost invisible against his ash gray skin: the cut of a slipped knife on his hands, or the drag of a sharp thorn or branch or stone. But starting to the left of his navel and dragging down along his hip to disappear into the waistline of his readjusted pants were the deep gouges left behind by a bear&#39;s claws. He&#39;d come very, very close to being disemboweled.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He knew how to stick his dick in something; that primal knowledge was hard to forget. But intimacy, in the social sense, he was far less equipped for. He wordlessly watched Hiraeth pull his shirt off and run his hands over his chest for a moment, before seeming to come to a conclusion on what would make the most sense to him. 

If he didn’t know how to safely proceed, he’d not be at the helm of this expedition. 

Leaning low over the tiefling, he snaked a hand behind his back again, this time to brace him against his front so he could carefully roll over, repositioning to lay on his back with Hiraeth on his chest. 

Once settled there, his hands stayed on Hiraeth’s hips. His claws were rough and ragged, looking nasty enough to easily be capable of causing those gnarled scars on his leg—and they were about as comfortable on one’s skin as they looked. But he was seemingly very mindful of that, and the talons never pressed hard enough to cause pain, despite brushing over Hiraeth’s body like the caress of lazy knives.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He drifted off, seeming to lose interest in dying on that hill as his attention was drawn more acutely to Hiraeth&#39;s roaming hand, a faint, impossibly deep sound very quietly stirring in his chest, not unlike some of the sounds he made in other forms. Almost comparable to an unsettlingly low purr.

As it just so happened, he was quite well endowed. Almost to the point of beginning to become alarming, but... not <em>quite</em>. And while the heat of his body wasn&#39;t anything notable, especially in comparison to the warmth Hiraeth was capable of putting off, he was currently at about half-mast, evidently not as bored and annoyed as his tone seemed to imply.

He chuckled dryly. &quot;Yeah, you would&#39;ve destroyed me with this monster.&quot;

He at least certainly wasn&#39;t shy about the handy he was giving Valkyn, nor was he unskilled, but that was purely speaking from his familiarity with his own similar anatomy - even if Valkyn was on a larger scale.

Still, the drow didn&#39;t move much, not even really making any noise apart from that deep, quiet rumbling that came and went in soft waves. If Hiraeth wasn&#39;t directly on top of the source, he could be forgiven for thinking the sound was coming from under the house.

At his request, Valkyn didn&#39;t respond immediately. His attention faltered momentarily as he had to forcibly shut off the very distracting stimuli and think critically on whether or not some sort of harm could come of that. It was obviously not permissible for any discharge from his eye to end up in anyone&#39;s mouth (<em>Jaska</em>), but... he hadn&#39;t exactly had opportunities to discover if that applied to other bodily fluids. He bled red blood, had normal, clear tears and saliva, and <em>had</em> taken care of his own needs in his isolation enough to be able to confirm his seed looked normal, too. But were passing appearances sufficient indicators of safety? 

If there were other people with conditions like his, he&#39;d never heard any whisper of them--and not for a lack of searching, before his imprisonment. There was no precedent. There was no research, no known <em>anything</em>. For all he knew, something on a molecular level in his bodily fluids was still capable of insidious harm to others. 

The rumbling sound had faded as he stalled in that line of thought for several moments longer than felt like a natural pause in the conversation. Finally, he slowly managed a reply that sounded... less than certain. 

&quot;... You must stop immediately if... something... does not seem right.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He placed a reassuring kiss to Valkyn&#39;s chest again, then released his cock so he could wriggle himself down to lay on his chest between his thighs, pulling his pants down enough to fully free him and give him unhindered access.

The anxiety was still present, and likely would not be leaving completely any time soon, but he was only a flesh and blood mortal at the end of the day (more or less), and even his well-honed pessimism and contrition could only do so much to suppress the first tongue on his cock in gods knew how long.

He propped his shoulders up on his elbows, watching Hiraeth with an expression that... certainly was affected by the pleasure, in some muted way, but also did not completely exclude the subtle lines in his face caused by that lingering worry, his gaze on the tiefling not just for his own gratification, but so he could hopefully see anything that needed to be noticed before something bad happened.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There was no escaping that it felt good, though. As Hiraeth settled into more of a rhythm, Valkyn gradually shifted his weight to one elbow, freeing his other hand to slide up the side of his face, unhurriedly running his fingers through his hair. 

It&#39;s not like he had forgotten <em>everything</em> of his earlier life, and... some memories were certainly being jogged. But they were odd memories to recall again, tasting vaguely bittersweet, entirely alien, and with an aftertaste that couldn&#39;t decide if it was deja vu or nostalgia. Or grief.

It left what emotion made it onto his muted features a similarly odd concoction of pleasure, worry, something unknown and distantly unsettling--perhaps even the faintest echoes of some sort of sadness--and back to pleasure.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

For a moment, then, one particular thrust and a light cough on Hiraeth&#39;s part had Valkyn&#39;s cock sucked into the hot, wet clamp of his throat, until the tiefling&#39;s gag reflex surged and he had to pull his head back slightly with a gasp, squeezing and stroking him until he could lower his head to take him into his mouth once more.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As much as his <em>body</em> wanted him to pin the tiefling&#39;s head in place and shove his cock right back down his throat--even in that brief moment, his grip in his hair had actually loosened, as he reflexively, deliberately forced himself away from that impulse.

Gods, he looked beautiful like that. He shuddered lightly against his own touch, squeezing himself firmly to the sight, and dipped down to take him in once more.

He could already tell his throat was going to be sore, but it was well worth it to see him like this, and the third time Hiraeth took a breath and brought him down into his throat, he managed to take him in entirely, until his lips pressed to the root of him and his chin nestled atop his balls, throat working around him and fingers grasping tightly against his hip, pulling and encouraging him to thrust even as he closed his eyes and tears streamed down his cheeks.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

When he did not, it didn&#39;t take much waiting before he obliged the pull on his hip, carefully grinding up into the back of his throat with short thrusts that were most likely deliberately reined in from what he reflexively wanted to do.

It didn&#39;t take hardly any time from there for his pleasure to peak. Though his hand had been driven off of Hiraeth&#39;s head by some subconscious manner of restraint, it still hovered a few inches away, claws twitching towards him as that white hot fire flooded through his core and limbs, flooding the back of Hiraeth&#39;s throat with similarly hot spurts of seed that hopefully, probably, weren&#39;t going to be lethal to him. As he gradually crashed down over the peak of that climax, the breath that had been caught in his chest finally released in an impossibly deep, grinding growl that sounded both appropriately strangled, and entirely inhuman.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The only step that seemed to pose issues for him was working around a lit fireplace; he was squinting the whole time, and for placing and removing the teapot, he more or less wasn&#39;t able to actually look directly at what he was doing. But he managed it without complaint, and Hiraeth didn&#39;t have to wait long before he&#39;d sorted out a mug of fresh, steaming tea, only working a little slower than average as he took his time, careful to do things correctly. 

He moved back over to Hiraeth&#39;s bedside, wordlessly and expressionlessly offering it to him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Perhaps predictably, he gave no expression or sound to indicate his impression of the flavor, handing the mug back to Hiraeth once he had taken his sip. &quot;...

The following day Hiraeth had made a trip into town, returning the books Valkyn had finished and checking out some others from the library, and also making a pit stop at one of the local sex shops for some lube. He spent some time talking to the worker about advice for trying anal sex for the first time and accommodating a rather large partner, and the worker even threw in a little tin of a sampler gel that they had that would help him loosen up, so to speak.

Modern magic could produce such wonders, these days. He wasn&#39;t sure how impressed Valkyn would be, though. It was hard to tell, sometimes.

&quot;I&#39;m home,&quot; he announced as he made his way through the front door, setting his messenger bag down on the counter and pulling out the books and supplies. &quot;Anything exciting happen while I was out?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was well accustomed to sitting in one place for extended periods of time, doing absolutely nothing. He also was not in his drow body, as he seemed to largely prefer lounging around in the shape of something inhuman, for unknown reasons. In his cave, it had often been the forms of ambush predators in case things like stray wolves tumbled in and provided him with a rare and precious source of protein. But here, with less of a need for tactics like that, it was just what he was most comfortable with more often that not. Which tended to be the form Hiraeth had grown a fancy for, conveniently for him.

His head had been raised as Hiraeth had come through the door--<em>expecting</em> it to be Hiraeth, but with no small part of him ready to act very differently if it was someone else. But as the tiefling stepped inside, the massive head lowered again, chin resting on the floor with his skull tilted slightly so gravity would aid in keeping his eye socket from oozing. At Hiraeth&#39;s question, there was only a dull grumble of a sound, deep and alien, and the clawed end of his tail gave a little flick that looked rather dismissive.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As Hiraeth&#39;s touch became a bit more scandalous, there was a pause, before a faint sound came as his tail slithered to loosely encircle the two in a wide arc. 

His idle sniffing had concluded, and he now simply... watched Hiraeth. It was hard to glean how he was feeling from his emotionless visage, but there was a sort of subtly withheld nature to his posture. As if still dealing with his chronic uncertainty. 

At least Hiraeth already had a baseline for his demeanor during humanoid-on-humanoid intimacy, and so had no evidence to suggest that this <em>particular</em> endeavor was causing problems. At least, no more than the dense drow would probably manifest in any other version of intimacy.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Hiraeth would likely have already been able to tell by now that his particular arrangement involved a sheath. It was rather subtle amongst the rest of his anatomy most of the time, sometimes even making it easy to miss or giving him a very plastic-doll silhouette. But it was much harder to miss up close, especially when touch was involved. 

His hide over most his body was nearly hardened, not quite chitinous like a beetle&#39;s shell, but with very little squish or wrinkle, not unlike the head of a crocodile. But his undersides became a bit softer, a bit more pliable, and the centerline of his stomach beneath where his ribs ended seemed to be the softest region. Even outside of it being comparatively softer to the rest of his hide, it was surprisingly soft in and of itself; if Hiraeth had ever experienced holding a species of gecko who stored fat in their tails, making them visibly plump in the process, he would find the texture comparable to that.

When he seemed sated on that front, he pushed himself back to his feet, careful to keep his grip on Hiraeth&#39;s hip steady and to not jostle him in the process. 

He was... about the size of a horse. And Hiraeth was the size of a person. Their bodies were not exactly meant to arrange intuitively with one another for such an activity. Having Hiraeth beneath his hips meant he was too far back to give Valkyn much to leverage with using his front half, and so it wasn&#39;t as straight forward as just mounting him and getting to it. He moved slow and careful as he stepped over him, one foreleg bracing his weight while the other slid back and under Hiraeth&#39;s stomach, unnervingly long talons curled around the most vulnerable region on his torso to provide some semblance of leverage against the tiefling. Ultimately, he ended up somewhat crouched to allow their bodies to properly touch at all--though at least this form seemed to have the flexibility of something cat-like, and not the horse it was closer to in size.

The whole time, his head was held low, curled to the side to keep his eye trained on Hiraeth, though the lack of emoting made it a tossup whether his gaze was still wary and critical, or something else. For all Hiraeth knew, he felt just as much the predator he wore the anatomy of, and was reveling in it.

It didn&#39;t take much adjusting for the rather pointed tip of his cock to find Hiraeth&#39;s entrance. Where Valkyn&#39;s movements had been slow thus far, they slowed even further to a crawl as his tail and claw tightened against him ever so slightly, his hips tilting to begin <em>very gradually</em> pushing into him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But once he seemed relatively confident that nothing was going horribly awry, his foreleg&#39;s grip on Hiraeth&#39;s stomach and hip adjusted slightly, a foot or two also readjusting their position on the floor, and he began to pick up a more rhythmic pace. Still not particularly fast, he hadn&#39;t thrown all caution to the wind.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
