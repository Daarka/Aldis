Most mornings had resulted in frost on the windows and left the grass and leaves crunchy. About the only ones really enthused about this change were the huskies. Kaleva didn&#39;t mind it, but the tiefling could literally stand outside on those cold mornings and just have steam gently rising off his skin. Atreyu found himself toasting in front of the fireplace more and more often. His lanky shape and wispy, thin fur didn&#39;t do much for insulation against the cold.

Achoris had gone on his adventure with Luka into Cusai and was due to return soon. Which was lucky, because the skies were thick with dark clouds, and the wind was starting to pick up. Kaleva had mentioned to Skena that it looked like they might get a blizzard. As night was about to fall, Atreyu lifted his head suddenly, then let out a single bark of &#39;someone&#39;s here!&#39; and went to the doorway, sniffing intently at the crease and wagging his tail excitedly.

Sure enough, it was Achoris - and he was riding a hound of his own, a female with sandy golden and white fur, which faded to darker brown on her ears. Both of them were hunched against the wind, shivering and ill-equipped for the weather.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He took the brush out of his mouth to speak properly. &quot;Yeah, I guess it has gotten a bit nippy. Pretty sure we&#39;ll have a couple of feet of snow by morning, so you made it back in good time. Who&#39;s this?&quot; He stepped forward toward the hound, lifting a hand to cup her muzzle in his palm.

&quot;<em>Nippy,</em> he says,&quot; Achoris muttered. &quot;This is Anouke. I gave Ilex some coin and had him go into Cautica to purchase her for me. Eight years old, excellent pedigree, well trained. Headstrong and stubborn when not working. We&#39;ve been getting along.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Atreyu followed at a distance and laid down on his stomach to gaze at her wistfully, his tail wagging with hope. She completely ignored him. &quot;I was starting to feel claustrophobic, particularly after the Incident with Valentine and Jaska. It was good to go home for a while. And Luka enjoyed the ruins we explored.&quot;

Kaleva slipped back inside with the two puppies, closing the door behind him and heading back to the bathroom to spit out his toothpaste and rinse out his mouth. The puppies immediately locked on to Anouke and dropped to their bellies to wiggle up to her with wagging tails and appeasing whimpers as they licked at her mouth, which she deigned acceptable behavior, even wagging her tail back at them.

Cass smiled softly, nodding. “I always have more of that tea than I’m capable of using myself. Not much else that I expect Kaleva would appreciate me bringing into their home, though.” With that, she disappeared back inside to go put together a tin of the ruddy maroon blend. A few moments later, she re-emerged with a wool shawl bundled around her shoulders, staff in hand, and the tin tucked away in some pocket hidden in the layers of her dress, stepping out into the frigid air and tilting her head to turn her good eye towards the sky thoughtfully. 

“I’ve not actually been in Fielbarry through a winter yet. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it all feels… Mm. Familiar.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

While Cass was getting ready, Nils finished stacking the rest of the firewood against the side of his parents&#39; house, and ducked in looking enough to let them know they were running to Skena and Kaleva&#39;s. Margret practically shoved a container of krumkake in his hands, and Stefan added a book from his collection about the churches of Holbrook and the various gods and religious practices that took place in them, past and present, that he thought Skena would find interesting. He had bookmarked the chapter on burial practices. He also put a small boot knife and a sheath on top of it, the handle made of bone with mountains and forest carved into it. &#39;For Kaleva,&#39; he said with a nod. &#39;And you make sure they don&#39;t try to give these things back.&#39;

Nils tucked everything in a pack and shouldered it along with his shield, looking to Cass as they set off. &quot;I&#39;ve heard they&#39;re milder here than in Holbrook, but that storm still looks nasty. Might get snowed in for a couple days.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Cass hummed a thoughtful note. &quot;I&#39;d be surprised if winters this far south were as harsh as those in Holbrook. But I&#39;m glad for that. A bit of home, without it being so severe that my poor joints all seize up for the entire season.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

While Cass and Nils made their way over, Kaleva instructed Skena how to make the corn bread while he focused on the soup, and Achoris looked on peacefully, content to just vibe after his long travels.

The first flakes of snow were starting to fall by the time they arrived, though calling them flakes was generous... The wind made them into icy needles that slapped viciously against the skin, and froze in their hair and on their shoulders. &quot;Ska&#240;i, you bitch,&quot; Nils wheezed as they trudged up to the cabin. &quot;Couldn&#39;t have waited just a little longer...&quot; He pounded on the door, and the huskies inside started barking, which immediately escalated into howling.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Because Song was, in fact, wearing a diaper. A little chastity diaper. The puppies were growing up.

&quot;On that note, Mom and Dad sent gifts,&quot; Nils said as he brought his pack into the kitchen, reaching in to put the container of desserts on the table. &quot;Krumkake from Mom - they&#39;re crispy pastry rolls filled with sweet cream - and then from Dad, a book for you,&quot; he handed off the book to Skena, &quot;and a boot knife for you.&quot; He passed the knife over to Kaleva, who took it with a dumbfounded expression, clearly not having expected or anticipated getting such a thing, turning it over in his hands. &quot;He wanted me to stress that these are gifts and therefore not to be returned.&quot;

Kaleva blinked a couple of times, his eyes a bit suspiciously misty, and mumbled a thanks.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Nils did a double-take at that. &quot;...You guys have a really weird family tree.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

You do not need to account for me, I&#39;ll manage just fine.&quot; She almost went on to say that from what she understood, her and Nils were very accustomed to sleeping without modern accommodations--but she couldn&#39;t say that with her full chest without phrasing it in such a way that made it clear she didn&#39;t actually <em>know</em> her own past. And while that wasn&#39;t much of a secret, she still didn&#39;t tend to make a habit of disclosing it for one reason or another, and she at least had the working memory these days to know it had not previously been explained to this household. A part of her wasn&#39;t entirely sure why she didn&#39;t disclose it, but the mystery didn&#39;t bother her much. In reality, it could likely just be chalked up to the somewhat aloof tendencies of shadar-kai; she was not much of an oversharer. 

Skena nodded thoughtfully. &quot;... The bed is probably big enough to fit Achoris along with us,&quot; she offered, &quot;Which would leave Nils the couch, and Cass could make herself comfortable wherever else she found appealing.&quot; She had spent enough sleepovers with her uncle to not find the idea strange or uncomfortable, but she eyed Kaleva all the same to gauge his reaction. She wouldn&#39;t have put him in the position of answering in front of everyone if she thought there was a good chance it would be a hard no for him, but her eyes on his face were the ones that were actively plugged in to his every microexpression, ready to alleviate the potential pressure created at the first sign of discontent.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Couch is plenty fine,&quot; Nils said with a nod.

Nils nodded a bit, taking another mouthful of soup. &quot;Mm. Working with the Flamekeepers was sort of adjacent to that. Though different members had different roles depending on their ability to blend in. For me and Cass, we went to various locations helping smuggle vulnerable people out to safe places, and sometimes did assassination work, taking down the biggest threats to the work we did when other methods were exhausted.

The puppy pulled back his lips into an appeasing smile, ears airplaned to the sides, wagging his tail lowly as he wiggled up to Skena, trying to put his chin in her lap. Love him.

&quot;That face,&quot; Nils said lowly to Cass, smirking. &quot;That face, right there, is why I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be a good dog owner. They&#39;d get away with everything.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;But there were a lot of dogs around me growing up. I&#39;m not immune--I <em>love</em> this little boy--but if I don&#39;t maintain the boundary that they&#39;re supposed to stay out of this area, they&#39;ll take a mile from whatever inch I give. And I genuinely can&#39;t have them freely accessing my workshop, it&#39;s not puppy-safe in there,&quot; she noted, nodding towards the hallway to the side of the dinning room that led a short distance to a curtained doorway. 

She walked the dangling puppy back over to the partitioning wall with a bit of difficulty, slumping him back down on the other side. Leaning down, she planted a consolation kiss on his forehead, before straightening up again. 

&quot;We&#39;ll cuddle after dinner. But you mind your manners until then. How did you even get over this?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The solution to that little question was Atreyu, who was laying next to the partition, giving Finch an &#39;I-told-you-so&#39; look. Apparently he&#39;d been the launch pad. Or the box that Finch used to climb up and over. But Finch was nonplussed, bouncing over to grab a knotted string of rope and shaking it, then scampering off as Song immediately launched herself after him to try to take it for herself.

Anouke and Atreyu both just laid there and watched the shenanigans.

&quot;We need to assert dominance,&quot; Kaleva agreed. &quot;Otherwise they won&#39;t listen to a thing we say that doesn&#39;t interest them, and that can be dangerous if they get into something they shouldn&#39;t. Like porcupines, or skunks.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He&#39;s smart enough that I don&#39;t doubt he learned his lesson permanently about porcupines.&quot;

There was a pause, before Cass hesitated. &quot;... How large was he as a puppy?&quot;

Skena grinned slightly, sitting down. &quot;About the size of a foal.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
