He was using a prop tonight, two long sticks that he held in his hands, which connected to each other with a long swath of cloth cut in the shape of wings. The way he moved them made him appear as a quetzalcoatl soaring across the stage, dipping and diving in sinuous motions.

He applauded when the performance had concluded, tossing a gold coin into the tip jar that was brought around, and finished off his wine before deciding to head home for the night.

Gradually, he became aware that he was being followed. The soft tap of footfalls appeared in the corners of his vision, and when he glanced over his shoulder, the man who was walking a dozen paces behind him shifted his gaze elsewhere, hands in his pockets, seeming to walk casually along.

He didn&#39;t think much of it. Sometimes people walked in the same direction to get where they were going. It was a pretty decently sized town, after all. And what did he have to fear? Why should he fear being jumped in a place like Fielbarry?

Niko tensed suddenly when he felt the vibration of footfalls right behind him, and just as he turned around again, a club hit him upside the head and knocked him prone. Dazed and disoriented, he barely comprehended as he was dragged quickly into a dark side alley, one of his fancy leather loafers left in the street in his wake.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Arseni had actually been headed <em>to</em> the tavern, bored out of his mind. So he would have likely crossed paths with Niko as they both moved along the same route between his home and the Creeping Root. Instead, he came upon his shoe.

There was a very good chance Arseni would have thought nothing of it and continued on. But something about it snagged his attention, and when he paused to look at it properly, he noted how high quality it was—and even his dense skull was capable of acknowledging the oddity of that being lying in the street. As he stood there, unintelligently staring at it with a dial-up noise behind his eyes, something actually managed to click: he’d seen it before. He knew who it belonged to. 

His whole posture shifted, pupils narrowing to razor slits before dilating to  probe through the evening darkness as he lifted his head, looking around and listening for a moment.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sounds of heavy breathing.

Well away from the street, Niko&#39;s attacker had dragged him and shoved him between a pair of trash bins. His coinpurse, platinum pocket watch, ear cuff, and a silver bracelet had already been removed and shoved into the pockets of his attacker. And then his pants had been removed, and the man had decided to take his pleasure as well.

Nikotiemus&#39; moonlit hair and pale skin shone like a beacon in that dark alley, and the blood staining the side of his head and caking his hair looked inky black. He was clearly concussed, his hands held above his head in the grip of one of the man&#39;s hands while the other held his hip and he drove himself into the changeling&#39;s body, again and again, while Niko&#39;s head lolled against his collarbone and he dazedly blinked, a small, vulnerable noise whimpered in his throat.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

By the time he caught sight of what had happened—<em>was</em> happening—his entire body had started to smolder.

That light—a tiefling-shaped meteor of flames and magma—slammed into the assailant, battering him into the wall with a bull-rushed collision. Fortunately for both the stranger and Niko’s belongings in his pockets, Arseni quickly flew into a rage that made it impossible to produce additional flame. Unfortunately for the stranger, that rage was a problem all it’s own, as he barely missed a beat after slamming the man into the wall, dragging him upright again and viciously cracking him across the face with his nearly chitinous fist.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Released from his hold, his body jostled by having his attacker bulldozed off of him, Nikotiemus rolled himself onto his side, dazedly pushing himself up onto his hands and knees and breathing raggedly.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In response to the kick, Arseni&#39;s tail whipped around to firmly constrict around the man&#39;s ankle, and he twisted to bring his own heel down on the side of the man&#39;s knee with the full force of wanting to snap that limb in half like a twig.

The blood and fire gradually leaving his eyes, he lifted his head, looking around a moment to find where Niko had crawled off to.

His bedside manner was lacking; despite not trying to be rough, there was a rather innate roughness to his touch--and his hands were uncomfortably hot, though not quite to the point of burning.

But Nikotiemus wanted his pants, which was understandable. Making sure he wasn&#39;t going to collapse if he let go of him (which was interesting only because Arseni was a full head shorter), the tiefling slowly released him, turning to go retrieve where his pants had been discarded. He walked them back to Niko, pushing them into his hands, and then... gently, albeit a bit awkwardly, guiding him towards the wall so he had something stable to lean on. That accomplished, Arseni stalked back over to the stranger, both unaware he was dead and uncaring of the fact, to drop to a knee and start digging around his pockets. Mostly he wanted to get that gods-damned ear cuff back; he had stolen it from the guild fair and square and it was rightfully his. Not really caring to distinguish the man&#39;s belongings from Nikotiemus&#39;, he ultimately cleaned out anything of value in his pockets at all, walking it back to Niko afterwards and presenting the pile for him to pick through--though he shifted the load momentarily to use two claws to pick the ear cuff out of the pile, holding that towards him first and foremost.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He looked up at the cuff that was held out, and though he took it in his hand, he didn&#39;t put it back on in that moment, preferring to put it in his pocket instead. He didn&#39;t want to deal with the distracting lettering while he could barely see straight. His coinpurse, watch, and bracelet were returned to his pockets as well, but he seemed to want little to do with the rest - some keys, a vial full of a clear, oily liquid, and another coinpurse far lighter than his own.

Nikotiemus looked over at the unmoving body of his attacker, and he signed a single question toward Arseni. <em>&#39;Dead?&#39;</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Well, if Nikotiemus was indifferent, Arseni was impulsive and spiteful and would gladly make the decision for him.

Moving back to the man for a final time, he made sure Nikotiemus would have clear line of sight to him as he violently stomped his heel into the man&#39;s neck, hearing the bones crack under the blow. Then, for good measure--and because it was the best solution to any problem--he spit a mote of fire down onto the body, which was most definitely a corpse now if it hadn&#39;t been before. As soon as it impacted, the fire blossomed to engulf the entire body, and Arseni stepped over it--seemingly unbothered by the flames that licked over him in the process--and made his way back to Nikotiemus. Reaching his side, he unceremoniously pulled Niko&#39;s arm around his shoulders, granting him warm, smoky, slightly spiky, but <em>sturdy</em> stability. 

He lingered there for a moment, his gaze pulled to the conflagration he had created, some sort of primal satisfaction being served to watch it burn. But he hadn&#39;t forgotten the sound the man had made, and ultimately tore his eyes away, sliding his other arm around Nikotiemus&#39; waist to start steering him further into the dark alleys--because he was familiar and comfortable with the places criminals lingered and used to get around town--heading back towards their home through a less overt path. Any time he felt Niko start to slump or trip, he gave him a soft jostle or pricked his hand with one of the claws wrapped around it; he could probably carry him if he had to despite Niko being larger, but even his dumb ass knew it was important that he not pass out.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, May 9, 2022 11:34 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>
