It was an experience in itself trying to find a teaching style that worked for her, but whatever it took, he&#39;d make sure she had an education. They were working on math problems, and as a visual aid, he had some dry beans on the table and was working on her addition and subtraction.

He tensed at a sudden rapid pounding on the door, sharply glancing up with a scowl. He wasn&#39;t expecting anyone, so who...? 

Rising up, he made his way to the window near the door and moved the curtain just enough to peek out. Seeing Luka there had his scowl worsening. His brother looked... hm. Like he was just barely keeping himself from flying into a panic. What the hell.

He unlocked and opened up the door, frowning at him. &quot;The hell do you wa-&quot;

&quot;Valentine is gone,&quot; Luka blurted out, interrupting him. &quot;We were supposed to meet, but she wasn&#39;t home, and I tried alerting her through the ring and she never responded.&quot;

Jaska blinked, then narrowed his eyes, curtly gesturing him in and closing the door behind him, thumbing his own ring to reach out to her. &quot;She&#39;s not in the tavern?&quot;

Luka shook his head. &quot;No, I asked around and no one&#39;s seen her since she left to stay with me last night. And she left my place this morning.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

An experience indeed, as her naturally aloof and somewhat unpredictable behavior coupled with her largely nonvocal nature made it <em>very</em> hard to ascertain if she understood something or not.

But the knock on the door had her bristling alongside Jaska, and that tension did not ease as Luka stepped in and explained his presence. 

She slowly padded after Jaska, towards where he and her uncle were standing, her expression its usual empty self--but a tight twitching back and forth of her tail betraying her discomfort as she tried to make sense of what was being discussed. 

True to what Luka had reported, but very concerningly, Jaska&#39;s sister&#39;s voice did not enter his mind in response to his touch of the ring. For the first time, ever.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;<em>Axa and I</em> are going to--&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not leaving me behind,&quot; he cut in firmly. &quot;She&#39;s my sister too.&quot;

Jaska sucked in a sharp breath through his nose, growling out a noise of frustration. &quot;Then stay behind me and don&#39;t get in my way. First, I&#39;m going to reach out to my contacts, see if anyone had eyes on Valentine today that might have seen anything. Then, while they are looking for information, we will go to see Skena.

Something that, more than likely, was new to Luka; she hadn&#39;t exactly had a reason or circumstance to have them out around her uncle prior to this. And it was mildly unsettling, how otherwise normal she appeared to Luka, and that usual, fairly empty expression... all silently framed in rather nasty looking weapons that shadowed her as if loyal and obedient pets.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

They made a quick stop at a seedy tavern Luka had never been to before and looked sorely out of place in, and earned several confused stares from the people who... well. They knew Jaska had siblings, had seen Valentine, but seeing Luka and Jaska in the same room together willingly was odd. A word with the bartender to send out feelers for any information on Valentine, and the trio were off to Finders Keepers to head up to the portal door and knock on it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;...Valentine&#39;s missing,&quot; Luka began. &quot;She left my house this morning and--&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s not responding to our summons, no one&#39;s seen her at the tavern.

That relief was short-lived as she listened to the reason for their visit, her expression twisting slightly in gentle worry. &quot;Oh. Yes, I can...&quot; A pause, as she seemed to mentally go through something. &quot;... Yes. Yes, I should be able to help. Um. One moment.&quot;

She turned away from them, skittering back more deeply into the home. &quot;I&#39;d say to make yourselves comfortable, but that feels a little tone-deaf,&quot; she continued over her shoulder. &quot;Regardless, this might take a moment. So feel free to sit down somewhere.&quot;

Disappearing through the dinning room and into her work space, she was gone a few seconds, before reappearing with a little bundle in hand. It looked like merely an odd shape of rigid cloth at first, but a closer look would yield that it seemed to be some manner of small mummified body, likely of a small animal wrapped in meticulously treated and gold leaf decorated linens. 

&quot;So, um. As convenient as it would be if I could just ask my god where she is, this kind of magic is not so direct. I cannot ask questions regarding just... the truthfulness of general facts, such as where she is or if she&#39;s okay. I have to approach it as a question regarding an event that will happen within the next several days. I can ask where she will be found within that time, but... that means there&#39;s a possibility I will not receive an answer. Which I would presume to mean she would not be found within that time frame.&quot; Her words were quick enough to not feel like she was wasting time, but measured enough to not sound rushed. 

&quot;I guess--I just want to give you both an idea of... what to expect? It can be a little abstract sometimes...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Like she not only absorbed both of their tension and anxiety, but it ricocheted around inside of her, amplifying on top of itself into something volatile and lacking an outlet.

Skena nodded, not wasting further time with discussion. Heading over to the little shrine to Anubis set up in the corner of the dinning room, she settled down on her knees, placing the mummified bundle in front of her and taking a deep breath.

For a while, it didn&#39;t appear anything was happening. But she could faintly be heard whispering under her breath in celestial, and not long after, the mummified bundle began to glow ever so slightly, dissolving soundlessly into golden particles of light that drifted up and blinked out like embers. Simultaneously, her complexion warped, the opacity bleeding out of her skin until she was little more than a collection of bones and organs, seemingly contained within a glass vessel. Around the crown of her head, a halo like a trail of golden stardust began to twinkle into subtle but charming existence.

More silence stretched on. And then she opened her eyes, and they had become consumed in a soft, golden light. Her head moved minutely, as if she were looking around some... and then the light all faded in a matter of seconds, leaving her eyes blinking glassy lids. The bundle she had set in front of her was gone, and over the next minute or two, her complexion would gradually return to normal--but for now, at least, the little halo remained.

&quot;She&#39;s still in town,&quot; Skena spoke up again, blinking a few more times as if to refocus her vision as she slowly pushed herself back to her feet. &quot;Not in the places she usually is, and... I don&#39;t think it&#39;s by her choosing. But... for whatever it&#39;s worth, I... I mean nothing of this nature was explicitly offered to me, but... I truly don&#39;t get the feeling she&#39;s dead or grievously hurt or anything,&quot; she added gently. &quot;What vague little I saw seemed to be indicative of her... I don&#39;t know, sitting up? In a way that didn&#39;t strike me as a position you could be in without being conscious and relatively alert. But... the details are fuzzy.&quot; She shook her head a little.

&quot;... I... don&#39;t know how to direct you to where that location is, exactly,&quot; she added, squinting as she sorted through the memory of her vision, &quot;But... He seemed to think another detail was more important than that. I think... I was looking at your front door...?&quot; She continued, looking up at Jaska pointedly. &quot;I saw a plain white envelope drop onto the doormat. I think. I didn&#39;t see any writing on it or... any markings or anything.&quot; A beat. &quot;I get the feeling that aspect of the vision was a bit more literal.&quot;

Her brows had stayed furrowed most of this entire time, and she tilted her head slightly at Jaska. &quot;... If... I-I mean, I have no idea what you&#39;re all tangled up with here, but... if it would make either of you feel a little better to have a dedicated healer on standby... I&#39;m... I&#39;m happy to tag along in case I can be of assistance. I&#39;m not sure what else I could offer that you don&#39;t already have covered somehow, but... it&#39;d feel cold to just send you on your way now.&quot;

She was sure that Achoris, if he was eavesdropping, would take issue with her involving herself in Jaska and Valentine&#39;s dangers, but... well. That chaos was becoming a bit of the norm for her. She doubted it was anything terribly far over her head.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;A ransom note?&quot; Luka echoed, alarmed. &quot;Why would--&quot;

&quot;Not important,&quot; Jaska snapped. To Skena, he said, &quot;Gather whatever you think you need, but be quick. Whatever Valentine&#39;s state, I would not want any delays to worsen it.&quot;

Luka exhaled sharply, a bit testily, but he stood up and turned to her with a strained smile. &quot;Thank you, Skena.&quot; And then to the shrine, &quot;And thank you as well, Anubis.

Jaska snapped his head around, then stormed up to get in his face - or at least as well as he could given the height difference. &quot;<em>Why would you offer to help?</em> Gods know you&#39;d rather do the opposite where Valentine is concerned.&quot;

Achoris sneered at Jaska, leaning down until they were practically nose to nose. &quot;I don&#39;t offer for her sake or yours. But if you&#39;re taking my niece and my friend into danger, it becomes my business if anything happens to them. So if you don&#39;t want me getting involved, <em>keep them safe.</em>&quot;

Luka cut in sharply, &quot;We have more important things to fuss about! I know we&#39;re all a bit keyed up, but you can bicker until you&#39;re blue in the face <em>after</em> we get Valentine back. Or get a room, I don&#39;t care!&quot;

Both Achoris and Jaska stared at Luka for a moment, a bit shocked. Then Achoris grinned widely while Jaska huffed and turned for the door.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Axa looked about ready to combust. Jaska was her source of stability, and seeing him unraveling in such a way left her especially volatile herself. Achoris held her attention briefly, only while the tension between them lasted and she seemed to be contemplating involving herself.

Valentine gradually came to, her head feeling fuzzy and strange. It had been a good decade or so since the last time she had ever fallen asleep, and so the sensations of regaining consciousness that had previously been stolen from her was mildly alarming. As soon as she had enough of her wits regained… all of her sharped to a dangerous edge.

She was seated in a chair. She couldn’t move her hands. She wasn’t alone; there were the idle shifting of one other body. Opposite her. The floor beneath her feet felt like wooden boards, but the air smelled faintly dank, stale. A finished (to some extent) room below ground level. She took inventory of all her extremities, noting everything of her body still felt intact. The amethyst she wore around her neck was naturally concealed under her weather-appropriate attire—not that it had the ability to assist her at the moment. She couldn’t tell if her ring remained on… she was having a hard time moving her fingers. Some minute shifting later, the faintest creak of leather finished the image in her mind; some sort of gloves on her hands, somehow of a design that anchored her fingertips in place where her hands had been positioned to clasp, fingers neatly laced together. Like a straight jacket. 

She waited until her mind was clear enough for her to have her confidence back before making any larger movements. And so when she did, it was a smooth, gentle straightening of her back and lifting of her head, a deep breath being drawn in as she cast a very cordial smile towards the sound of breathing. 

“… If you have a monologue, you may proceed with it,” she said, her voice it’s usual warm self. 

Her company did not answer immediately, and she could all but feel the blank look on their face. Then the voice of a gruff male.

“Sorry to disappoint, sugartits.” The sound of weight shifting on a second chair, then lifting from it. Two unhurried steps in her direction.

“You’re the one who needs to do the talkin’. Here’s how this is gonna work.”

Val had good ears; she knew the subtle sound of a dagger being drawn from a leather sheath.

“I’m gonna ask a question. You’re gonna give me an answer. The right answer. Every time you don’t… we’re gonna choose little pieces of you to carve off and scatter in the woods like bread crumbs for your brother to find.”

Val, of course, was unfazed. “Ah, I see,” she said with a nod. “Well, I <em>have</em> been thinking about taking some length off my ears… but you know, I’ll handle that on my own time, no need to cause a fuss for a gentleman such as yourself. I’d like to propose a counter-offer,” she went on silkily. “And I think you’ll find my terms very agreeable, so do hear me out; I have one single question I wish to ask of <em>you</em>. In exchange, I will tell you all of Jaska’s deepest, darkest secrets. If you have the means and the desire, I will submit to divination magics that can confirm the truthfulness of what I have to say. And I consider myself a fair and charitable woman—I will even give you those secrets first, so long as we do have a deal, and I will have my question answered at the end. Furthermore,” she went on, with the same hospitable warmth as that which she sold inn rooms with, “I can sweeten the deal even more. You may place any hard limits on what my question may contain. For instance, if you are worried I intend to ask sensitive information about yourself or your companions or even where I am currently being held, you may prohibit me from doing so, and I can ensure my singular question does not infringe on these terms.” She smiled with all the sunshine she always had, her tail swaying very casually and relaxed over the floor. “Do we have a deal?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>
<div class=chatlog__message-group><div id=chatlog__message-container-1063761112232906833 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1063761112232906833><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><img class=chatlog__avatar src="/icons/Daarka.png" alt=Avatar loading=lazy></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__header><span class=chatlog__author style=color:rgb(192,106,155) title=daarka data-user-id=164583493953650688>Daarka</span> <span class=chatlog__timestamp title="Saturday, January 14, 2023 2:06 AM"><a href=#chatlog__message-container-1063761112232906833>1/14/2023 2:06 AM</a></span></div><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Silence. That feeling again, the soundless indication of a blanked out expression.

More silence. No doubt, this interaction was not a script he had prepared for.

“… Alright,” he said slowly, his tone one of cautiously humoring her. “I’ll bite. This better be good, or we do things my way. But worse, if you’ve wasted my time.” There was a small crunch of something, like a small piece of glass being crushed, and Valentine felt a wash of magic course through her, a feeling of critical omnipotence. And, true to her word, she succumbed to it without a fight. Good.

She beamed gently at him. “Forgive me for not shaking on it,” she replied, lifting her restrained hands pointedly. “But very well. What would you like to prohibit me making my question about?”

Another lengthy silence, wherein the stranger no doubt tried to predict where she was going with all this. Finally—unable to reach any such revelation—he grunted back. “No questions about us. None about where we are. Not our actions, our plans, our names, our histories… and nothing about your current <em>predicament</em>.” He sounded faintly smug with his rules, confident he had removed her ability to ask a question that mattered. But if he hoped for a pang of disappointment, he would be left wanting.

Val nodded easily. “Certainly. That is perfectly doable.” 

Settling back more comfortably—and realizing, as she did so, she was bound to the chair as well via ropes of some nature encircling her upper torso to the back of the chair—she neatly folded one leg up over the opposite knee, looking remarkably ladylike for her circumstances.

“You won’t believe me, but Jaska is quite young. Or, perhaps, inconceivably old. He did not have a childhood—which I do not mean in the poetic way. I mean that to say he was implanted into the body of my twin brother many years ago, by a malevolent eldritch quasi-deity whom my twin and I had shared a pact with. I went on to entrap and enslave this quasi-deity, who I now carry around everywhere with me and have commandeered its power for my own. Some years after that event, I used said powers to split my two brothers, allowing Jaska a body of his own—one you are familiar with, I take it.  He is very much thriving now, isn’t he? I digress; while we cannot be certain, it seems most likely that prior to his injection into my twin’s body, he likely had a life as a star spawn. These are creatures created by Hadar, the dying, life-draining star in the far realms. While he has no memory of this, those with true sight are able to see his body as something very distinctly not of this plane. On that note, his daughter—surely you are familiar? She is immortal. And quite a bit more than that, I’m afraid. You see, within hell, fiends generally work their way into power; they evolve into more powerful species of fiend as they grow in strength and repute, and do not typically reproduce as us mortals do. Yet they <em>can</em>—though I assume infant mortality rates are very high in the nine hells. Consequentially, most fiends—even the highest echelons of archdevils—started off as lowly lemures at the bottom of the totem pole. But when two prestigious devils—or even archdevils—reproduce sexually, they create what is known as a pureblooded devil. A perfect fiend who carries an innate potency to their power that easily surpasses that of their parents. And that, a pureblooded devil, is what Jaska’s daughter is.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Was grateful for it. The truth of their family was outlandish—and she wanted it to sink in for the reality it was.

“Jaska was in the right place at the right time to take her in when she was rather messily summoned onto this plane. And he has absolutely fallen in love with her. You see… Jaska had a hard beginning in this life of his. For a long time, many believed he was merely a figment of my twin’s imagination, amongst other things. Horrible things happened to him as corrupt doctors tried to purge him from my twin’s body and psyche. That heavily shaped who Jaska is. He is deeply paranoid. Painfully slow to trust. And <em>vengeful</em>. I have always loved him unconditionally, and in his own aloof way, he loves me back. And he saw himself in that little girl, too, and he would do anything for her. Raze the world to the ground for her. And she has quickly grown to return that love and devotion. All he has to do is give her his directions, and she has always gotten the job done. She would do anything for him. And—if you will excuse my lack of humility in saying  so—I believe he would do anything for me, too. That little girl and myself are his most closely guarded loves. And I was scheduled to meet with both of my brothers in the late afternoon of the day you encountered me.”

She gave a little shrug. “I’m unsure of the current time, but that does not concern me. It will take very little for my brothers to realize I am not absent of my own accord. Between the two of them, they are immensely resourceful. It is only a matter of time before an eldritch horror stuffed into the body of a tiefling, surging with anxiety and rage over having one of the few things he truly cares about threatened, and the pureblooded fiend whose powers may very well rival that of the entities who rule the individual layers of hell themselves and who lives and breathes to do her adopted father’s bidding both show up in this vicinity. And if Jaska himself does not take out his barely contained fury and vengeance and seething hatred upon everyone here himself, his precious little girl will pass through like an angel of death and likely assure a far worse demise. My brother, the star spawn, an entity of siphoning life from other creatures—nor one of the most powerful varieties of fiend straight from the bowels of hell—have a drop of mercy within them.”

It was all spoken so tenderly. Compassionately, even. She leaned ever so slightly forward, as much as her bindings would allow.

“Which brings me to the question I would like to ask you, and that is: what would you like for me to tell your family?”

She was not remotely surprised that Jaska was being so bloodthirsty about this—but such mentalities were very foreign to her, so understanding his methodologies didn’t come naturally. His explanation, though grim, did at least make sense, however. She fell silent after that, matching his pace as best as she could as she followed after. When he addressed Axa, she reflexively turned her head to glance at the girl… and blinked when she couldn’t find her. Not even tracks in snow to suggest where she had gone, or if she had followed them out of the house at all in the first place.

As Jaska and Skena approached the greenhouse, they got within about fifty feet of it—before a massive, dark shape appeared with unsettling speed despite how little sound it made, snaking out from around behind the greenhouse until the hulking aberration stood in front of it, directly in the visitors’ path. The sudden and monstrous appearance, accompanied by the bone-rattlingly deep rumbles of a snarl, had Skena’s forward momentum stopping on a dime as she let out an involuntary yelp.

But only a second or two passed, before recognition set in, and the monster’s snarls died back to an idle rumble, his posture loosening again as he turned to unhurriedly move aside.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Luka is on his way with a cart and should be here shortly.&quot;

He went to the greenhouse, brushing aside hanging vines and branches obscuring the door, pulling out a set of keys to unlock it and make his way inside, holding the door open for Skena - and Valkyn, if he chose to follow. Despite it being quite cold outside, the moment they stepped in they were engulfed in humid warmth and the fragrant smell of an assortment of herbs and flowers. He led Skena to a cellar door, unlocking that as well, and paused only to put on a mask, passing one to Skena too.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Valkyn, meanwhile, sloughed off his wildshape, pushing back inside to find Hiraeth. &quot;Jaska is here,&quot; he announced flatly, shaking a bit of lingering snow off his hands from where they had been claws on the ground moments prior.

Skena blinked as she was handed a mask, but hesitated only a moment before putting it on, fumbling a little to ensure it fit her petite anatomy. &quot;...

&quot;Even if they don&#39;t get a chance to make off with any of it, this will be good to keep on hand in the event of another similar situation, or if my employees start getting picked off in transport and the inventory stolen.&quot;

Skena looked around, trying to sift through her own capabilities in her mind to figure out if there was a way she could best help. &quot;...

Jaska glanced to her, and though his mouth and nose were hidden beneath the mask, his gaze softened a fraction in appreciation. &quot;Don a pair of gloves. Once I mix the glass in, take the teaspoon to scoop it up and put it in the vials. Cork them and put them back in the box.&quot;

Not long after, Luka arrived with a horse-drawn cart, and Jaska had Skena and Luka help him in loading up a few boxes under the covered tarp. Luka was very deliberately <em>not</em> told about the compromised drug.

They traveled in this manner for some time, with no real indication of what they should be looking out for.

Then, abruptly, two figures stepped out from the trees, placing themselves in the cart&#39;s path. At a glance, they looked like the typical criminal ilk; a half-orc of impressive stature, and a tabaxi with black fur interrupted by various scars, both dressed in dark colors and well-worn attire. The tabaxi had a light crossbow in hand, while the half-orc wielded one that looked notably heavier--and both were trained on the cart&#39;s driver. 

&quot;... Step down. Keep your hands where we can see them. No sudden movements,&quot; the tabaxi hissed.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A bit of sifting, and a vial was held up in the dying light to be scrutinized.

Skena had, likewise, followed Luka and Jaska down from the cart with her hands in plain view, keeping her mouth shut and instead focusing on her particularly keen awareness of things as they happened around her.

Satisfied, the tabaxi, gave his companion a single nod, putting the vial back and jumping back off the cart. 

&quot;Well done. Now explain why you brought <em>these two</em>,&quot; he sneered as he returned to where he had been standing before. &quot;Did you need help driving a wagon?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Assuming the trio did as instructed, the tabaxi and half-orc would follow behind them, leaving the cart where it had stopped as they progressed further into the woods. 

They walked in this fashion for several long minutes, the evening&#39;s darkness creeping in and making the situation feel just a bit more claustrophobic than it would have in broad daylight. Directions were sparsely given, but otherwise, the journey was made in silence.

Eventually, after scaling a slight ravine (barely more than a hill), a small cabin came into view, tucked away between the trees where it was likely very hard to stumble across accidentally. A keen eye would notice the faintest shifts of movement in the growing shadows, where at least a couple individuals seemed to be mostly hidden as they kept watch--and whose attention turned on those approaching as they appeared.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Then there was silence. 

Skena was keeping a low profile, attempting to be the least eye-catching out of their group. Which was easy to do when the other two looked like colorful sunsets. About a minute passed, before she suddenly jolted a little, flinching and lifting a foot as she wobbled to the side, reflexively hissing a word in celestial that sounded like a curse.

A crossbow was immediately pressed into her back, and she kept her hands held up once she regained her balance. &quot;Sorry, sorry--I think an ant bit me or something. Can I just--can I go stand on the other side of him?&quot;

There was a pause, and then an untrusting grunt, and the crossbow bolt&#39;s tip moved away from her back again. Keeping her hands half-lifted, she daintily repositioned herself on the other side of her little group, and then fell silent again.

A few seconds passed... and then her voice came softly into Jaska&#39;s mind. <em>&#39;She&#39;s under this cabin; looks like a basement. I can only see her position relative to us, not details. I&#39;ll cough if she&#39;s moving...?&#39;</em> The last bit sounded uncertain, like she clearly wasn&#39;t sure if that was even helpful.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

While Skena did that and Luka subtly moved a finger and ducked his head to whisper under his breath, lips barely moving and hidden behind the fall of his wavy sunset hair, Jaska let out a heavy sigh, baring his teeth in irritation and lashing his tail, gesturing curtly with one arm. &quot;<em>Well?</em> What are you waiting for? You got your spore and you&#39;ve led the three of us here. Who do I have to speak to to get my sister back?&quot;

And yet, it lilted with her usual sunshine in a way that was so honey-sweet, it almost sounded a little unhinged; it would remind Luka of how she had sounded during the process of trapping Rhatihl.

<em>&#39;I am just fine, dearest, thank you. Take a deep breath, my love.&#39;</em>

The tabaxi hissed at Jaska. &quot;Pipe down,&quot; he snapped, not offering more than that in reply.

More minutes ticked by. At some point, Skena gave a tiny, polite little cough.

And then, finally, the cabin&#39;s door opened again, and a brutish-looking half-orc shouldered his way out, one hand reaching behind him to drag Valentine along as well by a rough grip on her upper arm. 

The tiefling&#39;s hands were still bound in interlocking leather gloves that prevented any manner of somatic gesture, and her staff was nowhere to be seen. But she wore a wide, wicked grin on her face, even beneath the smears of blood that poured from her nose, a split lip, a tear in her brow, and several dark shadows on her complexion that looked a bit more purple than usual--including in marks around her throat. 

And the half-orc himself did not seem to have escaped the encounter unaffected, either. Despite his intimidating figure and his role in these circumstances, he looked... more nervous than Luka. Practically on the verge of a panic attack. And there was a bit of blood under his nose, too. 

He pushed her forward ahead of himself, and she caught her balance with a swish of her tail, turning to face him slightly as she heard his footsteps; he was immediately turning to remove himself from the area. 

&quot;Ah-ah--&quot; She called after him, her tail curling in a rather lighthearted way. &quot;Now you know I&#39;m blind, it&#39;d be rude of you to not assist me back to <em>safety</em>,&quot; she purred, the word sounding solely amused, as if mocking the threat she was supposed to be under.

The half-orc tensed and stared back at her warily a moment, his breaths shallow, and his gaze repeatedly flicking up towards Jaska before returning to her. Perhaps out of some desire to not dig his grave any deeper than he already had, he did reluctantly step back over to her.

But before he could lay a hand on her again, she spoke up once more. &quot;In fact--I think you&#39;ll want to be on your knees for this, don&#39;t you?&quot; The words were so sweet and compassionate. And laced with an enchantment she had been holding on to for the right opportunity.

The man blinked. Then blinked again, looking a bit dazed for a moment. Then he... simply nodded, as if her request made all the sense in the world. &quot;... You&#39;re right,&quot; he mumbled, lowering himself down to his knees. 

As she heard him do so, Val gave him a wonderfully warm smile, and calmly stepped around him--not towards her brothers, but to stand behind the half-orc where he patiently knelt. She then, in no rush at all, delicately encircled his head in the loop of her arms created by her bound hands. And then <em>yanked</em> her arms back towards herself, using her restrained hands like a ligature crushing against his throat to begin to strangle him. She didn&#39;t expect to kill him herself, but she <em>did</em> expect to use the leverage to keep him pinned as long as she needed to.

As his airways were crushed, the enchantment snapped from him, and he flailed, fixing his hands around her own and trying to pull them away, his eyes wild with panic. 

&quot;Jaska, dear,&quot; Val called out in a silky purr. &quot;There&#39;s one on the roof who I&#39;m <em>sure</em> is aiming something at me.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Luka&#39;s expression had turned steely with rare fury at the condition Valentine was in, his fists clenching at his sides. Drawing in a shaking breath, as soon as the fighting began, he turned to the tabaxi and cast Crown of Madness upon him. A twisted crown of jagged iron appeared around his head, and the tabaxi&#39;s eyes glazed with insanity as a voice in his head compelled him to turn on his fellow guard.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But Luka&#39;s enchantment got to him first, and he stilled for a moment... and then turned abruptly to instead send the crossbow bolt through his companion&#39;s neck. Jolting at the blow, the half-orc&#39;s own weapon went off, the bolt narrowly missing Skena and burying itself into the ground instead. As he swayed on his feet, the tabaxi mindlessly loaded another bolt.

The man Val had a stranglehold on clenched his teeth, staring at Jaska with wide eyes that were almost disproportionately fearful of the situation. Val&#39;s grin remained as her arms strained to hold him in place, her stance only jostled once by an arrow that sank itself into the back of her shoulder, eliciting a (still grinning) hiss from her--but nothing else. 

No further shots came, as the individuals scattered around the premises one by one, in rapid succession, dropped dead and began to pour blood onto the surrounding terrain. By the time the half-orc with a crossbow bolt had dropped to the ground, the tabaxi, too, was picked off by a confusing blur of thin, black shadows moving too fast to properly comprehend, which enveloped him like a whirlwind and was gone just as quickly. 

Then the door to the cabin opened, and for the first time in an hour or two, a small, pale shape could be briefly glimpsed slipping inside, followed by that thin blur of black. From within the cabin came only a few sounds of shuffles. A few thumping sounds as heavy weight collapsed. And then silence.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Jogging forward towards Val, her hands illuminated with warm golden light as she began pouring healing magics into her, which Valentine patiently stood still for. &quot;Luka, darling, would you help me get these off?&quot; She asked as the magic worked, lifting her bound hands slightly.

The half-orc was clearly having a worst-case-scenario kind of day. He swallowed, his mouth feeling particularly dry, and a slight tremble to his hands as he held them up appeasingly. &quot;... A-Anthony Nuroc, sir...&quot; he managed weakly.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As her hands were freed, she flexed her fingers, her ring still very much there. She had been reassured of that when she had felt the little pings come in from her brothers as they, one by one, reached out to her to no avail. Skena&#39;s magic had taken away the worst of her injuries, easing back the bruising that had begun to form, and patching torn flesh back together, stopping any further bleeding--though what blood had already spilled remained on her skin, half-dried.

&quot;Thank you, dear. Your help is much appreciated,&quot; she offered the girl, before reaching, almost with a subconscious familiarity and habit, to loop a hand into the bend of Luka&#39;s arm, granting her a bit of guidance in surroundings she was wholly familiar with--and, consequentially, at her most blind in.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It suddenly occurred to him, the memory of his discussion with Skena, that she would back Achoris if things took a turn for the worst, and his eyes darted quickly to Skena, pinning her with a searching stare, watching her lips and her hands in particular. &quot;Luka, put the gloves on Skena,&quot; he hissed. &quot;Axa, if she attempts to cast a spell or get away, subdue her immediately.&quot;

Luka had frozen as well at the declaration, but sucked in a gasp at Jaska&#39;s demand. &quot;What?! No! She&#39;s--&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s already made it perfectly clear she&#39;d back her uncle if things escalated between us,&quot; Jaska said lowly, bristled up. &quot;She can be restrained peacefully, or she can be rendered unconscious, it&#39;s her choice.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And then shock again as she glanced up to find Jaska’s icy glare on <em>her</em>. 

“What? No, that’s impossible!” She snapped, her voice raised. “Achoris has been with Luka for the past two weeks nonstop, and then with me for the past two days! Between Luka and I, we can vouch for his activity for every second of that time! And he was too weak to do anything, anyways!”

She had taken a few steps towards the half-orc, reflexively wanting to shake him silly and demand where he got the audacity to throw around dangerous falsehoods like that—but she froze again as Axa suddenly appeared, covered in crimson stains, encircled by her knives hovering ominously behind her, her expression—oddly, somewhat lighter than it had been before—void of emotion with her eyes seeming a bit more red than usual, and pinned unblinkingly on Skena. The girl soundlessly inserted herself between Skena and Jaska, something off putting about her features.

Skena’s jaw clenched. She was silent a moment, taking in the uncharacteristic stares of Jaska and his daughter towards her, knowing they were matched by the sightless stare of Valentine at her back. Whatever hurt she would have felt was filed away for later, and she turned her gaze back towards Jaska, though she didn’t step closer. 

“I know you hate him and he hates you. But think about this critically for a moment. He has no magic that allows him to send messages telepathically, nothing that would permit him to orchestrate this while under constant surveillance. And that’s assuming he even would be willing to light this fuse, after the talks I’ve had with both of you that amounted to a mutual understanding that nothing needed to get this ugly over just disliking one another. He would never <em>put me in this position</em>, he wouldn’t freely let me accompany you on this outing if he knew I would be walking into something like this. <em>This doesn’t add up, Jaska.</em>”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Silence stretched between them. Then, abruptly, it was over, her eyes soft and clouded yellow again, her grip on him softened to give his cheek two firm pats. &quot;Very well done. Painless, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; She cooed, straightening and turning to Jaska.

Her head turned a fraction to address the two softies behind them. &quot;Where is your uncle <em>right now</em>, dear?&quot;

Skena didn&#39;t know if she should be wary of Valentine twisting information to suit this conspiratorial narrative, but was... giving things a chance to be investigated properly. She swallowed tightly as she was addressed. &quot;At home. I have no doubt of that--he was there when I left, Jaska <em>saw</em> him. <em>Spoke</em> to him. You can send a message to Kaleva and ask him to verify that if you need to; I have no reason to believe he would have gone anywhere else. He knew what I was headed out to do, and offered to be available to help if I needed it, so I can&#39;t imagine he would have then gone off to do something else.&quot;

Val hummed thoughtfully. &quot;How intriguing.&quot; Her head turned a fraction back towards Jaska. &quot;I believe this will get more confusing before it comes to a resolution. Are you willing to humor me a moment, my love? It may take a bit of time.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Once she&#39;d had Jaska&#39;s consent, she had simultaneously reached out with her telepathy--no longer stifled--to reach Achoris&#39; mind.

<em>&#39;Forgive me; I know you have no desire for these interactions with me. Your niece is unharmed, as is Luka. But we&#39;re facing a bit of a pickle. The surviving individual Jaska has singled out to interrogate, the same individual who has caused me harm over the last several hours, had your name on his lips when pressed for details of his superiors. Both Skena and Luka are adamant this is not possible. As I&#39;m sure you would suspect, Jaska is less inclined towards the benefit of the doubt. I, personally... have reason to believe you are likely innocent. But to prove that will unfortunately require your presence here.&#39;</em> A beat.

<em>&#39;I understand how this sounds, and what little trust I have earned to allow me such requests. If there is something I can do to put your mind at ease, I am willing to do what I can. This comes from me and not Skena solely because she is currently--harmlessly and voluntarily--restrained to prevent her spellcasting, as Jaska knows that if you were behind this, she would side with you, and sought that precaution for his own protection until this is resolved. If you would be comfortable in not coming alone, you are welcome to bring any companions or allies that would make doing so more palatable for you.&#39;</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

That matter concluded, she clasped her hands together. &quot;Right. Achoris is on his way, possibly accompanied by others for the sake of his comfort and cooperation.

The thought briefly occurred to him that he might as well be lining up a buffet for Achoris. And with that, he staggered off to be sick into a nearby bush.

A short while later, the sound of hooves and paws made their way up the road, Kaleva and Achoris on their hounds, and Ilex on a horse. Kaleva and Ilex were decked out in their full armor, and as Kaleva dismounted, he drew each of the blades over his arms to coat them in frost. Achoris cast his armor of Agathys and had his was scepter out and ready, his wings unfurling from his back and his halo of black sand like a crown around his head.

But with her hands still bound, clasped together in a way that robbed her of most of her spellcasting ability.

&quot;Thank you for coming,&quot; Valentine spoke. &quot;You can stay at a distance if you prefer. Your presence here is all I think we&#39;ll need to sort this out.

&quot;Very good, thank you darling.&quot; She nodded towards Luka. &quot;We need to go in, and down. There&#39;s a trap door, with some rotting wooden stairs leading to the lower floor.

Inside the cabin, the space was spartan at best, not looking like a home so much as, possibly, a bare-necessities shelter some hunter had put up or the like. Val moved carefully, unfamiliar with the environment, but was able to easily direct Luka to where she remembered the entrance to the lower floor being. She already knew how many steps there were, handling the creaking stairs well enough, and then stilling at the bottom, falling silent to listen. 

&quot;... Oh, good. He&#39;s still here.&quot;

The space on this floor was no more refined than the interior above had been, with crude, low-quality bricks and stones making up the walls, and rotting wooden boards covering the floor that creaked incessantly. The air here was musty and stagnant, and there was very little light--but enough for Luka&#39;s eyes to navigate without issue. Directly opposite them was one wooden door in the wall, the state of which matched that of the floorboards. And to their right was another. Like a small hallway, the likes of which seemed contradictory to the impression the ground floor gave of a hunter&#39;s respite. But who could say what it was originally built for.

&quot;... I was held there,&quot; Val hummed, pointing with her free hand to the door at their right. &quot;Do not go anywhere yet. What else is there in here, though?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I&#39;m going to stand right here a moment and ensure nothing happens that I do not want to happen. I need you and your lovely eyes to go in there,&quot; she murmured, gesturing to the door to their right where she had been held, &quot;and look around. I&#39;m quite certain it&#39;s unoccupied--but what we&#39;re looking for specifically is something small, handheld, that could be crushed in your hand to a sound like broken glass. Something that would hold an enchantment within it. You may see shards of one already broken, and that may help you determine what the intact ones would look like. I&#39;m not certain there are any intact ones leftover, but if there are, I want them.&quot;

Inside the indicated room, Luka would find it fairly barren. There were two decrepit chairs facing each other, with the only other &quot;furniture&quot; in the room being some dusty crates and barrels shoved into the corners. At the legs of one of the chairs was a length of rope, carelessly dropped to pool around itself. A keen eye would note the small traces of relatively fresh blood that had either dripped down from the chair&#39;s occupant, or been splashed into the nearby wall--but the quantity of blood itself was minimal (most of it had dried on Val&#39;s face or clothes).

The opposite chair had a leather belt hung off one corner of its back, a holster fashioned onto said belt that currently held a long hunting knife in its sheath, next to a row of two leather pouches held shut with brass buckles. Careful inspection would find, sure enough, tiny particles and shards of something vaguely resembling abalone shell spackling a small region of the floor closer to this chair.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A brief incantation to detect magic to confirm he hadn&#39;t missed anything and that the knife was not in fact magical, and he took the pearls back out to Valentine, taking her hand and depositing the pearls in them. &quot;There were shards around the chair you held, and these intact in a pouch on a belt laid over the other chair.

She delicately tucked the pearls into a pocket. &quot;That was the easy part. I have a hunch at what might be behind this door.

Once Luka was ready, she carefully moved forward, a hand extended until her fingers contacted the second door. Her touch glided over the rotting wood until she found the handle, and she smoothly pushed the door open.

It was dark inside, no source of light from within. That made no difference to her--and it affected Luka far less than it would someone who did not easily see in the dark. But still, Luka would only be able to make out the... <em>shape</em> of something. The mass of the creature seemed relatively humanoid, but the shape was all wrong--gangling and strangely-proportioned, currently postured in what seemed to be a forward hunch, spine curled forward in an almost gargoyle-esque way. As the door opened, and what little light had been out in the hall bled in, the figure looked up--and that small amount of light faintly gleamed off the glossy surface of two eyes, and entirely too many teeth, in an unnatural grin that stretched <em>entirely</em> too far.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And it <em>was</em> Achoris&#39; grin.

Luka, however, would likely notice something as he took better stock of this entity. Visually, yes, it was an effective replica of Achoris.

This creature had scarcely any signature on it at all--save for deep within its chest, where a heart would have been, having the tiniest pulse of... enchantment. 

The creature gave no reply, merely grinning and wheezing dry laughter. 

And then, unnaturally abruptly, it bolted directly at Luka, with every intention of shoving past him and darting from the room.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But Jaska was familiar enough with Kaleva to know he would exercise restraint, and he trusted in Valentine&#39;s prowess.

Luka darted forward to help Valentine in restraining the creature, and was just finishing tying its wrists when quick footsteps approached, and Kaleva now stood in the doorway, looking in on the scene with his hackles standing on end and his tail twitching.

Luka, hearing this, initially thought that Kaleva might have been a druid of some kind. He froze momentarily as he saw Kaleva&#39;s shift into his hybrid form, the lupine features and large ears, the black fur and wicked claws.  He opened his mouth, blinked, and tried again. &quot;Oh.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, don&#39;t spread it around, please,&quot; Kaleva muttered, his voice gone deep and gutteral as he went to help restrain the Achoris lookalike, shouldering in next to Valentine. &quot;I got him. You two go first.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Kaleva would have a fairly easy time wrangling the creature up the stairs after them and out into the yard in front of the cabin where everyone else still stood. The creature struggled the whole way, but its unsettling grin never faltered--and as its eyes landed on the actual man whose face it wore, those eyes (and grin) widened further, as if <em>thrilled</em> to see him.

And then its cackling fell away, and it spoke a single word; a word in celestial. One Achoris knew intimately, because it was the spoken component--the <em>only</em> component--of his <em>dimension door</em> spell.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Rather than be furious at having its escape foiled, the creature merely went back to cackling, this time even more hysterically. 

&quot;Someone gag this thing, pretty please,&quot; Val piped up. &quot;Unfortunately, I have nothing on hand that could assist there. But no need for it to try that again.&quot;

Skena stared at this new entity in blank shock and mild horror. &quot;... What the heck is <em>that</em>?&quot; She exclaimed--both deeply disturbed, and relieved that there seemed to be an alternative to her uncle being to blame here.

Valentine gently took Luka with her towards where Jaska was standing, her free hand fishing in her pocket and retrieving the two pearls. One of which she held out to Jaska. &quot;Tuck this away, dear. Save it for a rainy day.&quot; The other was handed to Luka. 

&quot;And I have no doubt Achoris does not want me facilitating this manner of magic around him. So would you be a dear and bring this over to him?&quot; She spoke clear and loud enough for all to hear her. &quot;When crushed, it will create a <em>zone of truth</em>. It has no adverse affects; it was used on me earlier. It will, however, provide a great deal of assurance to everyone present that everything spoken is honest, and that whatever this is, it was not orchestrated by Achoris himself.&quot; A beat. 

&quot;That is, of course, assuming that <em>is</em> the truth of the matter. And if that assumption is correct, I would suggest everyone voluntarily submit to the enchantment for the purpose of universal peace of mind.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And so he took the scarf from around his neck and stepped forward, folding it double as he went and giving it a quick twist to thicken it, then stepping up and effortlessly, with a move far too practiced, inserting it between the construct&#39;s teeth and knotting the scarf back behind its head.

A sharp shudder went through Achoris at the sight of it, and he worked his jaw and fought off a sudden urge to retch. He turned his attention to the pearl Valentine brought out, listening grimly as Luka brought the pearl over and placed it in his hand. &quot;Fine. Everyone huddle up.&quot;

Once the group was in the fifteen foot radius, Achoris dropped the pearl and crushed it under his boot to activate it. He felt the magic flow over him and didn&#39;t fight against it, speaking plainly. &quot;I had no knowledge of any of the events that led up to or transpired here. I had no involvement or intentions of orchestrating or participating in kidnapping, harming, or stealing from anyone present. I <em>would</em> like to know what the fuck this thing is and why it&#39;s impersonating me.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a construct of a sort,&quot; Luka piped up gently. &quot;There&#39;s enchantment magic at its core. It&#39;s not any sort of construct I&#39;ve dealt with, but there&#39;s enough similarities there.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As soon as Achoris concluded his stance, Skena quickly added her own.

&quot;Jaska, I have <em>no intention</em> of harming you in any way. At no time today or at any other point in my life have I ever desired to harm you, or expected I would have to regardless of desire. If you and Achoris <em>did</em> decide to go to war with each other, my involvement, my siding with him, would just be trying to protect him, help him escape, help <em>diffuse</em> the situation. I can&#39;t even comprehend of what it would take for me to react with skipping all of that and going straight for taking you out. No matter what happens, I will exhaust <em>every single other possibility</em> before resorting to attacking you,&quot; she pleaded, quiet but earnest, and her words now ringing with the enforced authenticity of truth.

&quot;... So can I <em>please</em> have these gloves taken off so I can help? I--If Luka&#39;s right, if this is a construct, <em>that&#39;s my life&#39;s work</em>. I studied all sorts of constructs before endeavoring to create my own. If I can go examine that... <em>thing</em>... I might be able to help everyone figure this out--and I also, while I&#39;m on the record here in this truth magic, have <em>no idea</em> what&#39;s going on, what that is, or where it came from--but... it&#39;s going to make that a lot harder without my magic.&quot;

She was standing next to Achoris and Luka and could have easily just gotten the gloves off with either of their help, but she was exclusively seeking Jaska&#39;s consent instead.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Trauma was very loud in the face of logic, though, and it still took a moment before he stepped up and removed the gloves from Skena&#39;s hands rather than offer any words in return.

She left the gloves with him (she sure as heck had no use for such things) and jogged over to where Kaleva was holding the bound and gagged maybe-construct. She looked it over a moment, her expression perfectly scholarly--but the chill that ran up her spine just as present, as the twisted and deranged-looking face of her uncle stared back at her with unblinking eyes. 

She hummed a faint note, and then spoke a word in celestial, golden light shimmering around her eyes. A moment of silence passed. 

&quot;... Well, it&#39;s not undead.&quot; She reached forward to lightly pinch the skin of its arm, tilting her head slightly in muted wonder. &quot;... But it... it feels completely... alive. So that would have been shocking. Not celestial, either... certainly not the way Achoris is.&quot; She squinted. 

&quot;... There&#39;s... something faintly <em>fey</em> about it, though. It&#39;s... such a faint signature. But it&#39;s there.&quot;

She fell silent again for a long moment. Then she looked to the werewolf holding it. &quot;I don&#39;t have any weapons on me. Could you poke it with something sharp? Not enough to kill, but not a papercut, either.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I&#39;ve... never seen a <em>construct</em> so convincing, either...&quot; And she was trying not to be envious of that.

Reaching up, her hand began glowing as she attempted to heal the wounds Kaleva had created. As the light faded again... 

Nothing had changed.

Her brows furrowed further, and she took a half step back to think. A long silence ensued, until she finally spoke up, sounding a little hesitant. &quot;... I don&#39;t suppose anyone here can read minds?&quot;

&quot;I can indeed,&quot; Valentine hummed. Before stepping out of the zone of truth, she paused a moment to turn her head towards Achoris. 

&quot;For what miserably little it&#39;s worth: I am sorry for how I harmed you. I have no intentions of ever repeating that offense. I am grateful for the happiness and love you showed to my brother, as I think we can both agree he is deserving of such things. Unless you do indeed decide to go to war with Jaska, you have nothing to fear from me--and I take no offense to you refusing to accept any apology from me. In your position, I&#39;m quite sure I wouldn&#39;t accept the other party&#39;s apology, either. And I thank you for humoring us here, despite how ironically threatening it sounded for me to make this specific request. I hope you can see now how your presence is instrumental in sorting this out, though. I was truthful when I told you I suspected you were innocent here, and at the time, I was aware that someone wearing your face was still inside this building. And the easiest way to prove it was not, in fact, yourself was to have both of you simultaneously present. So again: thank you for allowing me a measure of trust I did not deserve. I hope to never have to bother you with such requests again.&quot; A beat.

&quot;And simply because it seems to be the set precedent, I will also add in this zone of truth that I, too, have no idea what the hell that thing is.&quot; Not that anyone was implying she did, but just to cover bases in case Achoris somehow suspected her of framing him in her own kidnapping.

Turning then, she headed over to said thing, tilting her head contemplatively. Her eyes became drowned in inky blackness once more... and then narrowed slightly. It lasted only a few brief seconds, before she blinked the darkness away again. 

&quot;It&#39;s head is completely empty, Skena dear,&quot; she announced. &quot;Insects have more brain activity.&quot;

Skena&#39;s gaze had softened ever so slightly as Val gave her apology, only to warp to a deep contemplation at Val&#39;s input on the creature&#39;s mind. Or lack thereof.

&quot;... Huh.&quot;

Her gaze searched the ground thoughtfully, lips moving soundlessly as she sifted through her dense knowledge in this niche topic, searching for something that would make it make sense.

Finally, her head lifted again, squinting slightly as she glanced back towards everyone else. &quot;Any objections to it being destroyed? If it&#39;s mindless, I doubt an interrogation or anything of that nature would prove fruitful. But I could at least attempt to learn more through dissection. I&#39;m...

In an effort to expedite the process so it could just be over with, she reached forward to place a hand on the clone, pumping an obscene amount of necrotic magic into it. She knew Achoris was naturally resistant… so she went overboard, deceptively warm golden light shooting from her like needles and burying into the simulacrum. Immediately, tissues rotted and wilted, the body practically falling apart with rapid decay; with the damage Ilex and Kaleva had already done, her magic—despite his resistances—seemed sufficient to put an end to the process. 

While at first, it appeared the creature was falling apart from the rot, the body seemed to change drastically as it hit the ground, in ways Skena’s magic was not likely responsible for. When the entirety of its mass had dropped to the ground, it was in the form of… wet wooden branches, caked in mud. There were even some mushrooms and moss sprouted from various places in the wood.

Skena marveled at that a moment—deeply relieved the construct theory seemed correct, and she hadn’t just coldly murdered someone—before looking up again. “It’s safe to look now, Luka,” she murmured, before taking a step towards Kaleva and beginning to brush some moss and mud off his fur. He, more than anyone else present, would notice the drastic shift in the simulacrum’s scent, from a scent that was almost exactly that of Achoris’, to… well, it was like his senses had just been teleported to a swamp.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ilex was staring at the cluster of swamp that had been in the shape of his best friend, the tension draining from his body as he lowered the pick and rubbed at the back of his neck with a grimace.

Peeking up from Achoris&#39; arms, Luka blinked at the mess. &quot;That&#39;s... huh. I&#39;m - I thought there would be a. A body.

Looking up at Achoris, he blushed at the nearness of him and gently extracted himself with a bashful smile, the aasimar flashing him a gentle smirk before he approached the pile.

&quot;Wanna play fetch, Kaleva?&quot; he said jokingly, while searching the debris for any signs of his hair.

Achoris&#39; words snapped Kaleva out of it, and he let the stick drop from his mouth with a cough.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Val paused as Kaleva addressed her, looking like she hadn&#39;t expected the question from him. But her warm smile returned to her features promptly, the expression a little touched by his concern. &quot;I have an eldritch quasi-deity living in my head, who spends every moment of my life whispering horrors to me about threats and sadistic promises and attempts to undermine my confidence, none of which has ever succeeded in disturbing me.

Jaska massaged at his temples, closing his eyes. He was looking... more than a little frayed around the edges. But as Valentine gestured toward Anthony and mentioned him, he opened his eyes and looked over at him again. And his mortified expression. And the blood still on Valentine&#39;s skin, drying there.

Right. He turned to walk over to Anthony with that slow, predatory gait, his cat-like pupil barely a sliver in the burning crimson of his iris.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;See you around,&quot; Ilex said to Valentine as he turned to follow. Then walked a whole three steps before he blurted in elvish, &quot;<em>Tu viens de dire &#231;a &#224; une femme aveugle, cr&#233;tin absolu.</em>&quot;

Achoris couldn&#39;t speak elvish, but he understood the tone of Ilex putting his own foot in his mouth, and cackled under his breath.

Kaleva went to scoop up Skena and place her on Atreyu&#39;s back, following along at the dog&#39;s side as they went to make a quick exit.

With the non-family and Luka briskly evacuated, that left Valentine, Jaska, and Axa standing around the unfortunate half-orc, who now returned Jaska&#39;s stare with one of horror and rising panic.

The black blade punctured right through his eye socket and into his brain, snuffing out his life almost instantly. The life force poured into his body, filling it with vitality, and the surge of energy had him throwing the orc&#39;s body to the ground as he went to straddle it, slamming his dagger into his body over and over again with meaty thumps and growling breaths. But the neat puncture wounds weren&#39;t enough, so he started ripping the blade down, forcing his way through the ribs, into the stomach, blood splattering up over his arms, chest, and face, curls of hair falling free from the neat backsweep to hang over his snarling features.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There was a pause while Axa processed that, looking into the room--which, fortunately, did not have too much in it in the first place. &quot;... <em>Ja.</em>&quot;

Using the chalk she had summoned, she began drawing out a circle in the cleared space, not comprised of lines, but of strings of runes. As she had nearly closed the circle (which, despite her blindness, <em>was</em> a perfect circle in shape), she paused, having gotten to that point in only about a minute. 

&quot;When I complete this, we&#39;ll all need to run into this circle promptly.

At his confirmation, she finished the last strokes of the remaining rune, and all the runes illuminated in a gentle but steady glow of a warm, golden-orange color. She waited until Jaska and Axa had stepped through before following after them.

The sensation was unique. Not horribly nauseating, but a lurch of the gut nonetheless, a fleeting split-second of vertigo and total disorientation--before the world made sense again a mere instant later, and the three were standing in the unused side room in Val&#39;s home, atop an identical spell circle that had been embedded into the floorboards in what appeared to be golden inlays. 

&quot;There we are... All limbs accounted for?&quot; She hummed. 

Axa had looked a little stunned at first from the brief experience, but as the unusual sensations went away and she was slowly able to catch up to what had taken place... she suddenly looked like she was about to cry.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Out in the main room, Val finally set about cleaning off her own face, though she was sure there was blood she missed. She was content to let that wait until her brother and niece had their baths, though. As she cleaned up and started the process of baking the brownies, she reached out to Luka.

Jaska obligingly added bubble bath to the filling tub, and took a washcloth to wet down and start cleaning most of the blood from Axa so she wasn&#39;t going to marinade in her own filth. He briefly considered drawing a separate tub for himself after, but... he was tired. And Axa was tired. And who bloody cared. When the tub was full, he stripped down to his boxers and went to sit in the tub with her, taking a sponge and helping to scrub the blood out from under her nails, barely able to keep his eyes open as he yawned.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>&#39;Oh hush. I&#39;m coming back for you. You both did so much to come help me, I wouldn&#39;t be able to live with myself if I returned that selflessness with such disregard. Stay put,&#39;</em> she reiterated.

Extending her hand, there was a muted crackle of energy, and with a bit of effort... her staff reformed itself in her grasp, the eye&#39;s pupil darting around the room a moment before settling on her. 

<em>I&#39;ve had a hell of a day, so unfortunately for you--I&#39;m rather persistent about my needs at the moment.</em>

And she needed to draw directly from his power--because teleportation circles were not designed to go both ways. But what were silly rules like that to a god-like aberration of chaos?

Her hand gripping the staff blackened to an ichorous claw, the staff beginning to tremble slightly, as if what was within was straining to burst free. That inky darkness gradually consumed all of her, swirling around her, dripping from her form...

And then, with a muffled crack of a sound, she disappeared. 

Her nose stung as if water had been shot into her sinuses, but after the disorienting jolt, she found herself standing on rotting wooden floorboards again, something trickling from her nose. Panting ever so slightly, she scuffed the back of her fingers under her nose to wipe away the bleed, orienting herself in the cabin, before stepping back out again. &quot;Luka?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That was less magical orchestration and more eldritch bullying. This, however... This is reliable.&quot;

Finishing the last stroke of the rune, she beckoned him to step inside the circle that had begun to glow warmly with citrine light, the magic filling in the circumference of runes with intricate arcane geometry. &quot;In, in! Briskly, now!&quot; She urged lightly, and stepped in behind him after he had gone through.

Once again reappearing in her spare room, she took a deep breath, letting out a long sigh; that about tapped her for magic for the day--and she had been pushing the envelope greatly. &quot;There we are. All bits and pieces still attached?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Axa was not at all ignorant to their presence, but she looked just as exhausted as the rest of them, and seemingly past any point of potentially caring.

Val pursed her lips to keep from grinning, watching a moment more... before deciding not to tempt fate, and turning to quietly shoo Luka back out of the bathroom with her. &quot;Come,&quot; she whispered, &quot;Help me mix up this brownie batter while he&#39;s not conscious enough to care that you&#39;re here.

Shifting up with a slight groan, he reached over to unplug the stopper to start draining the water, taking the nozzle and turning it on to a drizzle so he could rinse the last of the dirty water from the both of them. &quot;Do you think you&#39;d be able to sleep here tonight so we don&#39;t have to make the journey home?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Valentine gradually came to, her head feeling fuzzy and strange. It had been a good decade or so since the last time she had ever fallen asleep, and so the sensations of regaining consciousness that had previously been stolen from her was mildly alarming. As soon as she had enough of her wits regained… all of her sharped to a dangerous edge.

She was seated in a chair. She couldn’t move her hands. She wasn’t alone; there were the idle shifting of one other body. Opposite her. The floor beneath her feet felt like wooden boards, but the air smelled faintly dank, stale. A finished (to some extent) room below ground level. She took inventory of all her extremities, noting everything of her body still felt intact. The amethyst she wore around her neck was naturally concealed under her weather-appropriate attire—not that it had the ability to assist her at the moment. She couldn’t tell if her ring remained on… she was having a hard time moving her fingers. Some minute shifting later, the faintest creak of leather finished the image in her mind; some sort of gloves on her hands, somehow of a design that anchored her fingertips in place where her hands had been positioned to clasp, fingers neatly laced together. Like a straight jacket. 

She waited until her mind was clear enough for her to have her confidence back before making any larger movements. And so when she did, it was a smooth, gentle straightening of her back and lifting of her head, a deep breath being drawn in as she cast a very cordial smile towards the sound of breathing. 

“… If you have a monologue, you may proceed with it,” she said, her voice it’s usual warm self. 

Her company did not answer immediately, and she could all but feel the blank look on their face. Then the voice of a gruff male.

“Sorry to disappoint, sugartits.” The sound of weight shifting on a second chair, then lifting from it. Two unhurried steps in her direction.

“You’re the one who needs to do the talkin’. Here’s how this is gonna work.”

Val had good ears; she knew the subtle sound of a dagger being drawn from a leather sheath.

“I’m gonna ask a question. You’re gonna give me an answer. The right answer. Every time you don’t… we’re gonna choose little pieces of you to carve off and scatter in the woods like bread crumbs for your brother to find.”

Val, of course, was unfazed. “Ah, I see,” she said with a nod. “Well, I <em>have</em> been thinking about taking some length off my ears… but you know, I’ll handle that on my own time, no need to cause a fuss for a gentleman such as yourself. I’d like to propose a counter-offer,” she went on silkily. “And I think you’ll find my terms very agreeable, so do hear me out; I have one single question I wish to ask of <em>you</em>. In exchange, I will tell you all of Jaska’s deepest, darkest secrets. If you have the means and the desire, I will submit to divination magics that can confirm the truthfulness of what I have to say. And I consider myself a fair and charitable woman—I will even give you those secrets first, so long as we do have a deal, and I will have my question answered at the end. Furthermore,” she went on, with the same hospitable warmth as that which she sold inn rooms with, “I can sweeten the deal even more. You may place any hard limits on what my question may contain. For instance, if you are worried I intend to ask sensitive information about yourself or your companions or even where I am currently being held, you may prohibit me from doing so, and I can ensure my singular question does not infringe on these terms.” She smiled with all the sunshine she always had, her tail swaying very casually and relaxed over the floor. “Do we have a deal?” </span> <span class=chatlog__reply-edited-timestamp title="Saturday, January 14, 2023 2:30 AM">(edited)</span></div></div><div class=chatlog__header><span class=chatlog__author style=color:rgb(192,106,155) title=daarka data-user-id=164583493953650688>Daarka</span> <span class=chatlog__timestamp title="Monday, January 23, 2023 10:51 PM"><a href=#chatlog__message-container-1067335841741025301>1/23/2023 10:51 PM</a></span></div><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Val chuckled. &quot;Oh, I certainly did.

She held her hand palm-up, and atop its surface, a spiral of inky black thread began to apparate. When it had formed in its entirety, she murmured, &quot;Relax, and it should play out for you as if you had been in my skin the whole time.&quot; A beat. &quot;It may help to close your eyes... unfortunately, this comes without visuals.&quot;

At that, a deft flick of her finger launched the ethereal thread through the air, where it splashed without a sensation over Jaska&#39;s forehead. And in his mind&#39;s eye, her crisp and pristine memory began, from the moment she had regained consciousness... to after she had finished speaking, and the half-orc, after a nauseating silence, had seemingly decided the course of action he felt most appropriate in reply was to clock her in the face hard enough to make her head swim.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

If the man had a drop of the arcane in him, he wouldn&#39;t have needed to rely on those pearls to cast magic for him, and wouldn&#39;t have resorted to a primitive dagger--no offense--as a means of threat. Besides, we were never interrupted by a third party, poking in to see what he had learned. So their letter was, undoubtedly, a bluff; I don&#39;t think they realized the claims were true. Besides, didn&#39;t someone mention something about the simulacrum having penned it ahead of time?&quot; She shrugged.

&quot;I did not fully know the plan of theirs at the time, but in hindsight, it was likely to try to press me for whatever I would spill without any inkling I would be handed back over to you two to amplify their chances of that being fruitful, and ransom me simultaneously. Poorly thought out, really; absolutely no guarantee I would have shared anything of use to them, so they were wholly relying on what they could squeeze out of you, with my secrets being a potential side dish.&quot; She paused, before tilting her head at him.

&quot;While your beginnings were objectively the harshest, Luka and I didn&#39;t exactly start off super cozy. Neither of us have memories of our parents; the earliest memories were of the orphanage. Twins who could not be separated, with one of them being permanently handicapped, were not exactly a hot commodity for those looking to adopt. Couples usually came to the orphanage with a single child in mind--when they came at all--and two, plus the special needs, was like the work required for raising <em>three</em> children instead. We were never adopted. But in the very early years, I think we were also both terribly shy. Me moreso than him, if you can believe it. We never really connected with any of the other kids... I remember how jarring it was to try to play with them, because of course, kids under a certain age simply don&#39;t have the capacity to really understand what it means to be blind. What accommodations should be made in interactions. What my limitations were. That lack of understanding led to conflict at best, outright bullying at worst. But Luka always innately understood what I needed, and how to interact with me. Even as little toddlers. It was like he came out of the womb with an understanding of blindness.&quot;

She shrugged a little. &quot;In any case. We ended up off by ourselves more often than not. From a very early age, we were all each other had. And every time we found ourselves estranged from those around us, it just made the bond between us even tighter. Some things were easier to endure than others, of course. One of those <em>others</em> being certain holidays that put an emphasis on social bonds. Winter&#39;s Crest, the harvest feasts, new year&#39;s celebrations... and, of course, Valentine&#39;s day. A day meant to celebrate those who filled your heart. The orphanage would often try to do quaint little festivities for the kids, and for Valentine&#39;s day, that often involved writing each other cards or drawing pictures for one another, and delivering them to our friends. But Luka and I had become so disconnected from the rest of the kids that we never really formed bonds with any of them. So one year, Luka decided to see that as a celebration of our bond, instead of an isolation from others. He started calling me Valentine--<em>Val</em> was already my nickname--and it just... stuck. What began as the silly titles dubbed by five year olds just stuck. I remember those early years of hearing him address me with it, and how it filled my heart with a feeling of being celebrated. Of being loved. Of having a place I belonged.&quot;

Her hand shifted to lightly pinch his jaw between her thumb and the curl of her forefinger. &quot;That has always been the foundation of this family. That the rest of the world be damned; we have each other.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Certainly no genetic predispositions from the Piotovich bloodline. And from what I understand, your first sexual experiences were in Luka&#39;s body, likely done as a means of spiting him. So from your earliest years, sex was a part of your coping mechanisms. A part of letting out your frustrations and rage and hurt. It was an act of vengeance and validation and being heard. All experiences Luka and I do not share, but certainly experiences that made sex more commonplace for you, and less taboo.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
