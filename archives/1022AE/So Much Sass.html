Jaska leaned against the wall outside the Creeping Root Inn, one boot hiked up to prop against the wall behind him while he smoked a cigarette, the smell of cloves wafting around the tiefling. His clothing had a casual finery to it, a nice button-up shirt with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows and unbuttoned to his collarbones, a waistcoat worn over the top. Neat slacks tucked into soft leather boots, and he had a knife sheath at his thigh and another tucked in the back of one boot. His split tail flicked absently, seeming to have a mind of its own.

Once he&#39;d finished the cigarette, he dropped it to the ground and snuffed it out with his heel, turning to head into the tavern.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I told you, no shortcuts. I hate the way this alley smells...&quot; The complaint was not far off, and from a relatively short figure drifting off of the main street. A possibly familiar figure lead her. Dog wore no harness, it was true but it was clear he made the little figures path easier as her hand was outstretched and twined in his fur. Her clothing was oversized. The duster she wore had earned its name and one shoulder barely stayed and casually open to reveal a tunic top underneath. It was cut to the midriff but sloppily. Suspenders and a hempen belt kept her pinstripe slacks around her hips and the peak of copper pins would tell anyone how she kept hem from dragging behind her boots. Hobo chic, with fluffy hair bouncing and eyes squinting in Jaska&#39;s direction. There was only a fraction of surprise and not a ton of recognition.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And by that time Piper seemed to blink with an impressed inkling that the blur had seemed very sharp and liquid. Carefully, she followed Jaska. Since she could take her time here she was careful to place one foot out to test any steps. One trip was not enough to keep her comfortable yet. Especially as the light changed. A silent count clicked in her mind as she tried to let the light change first* 

&quot;What a surprise! Beasts are allowed in after all. Dog might even be tall enough to take a seat, too.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Despite the rigid body language, it seemed Dog was still zeroed on him until Piper clicked her tongue following the very loud glass hitting the very hard table. 

He plodded to his human. Thankfully no seat on the stool, but still stretching his long back leggies out.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She also was not dressed in her usual, almost dense layers--though the dress she did wear still obscured just as much of her body as her usual attire did.

Threats to turn Dog into a coat aside, he at least didn&#39;t seem angry enough to escalate things into violence. He&#39;d stabbed people for getting on his nerves before, sure, but Piper wasn&#39;t even on the radar of being a threat.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Okay. So...I am more annoying than a dog...&quot; She offered quietly, the tip of her boot absently tapping Dog&#39;s shoulder as she started to process. 

Cass was not entirely forgotten, Piper still had her head tilted towards her and hoping for an answer but there were cogs turning here. 

&quot;And he would probably be a better conversationalist...But somehow you are still talking to me. What does that mean for you?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;The only conclusion I am coming to is that I must be <em>extremely bored.</em> And therefore itching for antagonism.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His sinuous tail slid around, subtle and silent, to attempt to wrap the tips around two of the legs of her stool, and gave a sudden jostle - enough to make her balance precarious the way she was leaning back, but not enough to topple the stool.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was only Jaska&#39;s mercy to shake it that allowed her to remain on the stool itself but her cool demeanor slid right off along with her pride. She was not aware of the cause, only having her own hubris to blame. She gripped the bar top after and cleared her throat. 

&quot;I didn&#39;t say it was a compliment...&quot; Piper muttered. For a moment, though, her attitude was snapped.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
