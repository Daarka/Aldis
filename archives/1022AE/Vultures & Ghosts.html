As Nils stepped outside of the inn, it wouldn&#39;t take him long to notice something, as it had been something he&#39;d been intently looking for all along: a vulture, perched on a rooftop opposite where he stood. And not the turkey vultures native to this climate, but a lammergeier. It was looking directly at him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

So when he saw the lammergeier looking right at him, his breath caught in his throat, feeling goosebumps rising all up along his arms. &quot;Where is she?&quot; he choked out, stepping forward and looking up at it. He quickly looked around the area as well to see if she was nearby.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Then, it seemed to make some sort of conclusion. 

Spreading its wings, it took flight from the gable it had been perched upon, flying lazily off over the buildings. 

If Nils followed, he would find the vulture headed for the edge of town. Eventually, the buildings became sparse, and then nonexistent, and he was moving through the trees in the dying light of the evening, occasionally following small foot trails, but otherwise having left civilization behind him.

The shadows only grew longer, and the trees were tall enough to occasionally block Nils&#39; sight of the vulture. At some point, he lost track of the bird altogether. Several long moments would pass with no sign of it, the anxiety creeping into his mind that he had lost it entirely... and then there was a soft voice, hauntingly familiar, just off in the distance.

&quot;Oh, there you are, Ven. Trouble using a portal?&quot; Cassiana had been midway back towards her shared residence with Hiraeth, but had paused amidst the trees as the familiar vulture landed nearby, unhurriedly reaching to free a dead rabbit from her person to toss it his way. 

&quot;Not to worry. You would have hated the swamp.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

When he lost sight of it, he sped up in the direction he&#39;d seen it disappear toward, and was about to cry out for it when the sound of Eidunn&#39;s voice came through the forest, and it was enough to bring him to his knees, sucking in a quavering breath.

How long had he longed to hear her voice again? The familiar cadence of her speech, her tone. He braced himself against the ground, forcing his traitorous legs to straighten once more, his breath and his voice caught in his throat as he staggered into sight.

Having just come from his shift, he hadn&#39;t been wearing his armor, or shield. Only his axe hung from his belt. He wore a pale gray-white tunic with blue designs around the hems, laced up the v-neck, and worn navy blue breeches tucked into fur-lined boots. His hair had been washed and freshly brushed and braided. But the look on his face was so full of desperate longing, hope, and heartache, and the moment he saw Cassiana, he whispered, &quot;<em>Eidunn.</em>&quot; Like a prayer. Like an outlandish, far-fetched prayer that could not possibly be true but was true nonetheless.

And no matter her damaged appearance, he moved quickly toward her to take her into his arms, and let out a single, broken wail into her shoulder.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But there was recognition there. Enough for her to put up no resistance to his embrace, too stunned and caught off guard to do much of anything. Just maybe not the degree of recognition he would have expected.

As the vulture snatched up his offering, Cass dazedly tried to grapple with this man&#39;s existence, finding herself completely unsure of what to do from inside his arms... but suddenly gripped with a splitting headache. He smelled like pine needles. 

&quot;... You... You lay beside me...&quot; she managed, the words a bit strangled and bewildered, even as a trickle of blood slowly ran from one side of her nose.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But that hopeful part of him misinterpreted her words as confusion as to why he was alive, and he clarified in a whisper, &quot;We&#39;ve both been brought back...

She managed to maintain that same air of soft, elven regality--but her left side looked appropriately chewed up, deep, thick scars knotting over what could be seen of her complexion. Her lower half seemed fine, despite the apparent need to walk with a staff, but the spectral prosthetic acting as her left hand was new. And something was... just slightly off about her left eye. The color wasn&#39;t exactly right, and it didn&#39;t move exactly as it should have.

As Nils pulled back to look her in the face, she returned his gaze, studying his face with... a quietly pained look. Her head felt like it was splitting open, her eyelids occasionally fluttering from the sudden pain, but more than that... the look on his face... it hurt her even more, and she didn&#39;t know why. 

Despite the way it made the world around her spin slightly, she studied his features. His unique horns, the braids in his hair, the scar across his nose--the much more prominent scar across his neck... the torc sitting atop his collarbone, which perfectly matched the one she, also, had around her neck.

His arms around her would feel the way her body became a little unsteady, as if she might sway precariously had he not been wrapped around her. She seemed speechless for a long moment; when she did try to speak again, it was... choked. Strained.

&quot;... N... N--?&quot; It wasn&#39;t on the tip of her tongue. It was well hidden, somewhere, and she didn&#39;t know where to reach for it. Did his name begin with an N? That was her reflex, but... she didn&#39;t know what came after that.

...She couldn&#39;t remember his name.

He saw how her eyes searched him, lingered on the torc that was a perfect match of hers. He saw the way her eyelids fluttered, the pain she was clearly feeling. Physical, not emotional. And he realized that she only recognized him as the body she woke up next to, and not... <em>him.</em>

The words on his tongue felt like vomit when they finally spilled past his lips. &quot;...You don&#39;t know who I am, do you?&quot; And with those words, he just seemed to... break. The dim glow in his eyes fading as all that painful hope quietly shattered and left him berefit.

&quot;W-- Wait, no, don&#39;t... P-Please don&#39;t cry,&quot; she choked, uncharacteristically strangled by the words. &quot;I--&quot;

... It had been so much easier to be unbothered by her origins up to a minute prior. Her mind swam--not just from the headache, but from the psychological tsunami that was suddenly upon her. Her good hand clinging to her staff for stability, her smoky one lifted to seemingly rub at her forehead, healing magics in the form of spilling smoke seeping into her body until the blood no longer ran.

Sucking in a deep breath as the physical pain softened, at least for the time being, she reached that incorporeal hand out again, this time to attempt to place its palm on the man&#39;s chest. 

&quot;... Please don&#39;t cry,&quot; she whispered again, hoarsely. &quot;I... I can&#39;t bear it. I...&quot; She stalled a moment, searching for the words. How could she explain what she didn&#39;t understand?

&quot;I don&#39;t... I don&#39;t know what I remember. I--I thought I remembered nothing at all, but... the... you smell like...&quot; she paused, wincing slightly as the pain in her head began to rise a little again. 

&quot;... Ignorance has been bliss,&quot; she managed after a moment, &quot;But there can be no bliss beyond the look on your face. I... Nothing I can remember has... has hurt me as much as this look on your face. Please, I&#39;ll... I&#39;ll try to remember,&quot; she choked. &quot;I-I&#39;m sorry.

His nails dug into the scarring that raked up his forearm, remnants of the teeth that had ripped Eidunn&#39;s arm off.

Tonight needed to just be for them.

Nils nodded, dragging his eyes open. &quot;I&#39;ve been working at the Creeping Root Inn until you returned... I&#39;ll ask Valentine for a room.&quot; The idea of leaving her again felt like it would tear his heart right out, and an irrational part of him was absolutely petrified she&#39;d disappear from his life again. He sucked at his lower lip ring - and if Cassiana still had her other ring in place, she might recognize its identical design.

But he searched her face, and found no sign of what he feared. He didn&#39;t see any desire to run or to get away from him, to try to escape what must have been a very unsettling encounter.

And in the end, even now, without her memories, he trusted her.

Strapped to it was a familiar shield.

With the bag slung over her shoulder again, she started off in the direction she had originally been going in, glancing to Nils as if to reflexively confirm he was coming with her. 

The woman Nils remembered could run circles around him. This woman moved slow—steady, but slow enough that Nils’ own pace was somewhat unnaturally reined in to match.

When she reached the familiar little cottage, she pushed her way inside, looking around to see if Hiraeth was home.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The cottage was clean, fresh herbs hung to dry in the kitchen, and it looked as though he&#39;d even done a bit of foraging while Cass was gone, as there was a new addition to the decor - a deer skull, scrubbed clean and hung over the fireplace.

He looked up as she entered, smiling and nudging his glasses further up his nose. &quot;Welcome back, Cass. How&#39;d the trip go?&quot; Looking past her to the other tiefling that was following her, he gave the unfamiliar man an easygoing nod of greeting, to which Nils hesitantly returned.

Nils couldn&#39;t help but wonder, as he glanced around the very tiny cottage, if they were an item. After all, Eidunn didn&#39;t remember him... He could hardly hold her to a vow she had no memory of.

And death, for a time, did do them part.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;There was no fire. I have no memory of my past. I had a life, once, and then I died. I cannot say why I am not currently rotting in the ground, but by all accounts, I should be.

Though after that consideration, he gave her a small smile. &quot;I&#39;m not adverse to it, no. And I thank you for the truth, though it was never required of you.&quot; He went back to chopping the mushrooms, finding the faint squeaking sound of the blade cutting through the fungus to be rather soothing. &quot;It&#39;s your history, Cass, and has zero impact on me.

&quot;I&#39;m spending the night elsewhere tonight,&quot; she added softly, reaching into her bag to pull out a bundle of linen. &quot;These may be of interest to you, however.&quot; She hobbled over, setting the bundle on the counter beside him, within which was a colorful collection of mushrooms from the marsh. &quot;I cannot identify all of them, so do not presume them to all be edible. But I may be able to assist with making something useful even out of ones that may be toxic.&quot;

From there, she rummaged around a moment more, producing a spare change of clean clothes from her small collection of belongings in Hiraeth&#39;s home, and tucking them into her bag. &quot;... I am not sure what the next several days will look like for me. But I should still be in town. So I will speak to you again soon,&quot; she murmured, carefully shrugging her bag back over her shoulder--shield still attached.

They were always very important birds to you. And every time I saw a vulture after I had awakened, it always flew south. Without fail. It took some time for me to notice this trend, but once I did, I had the feeling you were no longer in Holbrook, and began following any vulture I saw. I&#39;ve been searching for you for perhaps a dozen seasons now.&quot;

Nils tipped his head back slightly. &quot;A few days ago, I encountered an old friend of ours, a shifter named Cha Cha. Much older now... We&#39;d been dead for about thirty years, and he was more than a little disturbed to see me. But we spoke, and I told him of my search for you, and he invited me to come with him to Fielbarry, where he was hoping to find a safe haven for some people he was smuggling out of Holbrook, and also to join the guild there. It was suggested I ask the bartender at the inn whether or not she knew of anyone bearing your name or likeness, and I was told you were indeed here, but out on a mission. So I waited, and when I got off of work today, your vulture was waiting outside for me, and led me to you.&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, May 27, 2022 11:05 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Cass listened, soaking in this information quietly. &quot;Mm... Valentine, yes. I&#39;ve become quite acquainted with her and her brothers...&quot; she drifted off, wondering at the life she had lost. Information Nils undoubtedly carried. Wondering if she would regret sharing that knowledge, if she would invite a burden she had been blissfully absent of thus far.

But... it was as she said; ignorance was not blissful when it caused such pain. And... she <em>did</em> want to remember. She wouldn&#39;t have thought she would have any desire to remember, but this man struck such a deep, lost part of her that she couldn&#39;t help but want to know the entirety of that sensation. 

And he clearly loved her. Surely nothing he would have to say could burden her so much as to drown out the blessing of someone with a good heart, wanting to share that heart with her. 

&quot;... Thirty years,&quot; she finally echoed. A pause, before she looked over at him, a small, but wry smile touching her lips. &quot;Am I as you remember me, then? I don&#39;t suppose the dead age...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Nils paused, turning to her for a moment. &quot;Er... may I...?&quot; he gestured toward her nose where there was  still some blood smeared there. &quot;Valentine was very concerned about me having been a possible abuser you escaped from, and it&#39;s probably better for my health if you... don&#39;t look like you got punched in the nose.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

With her good hand still on her staff, her incorporeal one lifted to rest over the back of his hand on her face, almost creating no sensation at all on his skin, save for a faint, shapeless pressure.

Cass shook her head dismissively. &quot;I wasn&#39;t exaggerating earlier, Nils. I have over a thousand gold to my name. The guild is beyond lucrative. It couldn&#39;t be less of a trouble to me.&quot; She had handed the key off to the person with multiple functioning fine manipulators, and waited for him to unlock and open the door to the room once they were up the stairs (a bit of an awkward process for Cass, but she seemed unbothered with it). 

It was certainly one of the nicer rooms in the inn, but one could only hope for as much when one paid over one hundred percent as a tip. There was a comfortable looking king-sized bed, a loveseat, a table fitted with two dinning chairs, and a countertop with an aether-powered, miniature stovetop, with a similarly petite icebox nearby. A small bathroom space came in the form of a closet-like sub-room, separated from the main space with a door, though a larger bathing area was not behind said door, but adjacent to it, with a decently sized tub equipped with a faucet (magically-powered running water was a blessing), with a pretty folding screen modestly shielding the space from the rest of the room. 

Looking around with absentminded curiosity, Cass hobbled forward to rest her things down, letting out a soft, appreciative grunt as she was finally able to stand and move around without a bag of belongings tugging at her. 

&quot;If we are married, then I hope you do not mind a bit of immodesty,&quot; she announced after a moment taken to stretch, rolling her shoulders back. &quot;I feel like I&#39;ve been steeping in bog water for weeks...&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, May 27, 2022 4:25 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Cass smiled softly at him. &quot;You have done nothing to make me uncomfortable,&quot; she reassured, carefully shifting her weight as she propped her staff on the side of the mattress, freeing her hand(s) to begin peeling off her outermost layers and pouches. 

&quot;You... Your touch does not feel like that of a stranger. I can&#39;t explain it. There is no sense of violation when you are within my personal space or laying your hands on me.

Cass shrugged off her shawl-like wrappings, neatly folding them aside on the end of the bed. &quot;... Quite a lot, I suppose,&quot; she murmured after a moment&#39;s thought, untying the various things holding her clothes to her body, alternating her good hand and, when it couldn&#39;t reach, her spectral one. 

&quot;I&#39;m... not even sure where to start...&quot; She continued to unhurriedly strip, until she was down to a long-sleeved dress, with its left sleeve hemmed halfway up her forearm. Most of her outer wrappings had covered up the skin that this dress did not, and with them gone, the collar of the dress more loosely exposed parts of her shoulders and upper chest. Even just a few inches more of visibility, and the nasty scarring was immediately apparent, angry, jagged lines in an upward direction on her left side. 

&quot;... Perhaps... we should start from where we are now. Work our way back until we reach the beginning,&quot; she mused, pivoting to half-sit back on the edge of the mattress so she could bend her right leg up and unlace her boot. &quot;Maybe things will fall into place for me along the way.

It didn&#39;t even matter if he was wrong, it slightly riled Val up and that amused him.

Nils reached down to unlace his boots, tugging them off and setting them aside so he could sit cross-legged on the bed. &quot;I woke up a little over three years ago. You were gone. But not in the way I&#39;d expected... There were no remnants of you. Your sword, your shield, your clothing, your jewelry was all missing. And I still had all of mine. So it didn&#39;t make sense that just your body would have been ransacked and not mine. At first I thought maybe your clan might have taken your body - but given what you&#39;d told me of them and of the ways of shadar-kai, I thought it unlikely they&#39;d care about your remains. You&#39;d left them so long ago. And then, faced with the strangeness of my own reawakening, I could only come to the conclusion that you&#39;d been resurrected as well. So I began to search for you.&quot;

He thumbed over one of the runes on his forearm, the rune of haglaz, or hail. The rune of trials and hardship faced. &quot;I traveled all throughout Holbrook. To every shelter you&#39;d made, to the ones we made together. Most worn down and taken back by nature, given the three decades they&#39;d been left mostly untouched. I searched the old haunts, places we&#39;d been. And when I finally began to notice the direction the vultures were guiding me, I started to travel south, and kept my eyes to the sky. I did very little else during that time. I hunted as I needed to, I sheltered when I needed to, but there was very little living involved. I had one purpose, and that was to find you.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Cass unlaced her boot and carefully slid it off, though... the other one remained on, which she treated as normal, as she straightened out her leg again, glancing over to him. &quot;Mm... I don&#39;t have--&quot; she paused, her eye catching the motion of his thumb, the markings it ran over.

&quot;You have them, too,&quot; she exclaimed softly, leaning forward to look at the runes on his hand with interest. &quot;What do these mean? I-- Oh.&quot;

She had pushed her own hand forward, palm down, to show the loosely-matching runes on the back of her intact hand, in the same position, and of the same quantity, but in white ink that stood out against the smoggy gradient of her complexion. But she paused when she looked at her own, noting for the first time that a rune had appeared that she had not previously accounted for. At the end of the row was the rune ehwaz, and with a glance back and forth, she noticed that Nils had the same ᛖ at the end of his row as well--identical, save for his being in black ink.

&quot;... A new one has appeared... recently, I believe. I don&#39;t remember that being there earlier.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It opened your eyes beyond the stale and spartan lifestyle and thinking of your people, and you wanted to see more, experience more.&quot;

His touch slid down to the second rune, tracing it over her skin. &quot;This is dagaz, the dawn. It represents new beginnings and the transformative powers of change. It&#39;s a symbol of hope, certainty, and security. We thought this symbol best represented our joining in marriage, both for the meaning behind the rune, and the symbolism between the two of us. Dawn was the middle stage between the sun, of which I represented, and the moon, which you took after.&quot;

The third was lightly tapped upon. &quot;This is thurisaz, Thor&#39;s hammer. It symbolizes a powerful force of energy, either destruction or defiance, usually included with conflict. Our work with the Flamekeepers was to dismantle the prejudiced ways of life for the people in Holbrook, to try to create a place where people like myself and my family could live in peace and without fear.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The yew, or ash tree, Yggdrasil, represents the Tree of Life. It represents the dying of an old way of being, the end of an era in your life. It also represents divine protection, wisdom, a sense of purpose. The connection between all the worlds.&quot;

Holding his wrist against hers, he murmured, &quot;Mine is hagalaz, hail. Destruction, sudden and cataclysmic change. It&#39;s unavoidable and out of our hands, but just how destructive it ends up being is dependent on whether or not we&#39;re able to weather the storm with grace.&quot;

He then focused on the fifth, identical runes, and he seemed to lose some of the melancholy and smiled. &quot;And this is ehwaz, the horse. It represents moving forward and changing for the better with gradual and steady progress. It shows teamwork, trust, and loyalty.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It wasn&#39;t painless, either. You suffered for several minutes before you died.&quot;

Nils worked at his lip piercing, clicking it lightly against his teeth. &quot;I tried to go on after you died, for the sake of my family and our friends. I was told that the pain would lessen in time, that I would find a reason to live again. But it only got worse with each passing day. My sleep was haunted by visions of your death. I had no appetite and could not swallow whatever I put in my mouth. By the time I came to the decision to put an end to it, I could barely walk back to the place I&#39;d lain you to rest.&quot;

He didn&#39;t need to explain the rest. She might even remember his corpse, the knife in his hand and the gaping wound across his jugular, the rains and snow having long since washed away the blood, but the strange magic having preserved the state of his body. He&#39;d been laying on his side, facing her, his other hand resting upon hers and his pale, lightless eyes barely open.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Though knowing the pain her death left behind... that was sobering. 

Her good hand lifted to gently run her fingers over the scar on the side of his neck, her expression softly touched with a look like regret.

&quot;... Then I was not like this in life,&quot; she concluded softly. &quot;I have wondered that. If the marks I carry--and the pieces I do not--were the remnants of my death, or of some incident during my life.&quot; She paused.

One of the wait staff had brought up their food, and she stepped aside to allow them in enough for them to set the plates down on the table, with Cass offering a word of thanks before they wished them a goodnight and dipped back out.

It appeared the meal for the evening was gently steaming spaghetti, with marinara sauce on the side, as well as a bowl of parmesan cheese, and yet another side of similarly steaming meatballs that smelled divine. Lastly, there was what looked like a freshly baked loaf of bread, a tray of butter, and a jug of ice water.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She leaned forward from there, precariously holding herself over their meal, to press her lips to the center of the mess he had created.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I would very much like to keep that particular detail an unknown. Fielbarry seems wonderfully accepting of all creeds--but I don&#39;t endeavor to push that luck.&quot; She shrugged a little.

&quot;Besides, less time wasted on people gawking or questioning. But you will probably be pleased to know that much of my magic is of a breed to counter the abilities of the undead--and I&#39;ve found it to have no effect on myself. So I doubt we will find ourselves subjected to turning magic or the like. Still...&quot;

She reached out her good hand, fixing it on her staff to pull it upright. &quot;Magic that is designed to detect the presence of undead... that <em>will</em> locate us.&quot; As she spoke, the muted, eerie blue glow of light that came from within the lantern at the top of her staff drained itself of color, instead giving off a dull grey glow as smoke lightly spilled from its confines, licking up the hood of the lantern and dissipating into the air. 

&quot;I have managed to manipulate this particular tool so it excludes myself from its detection. I will try to have it exclude you as well, but I cannot guarantee that will be successful. Fortunately, it is not overt about what this indicator means.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In your culture, vultures were vessels through which the dead are taken to a more pleasant afterlife. So, what becomes of the dead kind of has to do with who eats them, and what is eaten. With the head and the brain being the seat of the mind, you never want to consume those parts because they can bring madness. But if you want to make sure that your enemies never reach the afterlife, you bury the head so the vultures can&#39;t eat them. What happens to the rest of the body doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;

He gestured to her. &quot;That&#39;s where you come in. What you eat of the rest of the body is supposed to grant you different strengths. Muscles for energy and strength, flesh for protection, stomach for wellness, lungs for endurance and swiftness, liver to cleanse toxins. But the heart is where the vitality lies. Eating the heart was intended to add those stolen years of life to the person who ate it.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;... I don&#39;t remember the waking up itself,&quot; she murmured. &quot;My first memory is looking upon your corpse. Perhaps that is no small part of why you feel so familiar to me, even now. I laid there, watching you, for hours. When I felt hunger begin to gnaw at me, I realized there was a world beyond that small space my attention had stayed in.&quot;

She filled the kettle with water, setting it onto the little stove and turning the heat on. &quot;The first hours beyond that were graceless. In time, I managed to be able to move a bit more efficiently when using the sword resting beside me as a crutch. I could barely carry the shield simultaneously, but... I didn&#39;t even consider leaving them behind. I could not hunt, but I managed to barely sustain myself off of various berries and such I was able to forage. At some point, I found a sturdy branch to better use as a walking stick; it helped matters some. In time, I came across a small village. I was pitied, and shown hospitality for a few days.&quot;

Her gaze lingered on the kettle as she spoke, though she seemed to be looking through it more than actually paying attention to it. &quot;I quickly crafted a story about what had happened to me to justify my condition. A tragedy years ago--but now I had been lost in the woods for a time, and my tools for mobility separated from me. It was well received enough. I was pointed towards a larger town with a craftsman who ultimately created a prosthetic for me, in return for my assistance in an alchemical matter. It made walking much easier, though it introduced some new pains; though the flesh on my arm and leg is sealed, it is not in the manner a surgical amputation is done. The ends of my bones press directly against the skin, and as I put weight on my leg again, there is often a sensation as though the bone will pierce through my flesh with the pressure. If I am on my feet for too long, sometimes a sore will develop, so perhaps that is a very real possibility.&quot;

As the kettle began to whistle, she stirred into motion again, taking it off the stove to begin to steep the tea. It appeared the blend she had grabbed was one of pine needles and vanilla. 

&quot;From the time I pulled myself from my resting place, Ven was always nearby. I found amusement in this, in his insistence that I was a meal-to-be. As if he couldn&#39;t understand that my being up and moving contradicted evidence that I was dead. But I figured if he endeavored to accompany me, I would be hospitable, and so whenever possible, I left him odd scraps. Which, of course, assured he would continue to linger. I thought, as I moved south in hopes for more comfortable weather, he would finally lose interest, but evidently not. His premature intrigue in the not-yet-dead led me to make Hiraeth&#39;s acquaintance, as the man had fallen down a steep ravine in his travels. Ven drew my attention to him, and I was able to get him back to his feet. I found him very easy to be around, and so we traveled together on his way back to Fielbarry, and he allowed me to live in his home in the absence of a proper place of my own. We have been able to help with one another&#39;s unique deficits, and he arranged for me the employ I currently have.&quot;

&quot;Just living companions, then? Nothing more developed between the two of you?&quot; He asked a bit cautiously, but while there was some concern to his words, there was both... a little bit of fear, but also worry for the easygoing tiefling back in that cottage. He could hardly have blamed Eidunn for moving on when she had no idea she had someone to move on from, and he couldn&#39;t blame the other tiefling either.

I think he appreciated living around someone who did not pity or coddle him for his own disabilities. He has a mangled leg of his own, and chronic pain that sometimes has him bedridden.&quot;

She eyed the tea for a moment, gauging its color, before lifting it to pour into each of the mugs. &quot;If he feels romantically towards me, he has never let on to it. And I can&#39;t say I would reciprocate. There is nothing wrong with who he is,&quot; she added, &quot;But... it&#39;s strange. At least, it seems strange in the wake of me kissing a man I have no memories of having previously known--but prior to this evening, I&#39;ve simply had no desire towards such a partnership in any capacity.&quot;

Setting the kettle aside again, she lifted a mug in each hand, very carefully (as she consequentially did not have her staff) limping over to hand one to Nils. &quot;... Admittedly, it feels like being suddenly flung into deep water. Not unpleasant, but... suddenly floating in a space you have no traction upon.

She lost herself for a few seconds, looking over his features and trying to immerse herself in the look of him without actively trying to remember anything, lest the headaches return. After a moment, she reached forward and lightly pinched his chin between her thumb and the crook of her forefinger, before turning to limp back over towards the bath, holding her own tea in her spectral hand. 

&quot;I also want to stop smelling like mud,&quot; she added wryly. Taking a sip of her tea, she gently set it aside on the rim of the tub, shifting to sit alongside it as her hands pulled up the hem of her dress so she could access her left thigh. With a careful push and gentle twist--and a soft hiss of pain--she freed the prosthetic leg she had been walking in from the stump of her thigh, carefully dropping it aside to the ground. 

She hadn&#39;t shown any signs of pain whatsoever prior to that point, and her demeanor settled back to neutrality again as she looked over the limb, though with an absently displeased look on her face to find that the days of hiking through the swamp had certainly taken their toll; the end of her thigh came to a bit of a sharp point, and that point was an angry reddened sore that was now oozing a bit of blood in the absence of the prosthetic&#39;s compression.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;This is nothing. A troll tried to disembowel me the other day. Multiple times. And when I say <em>try</em>, I don&#39;t mean he missed. This body looks more fragile than it is.&quot;

She reached to the first of several small buttons running down the center of the front of her dress, unfastening it--but pausing before she did the same to the second. &quot;...

When it was appropriately loosened, she carefully peeled it off over her head, leaving her in just her underwear and a bralette that laced in the front.

She was not torn <em>open</em> as Nils had last seen her, but where her body had fused itself back together, the scars were more like seams. Thick ridges that almost looked like she was a container that could be opened and shut, and this was merely the appearance of those separate edges presently resting together. The most prominent of these lines very messily endeavored to split her torso in half, beginning just under the left side of her ribcage and jaggedly tearing up diagonally across her chest. It was far from the only mark, either, that entire region of her torso decorated in a myriad of similar &quot;seams&quot; and even what looked to be burn scars, with rough lines where several somethings had stabbed into her abdomen and ripped downwards, or carved into her shoulder and tore upwards. The upper arm on her left side, now out of the sleeve that had been covering it, barely had any unmarred flesh left on its surface, and laid bare, the marks from the wound that claimed her arm looked especially messy.

In reality, the only real improvements from the last time he saw her body was the present lack of blood, and all the flesh being more or less sealed back together. But though no viscera was exposed, it was otherwise uncannily close to the condition of her corpse, looking like even the most accidentally impactful treatment would have her splitting apart again. 

The only things that didn&#39;t match up to how her corpse had appeared were a few, very thin lines of scabs surrounded by pinkened flesh, sweeping more or less horizontally across her gut and ribs. Whatever injury it had been looked to be healing very nicely and was little more than a cat scratch at this point, completely unrelated to the deep and mangled scarring on the rest of her.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, May 29, 2022 11:08 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As it turned out, the prosthetic was a bit deeper than just the crescent-shaped piece most glass eyes were, ultimately comprising about half the mass of her nonexistent eyeball. As she pried it free and set it aside to be cleaned later, it left a cavernous void in her socket, the back wall of which looking like the rest of the missing mass was made up of thick scar tissue. Vultures weren&#39;t very good surgeons. 

From there, she loosened the lacing on her bralette, slipping it free, before her underwear followed suit, and she carefully maneuvered herself into the water, a contented sigh slipping free at the soothing warmth. The twin to the piercing Nils now wore in his lip was right where it had always been on her right nipple--but her left breast was torn through by the same scarring that chewed up that side of her body, the most prominent seam line running clean through it and somewhat warping its shape. 

Closing her eyes, she dipped her head beneath the water briefly, before surfacing again and lifting her hand to wipe off her face, her ears even giving a tiny flutter to shake off the water droplets. &quot;... You were right about warm baths,&quot; she murmured, shifting herself to rest against the side of the relatively large tub. &quot;It was regretfully long before I managed to acquire one after first waking.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Fortunately, her layers of concealing clothes kept her immediate body from being actively gross--and almost jarringly, her right leg was about as far away from the trauma that had killed her as possible, so apart from some miscellaneous scars that she had carried in life, was in pristine condition. Which was good, seeing as it was solely responsible for bearing her weight now. 

&quot;Let&#39;s see... My employer is a tiefling named Jaska. One of Valentine&#39;s brothers. He&#39;s... professional. A bit withdrawn, a bit aloof. Straight-backed and a gaze that cuts through glass, but one of the types who won&#39;t create issues with you if you are beneficial to him, which I believe I am. Despite his demeanor, he has a daughter--adopted, if I am not mistaken, and not biological--a little albino tiefling who scarcely speaks. But he is immensely in love with her. It&#39;s quite charming, despite how much effort he puts into an intimidating figure. Hiraeth works for him as well, tending to the plants that produce some manner of drug which Jaska sells.&quot; She waved her hand dismissively. &quot;All of this, of course, is not information he would appreciate me sharing, so for all intents and purposes, you know none of it. But he is... pleasant, in his own unorthodox way. Professional, cordial, and mindful to keep the relationships with his chosen allies healthy. Not particularly personable or friendly, but I find him agreeable company. And I&#39;d be lying to say I did not appreciate someone who not only is unflinching in the face of my work, but readily rewards me for it.&quot;

She sank back into the water comfortably, until she was submerged up to the top of her neck. &quot;The guild is much more colorful. Grander, and yet... lacks that rigid professionalism in my experience. Altaira, of course... she is the picture of professionalism. As she ought to be, acting as the head of such an organization. The hunters are... well. The guild appears willing to hire any type of person, as long as they can do the job. Most, in my experience so far, tend to err on the side of chaotic, good-natured antics. Perhaps some occasionally questionable morals. But enough of them have a good head on their shoulders to keep things moving forward. I&#39;ve yet to encounter any who are outright unpleasant or overtly malicious, but some occasionally toe the line between being silly and being a liability.&quot; She tipped her head thoughtfully.

&quot;From my time spent with you--short though my memory says it is--I would hazard to presume you would get on quite swimmingly with the majority of them. They&#39;re not a bad bunch. But <em>chaotic</em> is the word I keep coming back to.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;You seem to be a good hugger,&quot; she murmured back. &quot;I won&#39;t mind.&quot; Which would be strange if she stopped to think on it--how easily she found herself falling into rhythm with all this, when mere hours prior, she would have wholeheartedly rejected any such idea on principle of simple, total disinterest. The mystery of that phenomenon was laid bare, so all that was left was just... to drift along and accept the reflexes she didn&#39;t realize she had within her, or to keep some sort of aloof distance out of principle. But the former inevitably felt like choosing to embrace this strange, unexpected challenge presented to her, to not be made sheepish by something merely due to its foreignness--and she couldn&#39;t resist meeting the oddities with all hesitation thrown to the wind. So far, it was proving very rewarding. 

She tilted her head as he nuzzled his against her, brushing her nose against his again briefly, before adjusting to press her lips back to his, all chaotic mess gone and leaving the gesture the uninhibited focus.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sliding her good leg forward, she planted her foot on the bottom of the tub and rocked her weight onto it, transitioning to a sort of lopsided crouch with her hand bracing her. She wouldn&#39;t be able to stand straight up without tipping over, as she wouldn&#39;t be able to still reach her grip on the tub for stability, so instead she only straightened her leg enough to transition to sitting on the edge of the tub, and then carefully rotating herself so her leg was draped on the outside instead.

Looking up again, her spectral hand simply detached itself from the stump of her arm, temporarily losing its hand-like definition as it wisped through the air like a mote of smoke, before regaining its more anatomical silhouette so it could grasp on to a nearby towel and pull it back towards its host. Now seated and not in danger of falling over, she freed her good hand to work in tandem with the spectral one, shaking out the towel to unfold it and draping it around herself.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was clearly an effort to navigate on foot without her other leg--which made it all the more sobering to think of the weeks, perhaps months, that she had done so when she first reawakened, with only a sword to use as a crutch. All the same, she had evidently developed good core strength for it, alternating between leaning heavily on her staff and hopping forward on her good leg.

Fortunately, she didn&#39;t have far to travel, easing herself back down to the mattress as she arrived, and tilting her staff to rest it against the wall by the bedside. Letting out a sigh from that minor exertion, she wiggled into a more comfortable position alongside Nils so he could reach her, settling in to use her towel to wipe down her glass eye as he handled her hair.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
