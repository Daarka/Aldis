His tail shifted in unsettled motions, but when questioned, would only mutter that he thought he kept catching scent of something on the wind, but he wasn&#39;t sure what. Wolf, but not wolf. But also not werewolf. And he only caught the scent when the wind shifted and he caught a sniff, promptly before the individual or individuals in question moved to keep downwind.

It wasn&#39;t until twilight had set in that Kaleva had paused abruptly, and moved outside to stand on the porch, staring out into the encroaching darkness.

Shapes moved, ghostly and silent through the trees, their eyes flashing from the reflected light of the cottage. Wolves, natural and wild. And one more humanoid shape that moved with them, and had similarly reflecting eyes, who stopped to stare back at Kaleva as he emerged.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not that she didn&#39;t trust Kaleva was genuine about what he was reporting. She would bet her life on the accuracy of his senses. But the comparison her mind involuntarily made to a neurotic little dog still quietly amused her.

When he abruptly made for the porch, she blinked, looking up from the book she had been reading. Delicately setting it aside, she followed behind him, peeking her head out around the side of his frame to see for herself. 

Living out in the forest, it wasn&#39;t unusual to be visited by wildlife. At first, she was ready to dismiss the gleaming eyes as just a pack of wolves making Kaleva&#39;s wolf senses tingle--but she was too perceptive to not catch the oddity of the gleaming eyes at a more humanoid height. After a beat taken to process this information, she whispered a soft word in celestial, and the gold of her eyes became drowned out in solid black as she felt outward with her magic to pick up on any varieties of creature that could be cause for alarm.

What stood before them was as natural to this realm as the wolves surrounding him. He wasn&#39;t easy to make out in the half-light, but one got the impression of a basic male humanoid shape with long, slightly curled hair in wild tangles around his head. He didn&#39;t approach, didn&#39;t speak. Just stood there while the wolves circled, and watched.

Kaleva looked upon them, and there was something in his blood that called to them. A wildness that yearned to run with them, to hunt with them. But he stayed beside Skena, and the silence stretched uncomfortably long. &quot;...I think we might have set up in their territory,&quot; he breathed quietly.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At Kaleva&#39;s words, she blinked, the gold returning to her eyes (though the magical aura persisted for the moment) as she looked up at him. 

&quot;... Should we apologize?&quot; She wondered, matching the volume of his voice. &quot;We have... quite a lot of food that wolves would like.&quot;

Between feeding Kaleva and feeding Atreyu, any wolf would want them as neighbors.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But before he could act on it, the humanoid figure stepped forward and began to approach. As he left the confusing shadows of twilight-lit trees, his features came into view. He looked human enough, except for the blatantly wolfish eyes, pointed ears, clawed fingers, and the unmistakable tail. Older than them by a few years, but not much. His skin was weather-worn, wearing handmade hides, and holding a longbow in one hand, with a bow-mounted quiver holding six hand-fletched arrows.

Kaleva held his ground, though the hairs on his nape began to rise up. The man gave Skena a glance and a faint sniff, but seemed to dismiss her as he got right up close to Kaleva, and the two of them stood tensely postured, sizing each other up.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

So she kept her mouth shut, standing close enough to be able to immediately whip up magic to knock this stranger on his ass if he lunged, but not making a move to do so unless and until this man drew first.

In his head, Kaleva would be joined with the familiar presence of her voice. 

<em>&#39;... Should I be doing something? Going to get the food? Is this a dogperson thing right now?&#39;</em>

Because it certainly wasn&#39;t what normal humans interacted like.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A low, animalistic rumble exited the man&#39;s lips, curling them up to flash some very wolf-like teeth. He spoke then, but slowly, as though unfamiliar with the language. &quot;I am accustomed to others ignoring territorial marks. But you are not other.&quot; He... didn&#39;t inflect properly, or at least not with any sort of emotion that was easy to place. &quot;You should know better.&quot;

Kaleva... felt a slight tickle of embarrassment at that, and fought to keep his strong stance and not wilt. &quot;I... was aware that a pack lived in the area. I didn&#39;t think I would be considered a threat to it.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Skena had spent her entire life around dogs. Her best friend was basically part dog. Everything around her was some form of dog, it seemed. She knew she was small and didn&#39;t look like a threat, but she was also equal parts homeowner here as Kaleva... and she&#39;d gotten respect out of canines larger than herself before.

&quot;You have our apologies for trespassing,&quot; she said simply, neither aggressive nor fearful in tone and demeanor. She still stood directly beside Kaleva, schooling her outward expression and tone into one of calm confidence.

&quot;We have no desire to cause harm to you. We&#39;d be willing to feed you and your pack tonight, if you would accept that as our more direct apology. There&#39;s no reason we cannot be friends and allies.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Like his voice, his face also didn&#39;t reflect like a normal man&#39;s. He had bared his teeth like a wolf would, and his pointed ears shifted in ways that a wolf&#39;s would. And now he leaned in closer to her, to sniff at her like he had Kaleva.

&quot;...We are not strays for you to feed.&quot; He looked between them, and a couple of the wolves had ventured near as well. They were certainly interested in Kaleva&#39;s smell, sensing the wolf within, but they were skittish about Skena, only emboldened by their humanoid packmate&#39;s proximity. &quot;You do not intend to leave.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Kaleva concurred slowly. &quot;We have made a home here. We wish to live the rest of our lives here. We do not wish to drive you out of your territory. We just ask to be able to share it.&quot;

The man let out a low grunt. He stared at them in long silence, and then spoke again slowly, his voice deep and soft and rumbling. &quot;Pay attention to the markers. Stay far from our den. Show her where the boundary is so she does not pass either. If you come near the den, we will kill you.&quot;

The reason for such might become apparent with one of the wolves standing far behind him. A black female with brown highlights along her shoulders and rump was round with pups, likely due to give birth within the week.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“I did not interpret you and your pack as strays,” she replied simply. “I interpreted you as neighbors. I would have offered to share dinner with any neighbor or friend.”

She gave a gentle nod towards the pack. “If my presence makes them uneasy, I can make myself scarce as well. As we’ve both said, we mean no harm.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Either way, he seemed to make up his mind about them after a moment, turning to walk away. &quot;Treat these woods with respect, or be driven out. We will see each other again.&quot;

Kaleva&#39;s glance flitted from the man to one of the wolves that had grown so bold as to sniff at their feet, stiff-legged and back bristled, head low as she pulled back her lips from her teeth to nip at Skena&#39;s skirt and give it a quick tug before releasing and leaping back. The man turned his head to let out a low, growling bark, and the young gray and brown female quickly went over to him, belly low to the ground and tail wagging, lips pulled into a smile of appeasement and ears flat. He leaned down and mouthed over the top of her muzzle with low rumbles, and once the discipline was administered, both rejoined the rest of the pack.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The new man thought the twins would be a threat to him, having a blood right to the throne, so he ordered them killed. They were left out by the river to die, but the river god took pity on them. A she-wolf adopted them and suckled them to keep them alive, and they were eventually found by a peasant shepherd who took over raising them. When they were fully grown, they became aware of who they truly were, and worked together to displace the man who had driven their grandfather from the throne. They succeeded, but in the aftermath, disagreed over where to build the new kingdom. In the end, Romulus killed Remus, and the city built was named after the surviving brother: Rome.”

Siscia wasn’t her native land, but it neighbored Cusai, and so of all the foreign pantheons on Aldis, it was the one she was most familiar with after that of her own heritage.

“They’re depicted in art often with the she-wolf, though in the big picture, she didn’t play a role in their story for very long. She was never given a name, either; not even by the bards who tell the story these days. And Rome is an ancient name of an ancient kingdom; Acagota is the capitol of Siscia, and is built on the ruins that were once Romulus’ kingdom.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Even he seemed… kind of sad about it.” A beat, and then she opened her eyes again to glance up at him.

“Don’t tell him I told you this… he specifically waited until you were gone to say it, but… when I talked about working towards being able to open up direct communication with Anubis more freely, he asked if… when I was able, I could ask if Set loves him. For as shameless as he is about all his choices in life… I think it’s… inevitable that a deity aasimar like us are so intimately connected to—and who are our <em>fathers</em> on top of that—it’s…”

She sighed. “… I’ve heard some clergymen and philosophers speculate that being devoured by Ammit in the Hall of Two Truths is not meant to mean you cease to exist. It is the Hell of our afterlife because you do still exist, but you are removed from <em>existence</em>. There’s the idea that Hell is simply existing in the forced absence of the gods. Because to be in a god’s presence—even indirectly, as we are now, living in their creation—is the peak of mortal fulfillment. And… I feel that when I stand beside Anubis in my dreams. Achoris wouldn’t have had to even tell me how much he missed his own father. If he truly had no part of himself that still ached to hear Set’s voice… that’s when I would be wary of him and consider him a monster.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The next day, late into the afternoon when evening was starting to approach and the temperature was cooling down, Kaleva took Skena and Atreyu through the woods, seeking out the markers that would warn them they were approaching the den site. He only had a general direction to go off of, but that proved to be enough when his nose caught the scent of territorial boundary.

Cupping his hands around his mouth to make the sound carry farther, he took in a deep breath and let out a long, rather musical howl. When it tapered away, he paused to listen for a minute or so, and then howled again.

One by one, his call was answered with the howls of their new neighbors, and Kaleva flashed a grin to Skena. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t be long, they sound close.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was so rare that she wasn’t dressed in layers and long, draping fabrics like skirts, that it was almost a little jarring how extremely waifish she looked when she was in form-fitting clothes. The illusion of her almost having normal mass was upheld only when those dresses and robes disguised where her actual body was; she looked like she would break in half if she so much as tripped. 

Toxic thought he had been, there was some validity in people like Oberon having treated her like she would snap like a dry twig if exposed to just a stiff breeze. It was hard to believe this same little twig body had broken a war hammer over its back on impact.

Despite her fragile presentation, she sat with perfect confidence in Atreyu’s saddle, having learned to ride him over the same period Kaleva did. He was Kaleva’s dog and mount, but as this outing proved, it was more than useful for Skena to also be comfortable working him. She kept the reins slack as they followed Kaleva’s lead, smiling softly at his howl.

“Do you want me to leave the talking to you?” She wondered, half gathering a bit of rein to be able to hold Atreyu in place in case he was tempted to dive forward and greet the wolves prematurely. “I don’t want to ruin this.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He paused, then smirked. &quot;Could prick your finger or something, they&#39;d probably love that.&quot;

A few minutes passed by before the pack began to appear around them, moving like ghosts through the trees, low growls rumbling from their throats, hackles raised. And then the shifter appeared. Stark naked, but holding his bow, his body weathered and honed to his active, wild lifestyle. Scuffed with dirt and dusted with hair, he somehow didn&#39;t seem as naked as the word would imply, for there was nothing vulnerable about it. This was how he was most comfortable. And they were in his home, and he was not dressed for visitors.

He walked right up to them, up to Kaleva, and stood over him with an intense stare. &quot;...You noticed the markers,&quot; he allowed. &quot;Why are you here.&quot;

Kaleva kept his own posture firm, but not challengingly so. Just holding his ground. &quot;We would like to hunt with you and your pack. Together we can take on large game with greater efficiency and less risk. We will leave the kill to you, as your need for it is greater than our own. We can hunt together often, if it goes well, to make sure your pups never go hungry.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She wasn’t exactly surprised to see the shifter naked—though she wondered if he was cold. Clothes did more than just protect modesty… but Skena was always cold, so maybe she was biased with that assumption.

She kept her reins gathered so Atreyu would hold his ground as well, offering the shifter a small, gentle smile. “We wanted to do something nice to make up for building our home in your territory. This was the best idea we had for something you may actually appreciate. I understand you’re not one much for socializing the way we’re accustomed to, but my name is Skena. He’s Kaleva. And this,” she added, patting the dog’s shoulders under her, “is Atreyu. You don’t have to use our names if you don’t want to, but you can have them all the same.”

It would be poor phrasing if he was fey. But fortunately, due to her magical probing the night prior, she knew he wasn’t.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

For his part, Atreyu was on his best behavior. Being tacked up meant it was time to work, and he&#39;d been trained very well to not react to distractions. The shifter took a moment to study Atreyu, noting the bridle and saddle, not entirely shocking to him. He&#39;d seen working dogs before in service to humans.

So trying to choose her words with careful respect, she went on, “The same way mankind has selectively bred certain dogs to get desired traits out of the offspring, this breed was bred for size. I believe there was more involved initially… perhaps a bit of enchantment, as this is not something I think you could selectively breed for without influence like that. But if magic was involved, it was only with the earliest progenitors of the breed. Atreyu here was born and bred the old fashioned way. Apart from his size and his greater capacity for intelligence, he’s a pretty normal dog. He understands common remarkably well,” she added, giving the crest of his neck an affectionate scritch—hoping that she hadn’t just babbled in a way that was unwelcome or detrimental to their attempts at diplomacy.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But with the added strength of their new neighbors, moose seemed more within their realm of possibility, and so he headed to an area that was a bit more marshy, a favorite area for the huge beasts to feed.

He found recent tracks and pointed them out to the others. The wolves sniffed around eagerly, and once everyone had the scent, they took off to follow their quarry, moving low and quiet so as not to startle the beast prematurely.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As they fixed their attention on it, it was clear they had found their moose. A big bull, at least the same size as Atreyu—but with a great deal more weight to him than the lanky puppy had. It was grazing on the tall bushes that tangled up around the trees, one ear swiveled out to listen to the surrounding forest, but seeming to only be watching his surroundings with one eye. 

After all, what predators did a bull moose have to worry about?

Atreyu took notice after a moment as well, and there was an involuntary jerk forward the puppy made in his excitement. With a lightning fast reaction, Skena reined him back in, pulling his head up to avoid him scrambling forward through the leaf litter on the ground and undoubtedly giving them away.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Upon spotting their quarry, Yiska also slowed, and his wolves followed his lead. His gray eyes cut to Atreyu quickly as he startled, familiar with the excitement of puppies, and the look he flashed Skena seemed approving.

And then he changed, his form bulking up and growing into that of a werewolf. Gunmetal blue-gray fur sprouted across his body as it grew and shifted, thick and clearly built for cold climates. White markings dappled his brow, tipped his short ears, graced his nose and upper lip, and traced tear-like marks beneath eyes that had gone intensely blue. A somewhat short tail only reached the backs of his knees, also tipped in white.

That answered Kaleva&#39;s question, and prompted his own transformation as well. But whereas Yiska looked like a fluffy, bipedal wolf, Kaleva&#39;s form was leaner, thinner-furred, with huge triangular ears and sharper features. His tail was almost three times as long as Yiska&#39;s, and he had a ridge of longer fur running from the back of his neck down to his tail. He didn&#39;t lose his horns, either.

Yiska glanced to Skena and motioned for her to circle around and prepare to cut off the moose if it tried to flee. He then lifted his bow, using a sharp hook-like extension along the bottom to nick at his thigh. Thus bloodied, the bow visibly became coated in frost, and he lined up an arrow in preparation.

Taking his cue, Kaleva drew his swords and bloodied them on his arms, the scimitars now wreathed in flames - which the wolves edged back from instinctively, but weren&#39;t too distracted from their quarry.

Once they were ready, Yiska lined up a shot - and fired. And that was his cue for the wolves to lunge forward.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Skena took up very little space on Atreyu’s back, and when holding herself low in the saddle, she became a very small target. And so there she stayed, giving Atreyu his head as the puppy saw those big ol’ antlers and, reminded of some of his chew toys back home, looked to  fix his teeth around them.

Kaleva had been quick to dash up to the massive beast, and even though his werewolf form had given him added height and boosted him to six foot, he was still massively dwarfed by the beast.

Skena let Atreyu attack as he pleased, not seeking to interfere with his judgment of his own capacity to assist the hunt, though her gaze fixed squarely on Kaleva as he took the hit, watching closely to make sure he didn’t go down. Even if he remained conscious, falling prone under the flailing hooves could be a lethal mistake. She hadn’t intended to assist in the hunt with her magic, but nothing would stop her from swooping in with healing if it became necessary. 

But the blow, which it seemed it would leave a nasty bruise, if not some cracked ribs, didn’t seem to be anything Kaleva couldn’t shake off for the time being, so Skena’s magic stayed out of play for now.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Kaleva did have a resistance to such attacks. Which is why his chest wasn&#39;t currently concaved. But that didn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t have a fucking hell of a bruise on his sternum, and his next two slashes with his blade weren&#39;t even close to making contact, swiping at empty air as he stumbled slightly on his paws, shaking his head in a daze.

The arrows certainly looked to be gradually doing a number to it, but it wasn’t quite out for the count yet.

As Kaleva was staggered for the moment, the moose planted its hind legs firmly into the ground, attempting to fling its head back enough to dislodge it from Atreyu’s jaws. 

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">Moose rolls 19, Atreyu rolls 8; moose breaks the grapple</code>

With its massive head free, the bull shuffled several steps back, swinging those sizeable antlers forward to face the wolves attacking it, its head moving in sweeping, threatening gestures to attempt to keep them at bay as it let out what sounded like guttural growls, deep and heavy.

Atreyu gave a little yip of a grunt as the antler was ripped from his mouth, though he was light enough on his feet that the force of it dislodging didn’t fling him back far. As the bull pulled his head back, Atreyu nimbly lashed out with another snap of his jaws, but his teeth clicked shut on only empty air as the moose retreated a few steps.

The moose suddenly having its head free again had Kaleva faltering, still trying to catch his breath. He seemed stunned by the blow he had taken, two more quick swipes catching only air, his purplish tongue hanging out of his mouth.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">Kaleva and Atreyu get attacks of opportunity, but since neither has sentinel or whatever, I’m gonna assume the bull successfully leaves their range after said attacks.

As the bull suddenly charged, Atreyu took another swipe after it, but once again snapped at empty air; even the dog hadn’t been prepared for how fast the tank of a creature could move.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">Attack of opportunity (reaction, not his turn) 9 to hit, misses</code>

Skena was still keeping a close eye on Kaleva. After his next attack also went wide, she whispered a subtle word of celestial, the gesture of her hand as she momentarily freed it from the saddle pommel easily being lost in all the commotion. Kaleva would feel the slight, peaceful warmth of her familiar magic, spreading from the amulet he wore—and with it, his dizzied vision cleared a tiny bit.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">Bless - add a d4 to any of his attack rolls or saving throws</code>

Instead of diving immediately after the bull, however, Atreyu paused to look towards his master, visibly concerned that he was okay. The puppy’s priorities were a little different than everyone else’s; even a moose as a kill wasn’t important enough to not pump the brakes if dad was getting too badly hurt. Skena clearly noticed the dog wasn’t running after their quarry, but didn’t force him to do so, understanding that he needed to see Kaleva was okay first.

The charge was quick and unexpected. He&#39;d thought the moose would go after Kaleva again. Yiska grunted heavily as he was slammed into, but while he tumbled, he managed to land on his white-toed paws, stepping back to notch another arrow and let it loose in the moose&#39;s neck.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">21 to hit, 10 piercing, 3 cold damage</code>

With Skena&#39;s magic helping him shake off the daze of the blow, Kaleva darted in after the moose, closing the distance to slash at the moose&#39;s haunches with his blades. While one of the attacks missed, the other hit, and he scored a bloody and burned line in its haunch.

As Kaleva carved into it from behind, it’s hips buckled in pain, staggering to the side and favoring one hind leg that Kaleva had gashed deeply into.

As Kaleva took off after the bull again, Atreyu seemed sated in his concern, bounding after him and back into the fray. He had no hesitation in jumping back into melee with the massive creature, this time diving forward to fiercely latch his teeth around the moose’s throat. 

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">19 +4 from bless = 23 to hit, 9 piercing damage</code>

He lined up another shot, taking careful aim not to get Atreyu (or Skena) in his sights, and let loose. The arrow sunk home in the moose&#39;s heart, lodged neatly between its ribs, and the great beast finally went down.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">Nat 20, max damage is 12 piercing 4 cold</code>

Yiska strode forward to start yanking out his arrows that they could be reused, showing no signs of pain from his earlier heavy hit. &quot;A good hunt,&quot; he acknowledged of the three. &quot;What part of the moose do you wish to take home with you.&quot;

Sheathing his blades, Kaleva gingerly massaged his chest, thinking about the request. &quot;An antler,&quot; he said at last. It&#39;d make a good chew toy for Atreyu, and he wanted the pack to have the meat.

&quot;You may take both.&quot; Slinging his bow across his shoulders, wolves were already crowding around to start feasting on the massive kill, the pregnant female and her mate snarling away the younger ones. Yiska braced a paw against the moose&#39;s head, and one by one cracked off the antlers and pass them over.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But neither of us need the meat, offal, or hide; you and yours are free to all of it.”

Glancing over to her friend, she let the magic of her blessing fade away, moving over and helping herself to lifting his clothes and armor so she could inspect where the hoof had gotten him and make sure nothing looked broken.

Kaleva reached up to strap the antlers to Atreyu&#39;s saddle, though he winced upon raising both arms over his head. He turned when he was finished so Skena could look him over, arms raised obligingly as she inspected his chest. There didn&#39;t seem to be any bleeding, but if she parted the black fur, what was normally pale skin underneath was marred with deep purple bruising right up against the sternum.

Yiska&#39;s icy blue gaze turned to Skena, short and fluffy ears turning to hone in on her voice. He blinked slightly at her offer. &quot;It&#39;s not necessary. You three do not need to linger here. I will call to you to invite you to hunt again.&quot;

Kaleva settled in behind Skena, arms wrapped around her middle, and held on with his knees as Atreyu got up, stretched, and turned to head for home without needing to be guided.

She shook her head, reining her thoughts back in. &quot;If Jaska wants Hiraeth <em>for</em> his being a druid, that means he either has some sort of plants he&#39;s tending to, or some sort of creature he&#39;s tending to. Maybe simple beasts, but I&#39;ve also heard of druids who are more in tune with things like elemental constructs.
