Since moving into the cabin he had built a few miles outside Fielbarry, Kaleva hadn&#39;t been in town all that much, and when he did, usually it was through the portal door leading into Ingrid and Arsast&#39;s shop.

But Atreyu couldn&#39;t fit through that door now that he was full grown, and he had some wares to sell and supplies to pick up anyway, which were easier to transport on the horse-sized dog.

Kaleva led Atreyu by his reins, walking through the marketplace on his way to the leatherworking shop, several assorted hides draped over the dog&#39;s skinny butt. He was clearly built for speed, all long legs and a deep ribcage.</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=OpenRP><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=OpenRP src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/858984169711206430.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

There had been no complaints, but the sullen teen could hardly imagine finding anything that would hold her attention for now. Of course, she had avoided things she would enjoy, but that was a thought for a later time. Right now, she was trying to find a place where Dog could roam. For now he was happy to keep pace at her side. While the big dog wore a padded harness, it was obvious by his lazy stride that Piper put in no effort to keep him in line. If anything, he was the one setting the walk. If anyone watched for more than a moment, it was clear that when Dog slowed first, Piper soon followed. 
If he snorted, she was carefully with her step or using her foot to sweep for obstacles. 
Coming onto the main street was especially daunting, and Piper tucked herself close to Dog, her hip meeting his and matching him step for step. 

“We’ll still find you a big field.” She promised. “But you may have to bark first when you smell grass.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He let out a bark of greeting, which startled Kaleva out of his focused walk, looking around for what caught Atreyu&#39;s attention.

When he finally landed on Piper and her dog, his resting deadpan face softened into an involuntary smile as he looked at the other canine. &quot;Yeah, he&#39;s almost as big as you, isn&#39;t he?&quot; he said to Atreyu, patting his shoulder.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He had not been specifically trained for the task, but seemed to meld more comfortably to Pipers anti-social personality. 
Dogs the size of horses, however, were a different matter. His black ears similarly perked, tail up but relaxed. 

His normally stoic features changed as his cheeks puffed in preparation for a series of small, huffing barks that ended in an almost husky whine, a playful invite? Or a moments warning for Piper who suddenly gripped the lead a little tighter before her pupper suddenly started to move toward Atreyu and Kaleva and Piper was having to side step to keep up. 

“Wait, hey! Dog! What did we decide on? Heel? Cease!” The girl started tossing hissed commands but there was no real anger or tension in her expression. Closer to uncertainty, and when she finally noted the black skinned Tiefling, a flash of anxiety.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Atreyu wiggled his entire body in excitement, rump and head lowering in good natured submission despite being larger, whining and settling on his stomach to stretch his neck out and sniff at the other dog&#39;s nose.

Kaleva watched them interact for a moment, then looked to Piper. &quot;I like your dog. What&#39;s his name?&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 6, 2022 11:05 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Piper was silent for a moment, pointedly looking at the ground. Her expression no longer read anxious, but she wasn&#39;t immediately looking to meet Kaleva&#39;s gaze or take any steps towards introduction. Her shoulders were slightly raised and rigid. 

&quot;Oh. Dog. His name is Dog.&quot; Was the final answer, even just speaking his name seemed to settle her a little. 

Dog raised his head briefly at hearing his name before eagerly trying to nip at Atreyu&#39;s neck and bounce away directly after.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He didn&#39;t think to offer his own name. Dog names were more important anyway.

Atreyu did little tippy taps on his front paws, clearly eager to play, but being in tack was being in work mode. He turned pumpkin orange eyes to Kaleva beseechingly.

&quot;I know you want to play, buddy, but we&#39;re in the middle of the street. And I don&#39;t know whether or not this lady has places to be.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She did not elaborate any further. 

“Atreyu…Tre.” Was all that followed. It was clear she was mouthing the name after. It was a habit for herself. It always felt easier to file a name or place with repetition, and when Piper was upset it made it easier not to fudge a single like of back talk and look like a fool. 

“I really don’t. Have anywhere to be. I mean, I have a shopping list but it can wait. I don’t get to see Dog play often. I guess that would be nice. He was supposed to be trying to sniff out a field anyway, streets make it hard for me to follow landscape. I tried to tell Gideon it’d be easier if we lived out further but no, he wants all the foot traffic. Who days a walk in for a surgery? Just doesn’t want to have to walk far. Ass.” 

Did it matter if Kaleva knew who she was talking about? Not particularly, because this was clearly a run on thought just spilling out.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Predictably, Dog took the first steps and would try to match Atreyu&#39;s long strides while keeping distance. Piper squinted a bit to look down the road they were following until her walk was more casual. 

Every few seconds, Dog would give one of those eager little huffing barks, as if to remind Atreyu they had important business. 

&quot;Furs. That is a thought, I&#39;ll eventually have to venture out and find some game. I know I&#39;ll need a new winter blanket eventually and I&#39;m not paying for something I can make.&quot; She added stubbornly. 

&quot;Are you building your own place, then?&quot; It was hard to keep guarded when interest was involved and it seemed to Piper that Kaleva clearly knew his way around wilds and subsistence. A survival nature, what could be dangerous about the topic?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Just finished building a house, but there are a couple of smaller structures I want to make. A place to store dried fish, some dog houses for the sled dogs I&#39;m going to get later this year.

Atreyu&#39;s acknowledgement perked Dog&#39;s tail right up, and Piper finally took the chance to really LOOK at Kaleva. She had truly never seen anyone like him, even if she&#39;d met tielfings before. His tail especially eye catching. She had to look back between him and Atreyu at least twice. Like dog like owner?

He noted Piper finally looking him over, seemingly comparing him to Atreyu... And yeah, that was fair. They both did have particularly whippy tails. &quot;Both, yeah.

Disarmed. How could she carry irritation if someone was going to be <em>honest</em>. 

&quot;That makes a lot of sense. I thought...Oh, nothing.&quot; And thank god they had reached the field, because she wasn&#39;t sure how to go about apologizing yet. The colors. While the shapes were not distinct enough for her to see the beauty of geometry or something more profound, the colors were enough take her breathe away. With one hand she dug into the knot that attached rope to harness, loosening it enough to slip it off. She wrapped it securely around her palm and between her thumb. 

As soon as Dog heard the rope slip loose, he whined and jumped towards Atreyu, energy unleashed and ready to incite a chase into open ground. 

&quot;This is not what I expected. Beautiful. I...uh...Thank you for telling me about this! Perfect for Dog.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;It&#39;s no problem. You could probably set up some snares here to catch some rabbits.

She trailed off when she saw him turn and offer them up. Her face was blank, then scrunched as she squinted to make sure she was seeing correctly.

&quot;Dog wait!&quot; Piper cautioned, but too late as Dog decided he was in it to win it and grabbed the biggest hunk of bark. He crunched down repeatedly, bark dropping to the ground so that while he couldn&#39;t fit an end of the branch into his mouth he could at least get a hold and start to tug. He was nothing if not ambitious. 

&quot;Really? Even if just to hear about it. I imagine something like that would take an intense amount of time.&quot; Probably better sight, too. But she couldn&#39;t say that out loud, yet. It choked up in her throat. 

&quot;I guess very different from surgery, too. No one is really taking what is left with them. Although sometimes they want it. A finger in a jar, or a kidney.

&quot;Probably, I&#39;ve never seen her do it myself. Though back when I lived with her years ago and she did them regularly, she&#39;d often be gone for a few hours at a time.

Making sure for thinner stems, flexible and small ones. Standing, she would allow herself to idle and start tying the stems into a chain of flowers.

Solid, even!&quot; She followed with a weird smile, part relief that he was willing to let it come out and not pushing. 

Odder still that she was willing to share this much. 

&quot;The rest is what I figured out myself. Plenty of plants, little a frame shelters and trapping. I&#39;m no slack with a bow and arrow, either. I can at least hit something and don&#39;t have a problem sitting still for a while. I prefer trapping. Or letting Dog catch something. He is pretty good at getting catfish.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He hasn&#39;t figured out how to fish yet. And we&#39;re working on patience.&quot;

He tipped his head back to look up at the clouds floating lazily by overhead. &quot;The guild offers apartments to the people it employs, too. You don&#39;t have to be stuck with him if you don&#39;t want to. But I get wanting to pay him off, so there&#39;s no question of debt.

She laughed softly at the idea of training the horse sized dog. &quot;It might be luck. I can sit there with a big grub in the water, your hand has to go in pretty deep and Dog sits very still until one comes by or goes for a grab.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Never quite got the hang of it myself. But I&#39;m pretty decent with a fish hook or a net.&quot;

He swung his tail around and lifted it up, dangling the tufted tip down and twitching it. &quot;If I&#39;m really desperate, I can use my tail, and that attracts fish like nothing else. Effective, but also painful. I fear one day I&#39;ll catch a fish so massive it bites my tail off.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Suddenly, there was a noisy thud that had Kaleva startling slightly. Atreyu had brought the branch over and dropped it in front of them, stepping back with a bark and a wagging tail.

&quot;...You are out of your mind if you think I can throw that for you. Break off a smaller branch and let me throw that instead.&quot;

And... Amazingly, the dog understood. He tilted his head to the side, floppy ears perked, and then grabbed one of the smaller offshoots, bracing his paw against the branch as he wrenched his head and broke it off, dropping it in front of Kaleva proudly.

The tiefling grabbed it as he stood up, looking at Dog. &quot;I know he&#39;s big and fast, but don&#39;t let him have all the fun. Ready?&quot; He drew back his arm and chucked the stick across the field for the dogs to chase.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
