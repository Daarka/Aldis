And he knew it wouldn&#39;t go over well. Luka was too wholesome, too pure, too... everything, to be okay with the idea that his significant other had to kill and eat people. So when Luka had tentatively asked him why he was so reticent toward telling him exactly what kind of meat he required, had expressed that he just wanted to be able to cook a meal for Achoris that he would actually enjoy...

He told him. And he watched as the blood drained from Luka&#39;s face, as horror and incomprehension set in, as the tiefling asked in a quavering voice if he was <em>sure</em> it was necessary, if there wasn&#39;t some other means of fulfilling his dietary requirements...

He told Luka of his upbringing, of how sickly and frail and exhausted he always was as a child. How the temple had tried everything they could think of, every kind of food, local or imported, how they had tested for allergies, tried to root out the cause of his failure to thrive. And then that moment of stumbling upon a newly-killed corpse in the streets of Cautica, the inexplicable urge to bite, to consume, and how he had felt that sustenance flow into him like the sweetest honey or the finest wine, filling him with warmth, with energy, with vitality. How nothing ever compared or gave that same feeling or effect.

They had ended the conversation with Luka quietly asking if he could have time to think about things, and Achoris letting him go. He hadn&#39;t heard from him in days. Had told Skena of what happened, and the sinking feeling he had that things may very well be over between him and Luka.

Then, not quite a week later, Luka reached out to Achoris, asked if he&#39;d be willing to take part in some experimentation to see if they could find an alternative. After all, magic and medicine had improved quite a bit since Achoris was a child, and maybe they could find a way where he wouldn&#39;t be &#39;shackled to a need to commit murder to survive.&#39;

Achoris explained this to Skena as he packed a bag. &quot;He seems to have been in a frenzy of research. I&#39;ll be staying at his place for the next couple of weeks while he attempts to find a solution.&quot; The way he spoke of it was mostly neutral, but had a strain of bitterness behind it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Find... a solution?&quot; She echoed. Where Achoris had that hint of bitterness, Skena seemed to recognize and agree with its source: she knew, intimately, firsthand, what these dietary restrictions were. She knew it was not, likely, something that could be substituted. 

But... Achoris&#39; echoing of Luka&#39;s comment regarding magical advancements stirred up more than just worry. It stirred up a sudden and unyielding need to involve herself so that such things were done correctly. 

Making lab-grown tissues was not something she had previously explored... but it was very much something she felt she could figure out.

&quot;W... Wait, Achoris. I--I know this isn&#39;t directly my business at all, but... would you consent to me trying to help? I...&quot; she paused, sighing. 

&quot;... We both know what the answer to Luka&#39;s curiosity is. But... I <em>know things</em> about every part of this that Luka does not. I&#39;m a <em>necromancer</em>, and we&#39;re talking about trying to replicate human meat without it coming from a human body. But I also... I&#39;m an aasimar. An aasimar with those same innate dietary restrictions. I know what that deep hunger feels like when I&#39;m not eating right. If... If Luka needs to exhaust options himself to feel comfortable knowing there <em>aren&#39;t</em> alternatives, please let me help facilitate that. I can be efficient and thorough more than he can. And... I can make sure you don&#39;t get hurt in the process. Please...?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I&#39;ve gone longer periods without. My Father made me the way I am for a reason, and He says I am perfect. I love Luka, but he is wrong in seeing my obligate cannibalism as a flaw.

&quot;... I hope, and want to assume, that it&#39;s not that Luka sees it as a flaw. He&#39;s just... a tender heart. I can imagine anyone&#39;s pacifism interfering with their acceptance of this issue. But... we can talk to him together. And... while I am a little curious now if I could somehow manufacture something that nurtured you the same way, I don&#39;t expect that to happen. But I can make sure you are not starving to the point of it threatening your health substantially.&quot; She made a bit of a face.

&quot;... I don&#39;t like the idea that you should have to starve at all to go through this exercise. But... maybe you&#39;re right, and Luka seeing what it does to you will have <em>him</em> calling the &#39;experiment&#39; off even before I do. One... One second.&quot;

She skittered away then, putting on her own shoes and some warmer outerwear, as well as grabbing her messenger bag and stuffing it full of a few textbooks she selected off a shelf. And then stuffing Gummy in on top. 

&quot;Kaleva!&quot; She called out. &quot;I&#39;m gonna head out with Achoris for a bit, I&#39;ll... fill you in later.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I&#39;ll be back in a couple of weeks.&quot; The look she gave him was entirely unimpressed, and she huffed out a sigh as she went back out into the yard to watch the antics of the peasant dogs and their peasant master.

&quot;You&#39;ll look after her, won&#39;t you? I realize I didn&#39;t ask.&quot; Achoris looked to Skena as they headed through the portal to Finders Keepers.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It didn&#39;t take long to get to Luka&#39;s parlor, and he was just closing up shop as they arrived. The smile he gave Achoris was welcoming and hopeful, though he did a double-take at Skena. &quot;Oh! Hello, Skena, it&#39;s wonderful to see you.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Further back in the shop, a magpie was hopping and fluttering about as it (somewhat tediously) went about the process of trying to fold a hand towel using only its beak and feet. Because it was magpie-form only during business hours.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Achoris blinked at the magpie. &quot;Did you pick up a pet bird now, too? Won&#39;t Victoria try to eat it?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s Szix,&quot; Luka said with a slight laugh. &quot;There was a... an incident, with Axa. Anyway, he&#39;s living with me now, and I trust you both to know what he is. Szix, you can change back if you want to.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In a quick flutter of color and shape, a brick-colored imp squatted where the bird had been a moment prior, dressed in... whatever handmade good intentions Luka had dressed him in, and bearing an appeasing grin (or grimace) towards Achoris and Skena. 

Skena&#39;s brows lifted. &quot;Oh. She kept one this time. Curious.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Achoris chuckled deeply. &quot;No, of course not.&quot; He sent a nod to the imp. &quot;So you have him helping out around here?&quot;

&quot;He wanted to be useful, and I don&#39;t mind his help.

Skena gave the imp a polite smile, though there was a faint stitch to her brow. Deeply educated in matters of the outer planes--with an even more in-depth education on the layers of Baator and its denizens--she was immediately familiar with what was happening, though she had not experienced it before.

The closer a being was to goodness, even to celestial influence, the bigger the prize for a fiend to corrupt it, after all. 

&quot;Pleasure to meet you as well--Szix, was it?&quot;

&quot;Yes!! Yes, very much!&quot;

A bit tricky working around the wings, but I think he dresses up quite nicely.&quot; Luka locked the door and flipped the closed sign around, gesturing them to follow him upstairs to his home.

They were greeted by a delicate, quiet honk as a sleek, large-eared feline trotted over, wearing her own little sweater in soft cream and pale rose. &quot;Hello, darling,&quot; Luka cooed as he scooped her up in his arms and smooched her cheek, and she started purring immediately. &quot;Skena, you haven&#39;t met Victoria, have you?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

To Skena, he replied, &quot;Both. I mean, if the deceased had willingly donated their body to be knowingly consumed, I suppose I wouldn&#39;t have such an issue with it, but I don&#39;t imagine such a thing to be commonplace enough to be sustainable.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I worked in the temple of Anubis. You know that. But... what that meant was that my day job was not... I don&#39;t know. Officiating weddings or leading sermons of worship, as could be found in other temples, but handling the deceased. And... sometimes bodies arrive at such establishments without loved ones attached. I know it sounds like it would be uncommon, but... sometimes they simply go into the earth, and we never even knew their name. We just did our best to honor their remains, because it was all that <em>could</em> be done. And... in such cases, where there are no individuals amongst the living who seem to have a personal attachment to the deceased to the extent that they would find repurposing of their bodily materials offensive to their sensibilities... I suppose I&#39;ve always struggled to understand the issue. Even for deceased who <em>do</em> leave living loved ones behind to mourn them, while I understand that their comfort is important, I personally struggle to make sense of why we think dead tissues and organs that all rot into a rancid soup inside of them still has some form of identity. When I so strongly believe that said identity has moved on to another form of life.&quot;

She squinted a little, giving Luka a half-shrug. &quot;... Do you think it disrespectful of me to have repurposed a handful of dead animals to create Gummy? The fellow creatures that knew those animals in life do not mourn them the way we mourn our dead. And had I not used their bodies, those materials would have been claimed by nature sooner or later and eroded away until they were part of the soil again. I understand the idea that consent is important, honoring the deceased&#39;s final wishes. But while I understand that idea... it... feels flimsy in practice, doesn&#39;t it? We should honor the deceased&#39;s wishes for how they are to be remembered and celebrated, but... we don&#39;t <em>control</em> what happens to their body, even when the deceased leaves instructions about it. That is a force of nature beyond us. No matter what, all bodies will go back to the soil sooner or later. When a soul leaves its vessel... is it not just... as much a lifeless material as a piece of driftwood? Any more than that is practically an anthropomorphization, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Her voice was tenative, gentle. Not wanting to argue necessarily, but... delicately suggest her ideologies as something to merely consider.

&quot;... This is very subjective, I understand,&quot; she added after a moment. &quot;And it&#39;s your prerogative to feel however it is you feel. I suppose I just... can&#39;t help but voice my own thoughts on the matter, as... someone who&#39;s life has revolved an incredible amount around what happens to the bodies of the deceased. Humanoid or otherwise.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Do you mean to say that the Temple of Anubis would have been okay with the bodies of the deceased being carved up and fed to other people? I know that fundamentally, we are all animals, but those of us with the higher brain function to truly contemplate such things as what happens to our bodies after death... We still have a right to say what happens to our bodies when we die.

Enough to use it as grounds to exile me from the only home I&#39;ve ever known. And yet, I never lost the magic bestowed unto me by Anubis... and in time, I learned He took no issue with my craft at all. Which is to say... the temple&#39;s standards of what is right and wrong are not something my morals are contingent on. Not unlike Achoris... I heed my god above all else. While I do not explicitly know Anubis&#39; stance on cannibalism... it <em>was</em> a part of my religious upbringing to see the dead as two separate entities: the soul, and the lifeless vessel left behind. And the latter, as far as I&#39;ve been reassured by Anubis, is a part of the earth, whether it has returned to soil yet or not. And mankind is wont to use the natural materials around them as resources, from which we make everything we surround ourselves with.&quot; A beat. 

“Also, some Cautican funeral rites do involve consuming the flesh of the deceased, yes. I’ve done it strictly in those settings, though I do not enjoy it from a culinary perspective. It is considered an act of honoring the deceased by taking that first step towards sending them along the cycle of life.” She slid a finger behind her amulet to lift it a fraction from her chest. “That is the significance of a scarab, a sacred symbol of a creature who breaks down decay and creates new life from it, the unglamorous segment of that cycle that is just as valuable as the miracle of childbirth.”

She sighed out a quiet breath, glancing briefly at Achoris. &quot;Achoris does not follow Anubis, however. But he <em>does</em> follow Set. Furthermore, Set <em>bore</em> him, created him within his own body like a mother would through a womb. Set is a god of chaos, yes, amongst other things--but chaos and evil are not synonymous. It&#39;s been my belief, for as long as I&#39;ve known Achoris, that Set&#39;s chaos manifests uniquely in Achoris&#39; dietary restrictions. For what is more chaotic and off-putting and entirely unexpected than a need to cannibalize, of all possibilities for nutrition? Perhaps his domain over war also plays a role with the consequential bloodshed.&quot; She shrugged a little.

&quot;But... I have been blessed enough to share dreams with Achoris. To see Set with my own eyes. To speak to Him directly, as I do my own god.&quot; Her brows furrowed as she offered Luka a small, but meaningful smile. &quot;Luka... I&#39;ve watched a god tell Achoris that Achoris is perfect. That his fall was self-imposed, because Set Himself had never truly taken issue with His son. Least of all for the diet He Himself built him to require. That was the will of a god. One whom my own father permitted to share in our joint dream and did not strike down on sight, so... I find merit in His values, even if they are not always identical to my own.&quot;

She paused, before sucking in a deep breath. &quot;... I won&#39;t pretend I don&#39;t have a bias, though it is only for the aforementioned reason, and my own ties to these gods: I do not question that which such deities dictate to me as being their will, and I have effectively heard the ruling on this from the horse&#39;s mouth, so to speak. However, I fully respect you, Luka, and whatever your values may be, whether they align with my own or not. I feel it would be a disservice to Achoris to come here with the intention of helping, but not at least let you hear my personal bias on this matter and where it comes from. That said... I&#39;m... still very willing to help you. If it will put your mind at rest to know that all alternatives have been exhausted, I&#39;m willing to help facilitate that.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

When he finally spoke, it was with a sigh. &quot;I understand what you&#39;re saying, that his cannibalism is by design. I understand and agree that it doesn&#39;t make him evil, or bad. But my issue lays with the victims. The people he&#39;s murdered, and will murder to sate his hunger. The people who did not consent to being killed and eaten. I cannot condone that. And I cannot just... Write off a person&#39;s body as <em>materials</em> after they die. If everyone felt that way, there would be no such thing as funerals, or burial rites, no reason to prepare a body after death as you were trained to do.&quot;

He looked at Skena then. &quot;Think of someone you hold dear to your heart. Think of their life coming to an end. What will you do with their body? Will you respect it, clean and prepare it for whatever rites they would have preferred?

Working so closely with death as a lifestyle the way I have, I&#39;ve... thought about my loved ones dying quite a bit. Probably more than the average person in their relationships. And you likely won&#39;t be content with my answer to that, either: I would object to someone like Kaleva having their body eaten or used post-mortem, but solely because I would want to do something with it myself. Make something special from his bones, something I could use to celebrate him the way I celebrate the little rats I&#39;ve loved who have died by giving them new purpose in death. And for those I have loved whose bodies I have no interest in after their death... no, I do not care if something eats them. If their preference is to be buried and given their desired rites, I will do so, but what happens to them after that is beyond my control.&quot; Her smile grew a touch more hollow. &quot;I have done just that. More recently than I would have preferred. Growing up, the man was like an uncle to me. A part of me does still carry a deep love for him, but it&#39;s possible he has been dug up by some animal and torn apart. That does not bother me. It is just another way for him to rejoin that same cycle; a wolf consumes him, or fungus and worms do. The difference is inconsequential to me.&quot;

She gave a little shrug. &quot;I... do mean what I&#39;ve said, in that I&#39;m willing to help you and Achoris explore alternatives. But I must be honest with you from the start: I don&#39;t expect an effective substitute exists. That&#39;s... just not the way we&#39;re built. And if that is true, if humanoid meat is the <em>only</em> thing that will sustain Achoris, then how is he any different from any predatory creature acting within its nature? People like us can feel terrible for the prey who is torn apart in the process, but the predator deserves survival as well.&quot; A beat. &quot;A survival wherein it is not made to feel guilty for being what it was made to be,&quot; she added, more gently. &quot;Obligate predators are a natural part of this world. The world is designed to turn the suffering of prey into new life, but if the predator suffers starvation, not only is the suffering merely transferred instead of prevented, but that suffering no longer serves a purpose.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The idea of consuming other people? You... Technically, you have survived without it. The years in your youth, and then the years you were held captive.&quot;

&quot;Technically,&quot; Achoris replied drolly. &quot;Growing up without knowing what I needed was objectively easier in that I did not know what it was to not be constantly ravenously hungry, but for regular food to taste like ash in my mouth and to not fill the void in my stomach no matter how much I choked down. I did not know what it was to not be tired all the time, to not lack the energy or strength for the simplest of things. I endured then because I never knew otherwise. And then I found what I needed to thrive. I learned what it was like to live. Returning to that state of starvation in my captivity rendered me half crazed and delirious.&quot;

&quot;But it is possible,&quot; Luka coaxed gently. &quot;In better circumstances, in a better environment.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Achoris said bitterly. &quot;It is possible. But it is not a state of existence I would consider acceptable.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He deserves to be happy and free of pain, and... the way he spent his early years, deeply malnourished and sickly, and the way he spent his years in the captivity of someone who saw him as an inhuman possession undeserving of empathy... those are things he survived, yes. But he&#39;s right, those are not standards of living he should be content with. Just as Victoria may manage to continue to exist on a diet of some sort of tofu--but exist with health complications that wouldn&#39;t have been present otherwise, and constantly feel less than her best self. Perhaps even exist in a constant state of hunger. No one deserves that life, and I know you wouldn&#39;t condemn anyone to such an existence. So just... keep that in mind, okay? In case we can&#39;t find an alternative for him. He&#39;s willing to try, and that alone tells me how much he loves you, but if the answer is truly that there are no alternatives, you need to also love him enough to not obligate him to a life of starvation as a result.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She stood, heading over to where Gummy was the king of <s>his castle</s> her bag on the floor, picking it up and unceremoniously dumping him out of it to bring her bag back over to where she had been seated. Gummy gave a grumbly yowl of displeasure as he landed on the floor, and promptly began slinking away to find something to get into.

&quot;I brought some of my relevant research material, and... I think I could manage to attempt creating lab-grown meats. It&#39;s not something I&#39;ve done before--but so much of my magic and studies are adjacent to that, it surely can&#39;t be that hard for me to figure out. Normally, I&#39;d start with a less extreme option, like interrogating Achoris about what he hasn&#39;t tried yet--but I&#39;m not wasting my breath on that.

Achoris gave Skena a nod. &quot;They quite literally sent people to every corner of the globe to bring back every kind of food, fruit, vegetable, and animal they could find for me to try over the course of roughly eighteen years.&quot;

Luka, looking for a bit of levity, gave Achoris a smile. &quot;So it&#39;s safe to say you didn&#39;t like any of them, but did you have one that you <em>disliked</em> the most?&quot;

&quot;Surstr&#246;mming,&quot; Achoris said immediately. &quot;From Holbrook. Fermented sea herring. Imagine a can being opened, to the immediate result of several people coughing, gagging, retching, and vomiting as they ran to leave the room while others opened the windows and immediately started trying to waft out the stench.&quot; He crinkled up his nose. &quot;I tried it, still, I had to, and to this day it is the worst thing that has ever been in my mouth. I couldn&#39;t even swallow it.&quot; He paused, then added with a smile, &quot;I took the leftover can and painted the juices on all of the clothing, furniture, and belongings of a priest I particularly despised.

&quot;Well... As far as I can glean,&quot; she started, fishing out one very dense-looking textbook and cracking it open to leaf through, &quot;It starts off as a very microscopic process. I think the theory for it is that you take certain types of cells from within a body, and use those as a sort of... <em>starter</em> for the lab-grown tissues to sprout from. Like... a seed, I suppose. It is not detrimental to plants--in most cases--to lose their seeds, and from the seed, you can grow a whole new plant. All while the original plant continues to live. I came straight here with Achoris after he explained things, so this <em>is</em> me poking around this idea for the first time. I briefly heard something about it years ago, but when I more casually looked into it then, it was through the lens of my flesh-shaping magics. Not flesh-<em>growing</em>. I&#39;ll need to look over things again with that goal in mind to retain more relevant information. But the idea is just that simple, on the surface, anyways; our bodies have special cells in them that are designed to essentially lay a blueprint of what grows where. If I take the cells of that variety which are programmed to grow lungs, for example, I can place them in an environment with specially designed stimuli and conditions, and they will grow lungs despite not being in a body. The cell doesn&#39;t know any different. And the resulting lung will be identical to that within you or I, but will have never been a part of a living person&#39;s bodily growth--with the exception of those tiny cells that started it.&quot;

She was still leafing through the tome, looking for a specific chapter or something. It was very dense, and glimpses at the pages flipping by showed the occasional monochrome diagram, but otherwise just... walls and walls of mind-numbing texts. &quot;The caveat, of course, is sourcing that original cell. However, I have specimens in my workshop right now that would do the trick. No lives need to be lost that aren&#39;t already long gone. Do you have a particular organ or cut of muscle that you find preferable, Achoris?&quot; She added, glancing up at him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In theory, possibly, though the attaching of a lab-grown limb to a stump is where the process would get tricky, I imagine, as our bodies do not accept grafting as easily as, say, many plants do. Skin grafts are one thing; reattaching an entire limb would be a meticulous and risky process of aligning the blood vessels, nerves, bones, tendons... and with no guarantee that the host body will not reject it. I could also see cause for concern that blood flowing into a previously bloodless limb joined to it like that could be a recipe for immediate blood clots or something of that nature. Fortunately, there are spells that regrow lost limbs, which, I imagine, is why research into doing so scientifically is relatively moot. If you have the resources to lab-grow and surgically attach a limb, the idea that you would <em>not</em> have the resources to access the services of a powerful cleric or druid seems a bit odd,&quot; Skena mused, easily pulled off-topic.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In the meantime, Achoris... While Skena is trying to grow these samples, I do have various cuts of meat I&#39;ve acquired that we could try, if you are willing.&quot; He pulled out a slip of paper from his vest pocket and a pen, unfolding it to show it to him. &quot;And more from this list I could go out and acquire. I did some research, and everything on this list has DNA that is highly similar to humanoids. I&#39;ll just need you to cross out what you&#39;ve already tried.&quot;

Achoris pulled over the list, glancing over it.  He gestured for the pen, and began crossing out several lines. He blinked. &quot;<em>Bananas</em> share similar genes to humanoids?&quot;

&quot;About sixty percent,&quot; Luka said with a chuckle. &quot;And cattle about eighty percent, mice at eighty-five, cats at ninety.&quot;

&quot;Well, fortunately for Victoria, I&#39;ve already tried cat meat. No luck there.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Luka was trying his best, and Achoris was being a remarkably good sport, but she had no doubt that there was objectively no way that a diet that called for humanoid meat could be substituted with cats or bananas. That the ten percent of a genetic difference mattered deeply--and that the intention of a god&#39;s design mattered far, far more.

So instead, she tucked her nose down into her incredibly dense book, leafing around until she found what she was looking for. And then was interrupted by the appeasing little voice of the imp as he spoke up.

&quot;Szix begs forgiveness for speaking out of turn, truly, truly--but Szix cannot help but wonder--so curious a dilemma!! So much indeed, yes--does this <em>beautiful</em> Other of Significance, does he try to eat creatures that are not beast of the material plane?&quot; Szix asked tentatively. Hopefully.

&quot;He&#39;s trying to corrupt you,&quot; Skena murmured without looking up from her book. &quot;He&#39;s not offering for the sake of getting you the answer that helps you most, he&#39;s offering because you killing and eating the pegasus that followed the Valehunters home recently would be the easiest way to start dragging your soul towards Hell.&quot;

No! No, wait, no!!&quot; Szix squealed, holding his hands out reassuringly towards Luka. &quot;No, niece is wrong!! Szix would never! Szix merely thinks--Other of Significance (beautiful) has tried much meat from material plane, but there is so much more!! And Szix thinks of his own preference! Of--Of--<em>Anecdotal Evidence!</em> Szix has always found celestial meat to taste far superior!! It&#39;s true!! The truth!! Always!&quot;

Skena did look up then, not towards the imp, but towards her uncle, waiting until the imp had pled his case, before calmly answering Achoris. &quot;In short, yes. He&#39;s presumably referring to proper celestial entities, not humanoids with celestial influence such as you or I--though I&#39;m sure he&#39;d consider it a net gain if you ate me. It&#39;s typically considered <em>wrong</em> to kill a true celestial creature, as they are not common to find on the material plane, and needless to say, the goodness in their nature makes the idea of slaying them feel sacrilegious, regardless of one&#39;s personal beliefs. In a similar vein, those who are the least evil or the least fiendish make for the heftiest prizes if a fiend is able to commit their soul to Hell. And since souls are the currency of Hell, this particular imp just sees, effectively, a fat paycheck when he looks at you, being descended from a celestial and carrying that influence in your blood. Combine those two ideas, and he has much to gain from convincing you--partially celestial yourself, which I imagine is just bonus points--to sin against nature in such a way as slaying an innocent creature of pure goodness, and then consuming their flesh. I have absolutely no reason to believe pegasus meat would do <em>anything</em> for you that standard beef does not.&quot;

Szix looked absolutely <em>devastated</em> by this indirect roasting. In fact, he looked a bit wobbly in the lip. How does one defend themselves against such an unyielding dictation? Big, perhaps somewhat watery eyes pled with Luka a moment more, before he dropped his gaze miserably. 

&quot;Szix means no harm... Szix only means to help. Szix did not help. Szix will mind Szix&#39;s tongue in the future...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure the meat of a celestial creature probably does taste delectable,&quot; Skena mused, wholly unfazed by the teary imp whom she had crushed on a spiritual level. &quot;But lies are most potent when they are sprinkled with grains of truth.&quot; She shrugged, glancing over to Luka. &quot;... Fortunately, I don&#39;t think he could actually corrupt you, regardless of whatever lies or manipulation he spun up. If the person you love can&#39;t even sway your morals with their biological requirements, this little one is in an exercise in futility. Not that he knows how to quit.&quot;

Szix was slinking away, tail and wings dragging across the tabletop, as if Skena&#39;s words had been the nastiest of vitriol stabbed into his back, making him feel shatteringly unwelcome. Unloved. Useless.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Luka winced at Skena&#39;s words, wilting a bit himself. Probably feeling as though he <em>should</em> probably have let his morals be swayed by Achoris&#39; needs. Guilt settled in, but still that want to comfort the imp&#39;s distress led him to reach out and gently touch Szix&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I understand you&#39;re acting in accordance with your nature, but I need to ask you to try to reign in those tendencies in the future. You did make a good point in suggesting creatures from other planes. It might be worth trying, just to say the attempt was made.&quot;

He paused, then furrowed his brow as he looked to Achoris and Skena. &quot;...Could you simply <em>ask</em> Set?&quot;

&quot;I could,&quot; Achoris said, &quot;though I honestly doubt I&#39;d get a straight answer. And I&#39;m quite certain the answer is &#39;no,&#39; anyway. It wouldn&#39;t make sense to create a child with a specific dietary requirement that he couldn&#39;t even access on his own plane of existence. He&#39;s chaotic, but He&#39;s not impossible.&quot;

&quot;Mmh.. Good point,&quot; Luka said with a nod.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

If it was a contest, you&#39;d win against every other person on this planet. I don&#39;t mean to imply you should compromise your boundaries and virtues. Not at all. Forgive me if I spoke as though I felt otherwise. I only meant to nod towards said immensely strong morals in regards to how much this imp is wasting his time.&quot; She snorted a little. &quot;Though as much as his time is wasted, it&#39;ll just captivate him more to keep trying. The effort he makes and wastes on corrupting you is just further proof that you&#39;re worth even more ongoing, tireless efforts; easy corruptions are cheaper corruptions. So you can expect this to be a lifelong issue.&quot;

Szix bonelessly buckled down onto the table as Luka&#39;s hand found his shoulder, as if Skena&#39;s words had pummeled him down into the wooden surface. Just deflated in absolute, abject misery. &quot;Szix is so sorrryyyy,&quot; he whined pitifully. &quot;Szix only tries to helpppppp... Szix ruined <em>everythingggg</em>--&quot;

Skena, despite her usual bleeding heart nature, was entirely unmoved by the melodrama, tilting her head thoughtfully at mention of Set. &quot;... I would offer to use my magic to divine an answer, but that answer would be coming from Anubis, not Set. And I have a feeling the answer from Anubis would be to the effect of: <em>I have no idea what my father was doing or what His intentions were, the last time we had a proper conversation, He came at me with a hot poker</em>, etcetera.&quot; She shrugged. 

&quot;... But... you could try to drink that tea that helped us do that joint dream...? Assuming the tea even mattered in that case.&quot; She was careful to not expand upon the tea&#39;s ingredients. Achoris&#39; fast could start after that endeavor, in that case. &quot;My arcane disciplines give me more access to talk to my father than you have, but I don&#39;t... know a very good way to lend you that boon. Otherwise I would.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I can make you some hot chocolate, and you could work on trying out that crochet pattern I was teaching you earlier. You&#39;ve been catching on very well with that.&quot;

The look Achoris gave Luka was helplessly fond, despite his exasperation and bitterness over what he was going to be going through. But he turned his gaze back to Skena and gave a little shake of his head. &quot;I&#39;ll bring up the question the next time Father visits my dreams, but I&#39;m not going to go out of my way to prod Him about it.&quot; Mostly because it honestly didn&#39;t matter to him.

Skena nodded, picking up on Achoris&#39; lack of concern over getting Set&#39;s direct opinion. She didn&#39;t know Set personally, but she would have bet all her gold on what His answer would be, anyways. &quot;There are, also, humanoids from other planes. Your friends Ilex and Cassiana come to mind; there are plenty of eladrin who live in the Feywild, and shadar-kai who reside in the Shadowfell. Those planes are far closer to our own than the outer planes where celestials and fiends hail from. Which is just to say: the literal answer might be that yes, extraplanar creatures could sate you. But that doesn&#39;t actually solve this issue, because--well, you know eladrin sates you. At the <em>very</em> least, eladrin fingers did. So that would be a large fuss that would just lead us back to where we started.&quot;

She shook her head. &quot;The reason my first suggestion was lab-grown meat from humanoid stem cells is because it simply makes the most sense to me. And I don&#39;t think you can get a more perfect answer than that. I&#39;ve tried alternatives to sugar, and even when the difference is indistinguishable to Kaleva, it does nothing to fill me, so I&#39;m not holding my breath that there&#39;s just some food he somehow hasn&#39;t tried. If there&#39;s any hope that he can have a murder-free diet, I would think it would be recreating cell-for-cell what he is eating without having to harvest it from a once-living body. And... I&#39;ll try my best to do that as quickly as possible.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Remember when I said that Ilex helped me escape the drow that kept us as pets? He sacrificed his fingers so that I could regain my strength enough to help fight her,&quot; Achoris said with a nonchalant shrug.

Luka&#39;s mouth opened and closed a couple of times. &quot;That&#39;s... Oh. That was... &#39;kind&#39; doesn&#39;t really cover the sentiment, does it?&quot;

&quot;It was generous of him,&quot; Achoris agreed. &quot;Particularly because he didn&#39;t exactly mind his own position there. But he saw that others <em>did</em> mind, that others suffered under her rule.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She paused as there was a thump, glancing over to where the imp--not getting sufficient attention and consolation--had rolled off the table to land face-first on the ground, heaving a weary sigh of misery. She then turned her attention back to the two adults.

&quot;Well... I should get to work, then. I don&#39;t know how long this is going to take me, and... if Achoris won&#39;t be eating for the duration, I want to be quick.

Achoris reached over and scuffed Skena&#39;s hair affectionately. &quot;If I get hungry enough, I can always eat Szix. He looks about ready to give up on life anyway.&quot;

Skena snorted, shoving her book back in her bag and getting to her feet. &quot;Good luck, you two. I&#39;ll do my best.&quot; She gave a look to Achoris that lingered a bit longer than it had towards Luka, a subtle, unspoken understanding of what these days--perhaps even weeks--would mean for him. What he was resigning himself to in the interest of trying to appease the man he loved. And she respected him for it, deeply--though she regretted how he would suffer in that endeavor just as deeply.

Looking around a moment, she found Gummy rooting around in Luka&#39;s trash (of course the man didn&#39;t keep dead things lying around to interest him, so the little idiot&#39;s options were slim), plucking him out and emptying his gut of whatever he had confiscated, before wishing the two men a good evening and scurrying off to get to work.

When she arrived home, she unburdened herself of bag, books, and minion, heaving a heavy sigh. &quot;... Kaleva? I&#39;m home. Are you around?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The huskies were out in the snow, refusing to come inside, while the cautican hounds were both laying in front of the fire to soak in the warmth. Atreyu wagged his tail and got up to greet Skena, nosing her and letting out a whimper of greeting.

But then he&#39;ll be back, I promise. I&#39;ll let you know when he&#39;s coming home,&quot; she reassured, giving Atreyu a final pat. &quot;Go back over there and get warm again. Here.&quot;

Pulling a throw blanket off the couch, she waited until Atreyu had laid back down, and then gently draped it over both desert dogs. &quot;That&#39;s cozy, right? That should help.&quot;

With that, she headed after Kaleva&#39;s voice, unfazed by his being in the bath, since the door was open--which she took for the willingness for an audience that it was. While she gave him privacy in the sense of not staring directly at him, she had an almost uncharacteristic lack of modesty about being in the shared space with him while he was naked, but one that came from many comfortable years of just... being extensions of one another, and having never known each other as strangers. 

She sank down to sit on the floor, her back against the wall, as she heaved a sigh. &quot;Luka knows Achoris is a cannibal. It&#39;s upsetting to him, but... he wants to explore options. He clearly still loves Achoris and wants things to work out. Luka is hopelessly optimistic that if we just try hard enough, there has got to be some alternative out there that will sate Achoris the way humanoid meat does,&quot; she recapped, sounding tired. &quot;Achoris and I both know thats not going to happen. It doesn&#39;t make logical sense that Set would create his diet intentionally as it is, but also create a less problematic loophole. I&#39;m convinced Set&#39;s penchant for chaos is what brought about the diet in the first place, so it would be antithetical to give it a less chaotic alternative. But Achoris is... he&#39;s being an incredible sport about it. He clearly loves Luka, too. So even though we both know the answer to this question, he&#39;s willing to not eat humanoid meat for a period while Luka tries out several alternative options. When Achoris told me, I immediately wanted to be involved, because he&#39;s going to be <em>absolutely miserable</em> and potentially suffer real health problems as he wastes away, and... more than that, I feel uniquely qualified to help make this period as efficient as possible. So I just went over and talked to them, and I&#39;m going to try to lab-grow meat from humanoid stem cells. It will be molecularly identical to humanoid meat, but it will not have been harvested from a once-living creature. But... I still don&#39;t have a lot of confidence it will sate him. But if that fails, then Luka will be confident that was our best possible effort, which means Achoris doesn&#39;t have to keep starving beyond that.&quot;

She raked her fingers through her hair slowly. &quot;... And... I&#39;m going to fast from sugar while this is happening. So I know, no matter how Achoris acts or what he tells me to do, when he&#39;s at a point where he can&#39;t take it any longer. Because I&#39;ll be at that point too. And then I can pull the plug and make sure he doesn&#39;t get seriously hurt, even if Luka&#39;s not satisfied yet.&quot;

Tiredly, her alien-looking eyes slid over to Kaleva (his nudity shielded due to her angle now being seated on the floor and the wall of the tub). &quot;... So that&#39;s been my day. How are you?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I don&#39;t want Luka to beat himself up with guilt or anything, I just... he seemed to feel a little guilty at one point, as though I had implied to him that he should be compromising his morals. I didn&#39;t mean to imply that, and I don&#39;t believe that. His morals are fine. If he was the one who needed to cannibalize, I imagine he would live his whole live in atrophy and hunger instead and be content with that. And that would be his decision to make and there would be nothing wrong with it. But if he can&#39;t stand that Achoris does not hold that same structure of morals, the solution isn&#39;t for one of them to <em>compromise</em>, the solution is that they need to find a way to either coexist without those things coming into contact with Luka&#39;s realm of awareness, or... gods. I sound so jaded. Maybe they just aren&#39;t a good fit, then, if this isn&#39;t something that can be moved past without someone grievously compromising their boundaries.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I can&#39;t help but wonder if there&#39;s a tiny part of him that has some sort of brotherly protectiveness, but who knows.

I can just see what the thought process probably was. When that happened, my impression was that primarily Val wanted to know if Achoris had maliciously deceived Luka or if there was an innocent explanation. It seemed like she was trying to gauge just how much of the enemy Achoris was. And I think the outcome would have probably been far nastier and bloodier if she believed Achoris really was just bold-faced lying to Luka in a way that resulted in him being devastated. Because that would have constituted some very heartless cheating. While I can understand that series of thoughts, choices, and conclusions, how she handled it was still egregiously wrong. But my point is just that I could understand that her motive was ascertaining the nature of the deceit, and then potentially seeking vengeance for the harm caused. That Achoris walked away unscathed, with none of her threats having been acted upon, tells me she was either bluffing on them--which feels like a dangerous assumption to make, given the demi-god she carries around like a handbag--or she didn&#39;t find sufficient harm done to warrant vengeance. And in <em>that</em> case... I don&#39;t think an amicable breakup, even one that depresses Luka, would make her lash out at Achoris. Valentine acted unreasonably, but not... <em>entirely</em> unreasonably. Like she had a threshold of reasonability that she did not cross, it&#39;s just not where you or I place ours. She wasn&#39;t going to outright attack Achoris until she absolutely knew he, by her metric, deserved it. And them potentially determining they just aren&#39;t compatible for a proper relationship but still wanting to remain friends is a <em>far</em> lesser offense than alleged bold-faced cheating.&quot;

By the time she finished her little ramble, she had also finished the braid, the appearance of which making it look like she had added several inches more to the length of Kaleva&#39;s tail with the similarly tail-like extension that now trailed off the tip.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A teacup was towards the end of the table with a little bit of black coffee in it, but seemed largely untouched. Various textbooks were scattered around her, and immediately in front of her were some jars of various substances, a collection of metal instruments Kaleva would recognize--more or less--as things commonly seen in her hand during dissections, and a jar containing what looked like a little fetus, likely no more than a few weeks in age, of some elven or otherwise standard humanoid nature floating in a clear liquid. She was currently hunched over a small, shallow glass dish, its bottom lined with a pale jelly-like substance, and a little blob of something vaguely visceral at its center, a little smaller than a gold coin in size. Despite how much of a professional she had the capacity to be, the way her legs were folded against her chest and a mass of wrinkly blanket enshrouded her as she crouched over this focal point added a subtle theme of chaos to the scene.

She looked up at Kaleva a bit blearily as he came through the doorway, blinking slowly, before looking back down at the little dish.

The next couple days carried on in a similar fashion, though she at least righted her sleep schedule. At first, it just seemed like a biproduct of her having pulled that all-nighter (draining her lifeforce during it, no less), but as the day stretched into a good week or so, she never quite seemed to recover her energy. She was sluggish and lower-energy than usual, seeming to just be mindlessly devoted to the task at hand without sparing much effort for more pleasant pursuits. Even her involvement with the dogs waned; there was still affection there, but even when she was forcing herself away from her work, she just didn&#39;t seem to have the capacity to really play with the dogs or do much more than give them quiet little scritches. 

She was suffering with dignity, but she was still suffering. A day or two without sugar had been unpleasant, like she just had an incurable case of the munchies. On the third day, the hunger pains started to kick in. Not the same as when her corporeal stomach was empty, but a feeling more existentially hollow and aching. It wasn&#39;t something she had felt since being a toddler, and she barely remembered the experience from that time. It was a sobering reminder of exactly what experiences were far more readily available to Achoris&#39; memory.

But she was glad she was fasting. She knew Achoris was in pain by then, too, but even being relatively new to the experience herself, she knew she didn&#39;t need to tap out just yet. Achoris was far more accustomed to this feeling; he probably felt the same.

But day three became day five. Then day eight. The changes were becoming visible, with the tiny aasimar looking far more gaunt and sickly than usual, and often moving like she was somewhat lightheaded. The bright side was that this grueling lifeforce-draining regimen helped her dial in on how to channel said lifeforce the most efficiently, allowing her to maintain her pace without expediting her own atrophy too notably. But even with that gained efficiency, she rarely had the capacity left over at the end of the day to magically send her uncle a message. 

However, by the end of that first week, she <em>did</em> have a humanoid heart, a bit smaller than the size of her fist. 

She called it quits for the day a bit earlier than she usually did, scraping together what was left of her magic to instead utilize one of those rarer-than-she-had-intended messages to her uncle. Her voice in his mind was soft and tired.

<em>&#39;I have something. Enough. If you still have a point to prove, though... I can grow it another week.&#39;</em> She didn&#39;t sound judgmental at all. She understood. She was committed to this ordeal to whatever extent he was. <em>&#39;... But can&#39;t message back after this.&#39;</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Luka had been there for him, relentlessly going through the list and preparing him meals with the meats that shared a close genetic code with humanoids, but each one struck out. And Achoris had borne it with patience, but that patience grew thinner the more his hunger gnawed at him, the more tired he got, and the more he started to waste away.

At Skena&#39;s message, Achoris considered his response, and finally sent, <em>&#39;Grow it. It hasn&#39;t sunk in enough yet for him.&#39;</em>

He hadn&#39;t deteriorated far enough yet.

But five days later, Achoris was feeling like a zombie. He barely had the strength to walk, to move around. He watched Luka hungrily, twitched at his touch, at his proximity and his smell. Luka had had to send Szix to stay with Valentine for his own safety until this experiment was concluded, and he was starting to look more and more worried.

Luka was speaking to him, but he couldn&#39;t make out the words. He just watched his lips move, the brief glide of a tongue on his lower lip, and Achoris&#39; mouth filled with saliva. His long black hair had turned stringy and dull, the vanta black pits of his eyes seeming even deeper from the dark circles and how gaunt his features had become. His rich brown skin had turned unhealthily pale.

Luka noticed, and his concern spiked as he reached out and gently took Achoris&#39; face in his hands, searching his gaze, and faced with the increasing realization that had been settling in that... this was his doing. His moral hangups had brought this on, and Achoris was deteriorating because of him.

&quot;...That&#39;s enough,&quot; he decided with a whisper, tears in his eyes. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sorry I drove you to this point. I&#39;ll have Valentine call Skena and have her bring you something to eat.&quot; He leaned in to press a gentle kiss to his lips...

Achoris wasn&#39;t even aware of his own actions, too consumed by hunger to fully register. He just felt warm flesh pressed to his lips, and snapped like a viper, clamping down on Luka&#39;s lips with his teeth and ripping at them. Luka screamed, muffled under his mouth, and tried to push him off as he fell beneath the ravenous aasimar, who got a taste of blood and ripped off a good chunk of luka&#39;s lips and cheek, staggering back as Luka kicked him in the sternum and scrambled out from beneath him, barely feeling the blow as he gulped down the raw meat.

Luka scrambled away, a hand cupped to his face as blood poured down his front, eyes wide with terror and pain as he gasped for breath. But Achoris wasn&#39;t pursuing him, was instead licking the blood from his hands, and so he shakily grabbed for a dishtowel to press to his lower face and thumbed his ring, backing into the bedroom and closing the door, pressing his back against it and sinking down to the floor, shaking with terrified sobs.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Achoris came to himself eventually, like crawling out of a pool of molasses, the delicious taste of blood and meat lingering in his mouth, not enough, but a glass of cold water in the middle of a desert.

He sat himself down at the kitchen table and buried his head in his hands, closing his eyes.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The missing chunk of his cheek wasn&#39;t too hard to heal to be filled in again--though it took some energy. It was the missing chunk of lip that gave her trouble. &quot;... Kaleva...? Can you... hand me my bag...&quot;

If the bag was brought to her, she&#39;d pause her magic to clumsily rifle around in it until she produced a small tin box. Inside this box was a hook-shaped needle, and an odd-looking spool of thread that certainly did not look akin to that used in tailoring. 

&quot;Little pinches, but nothing too bad, I promise...&quot; She murmured, her bedside manner a little more... stoned? drunk? than usual. It took her a bit longer than it otherwise would have to thread the needle, and she had to take her time in actually using it on his face so her present clumsiness didn&#39;t cause problems, but as long as he was able to tough it out, it wouldn&#39;t be terribly long before she had closed up the rest of what her magic struggled to seal with a row of small, neat stitches, creating a line up where his lip had been split.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Fastest food delivery on the continent. You should consider making it a full time job. Call it Doggy Bag Delivery.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re emotional support cookies, it&#39;s more comforting that they be there,&quot; Achoris said sagely with a nod. He fell quiet at the sound of footsteps, turning his head slightly toward where Luka tentatively approached.

Luka had changed into an unbloodied shirt, blood cleaned from his skin and hair, which still hung in wet little ringlets. He was hugging himself, shaking, but quietly approached Achoris and knelt down next to where he sat, on the opposite side of where Skena was situated.

&quot;...Pressuring you into this wasn&#39;t unlike what I did to Jaska, was it...? Only this time, I saw the suffering and deterioration with my own eyes, and I still...&quot;

He fell silent as Achoris tucked fingers under his chin and lifted his teary-eyed face, inspecting the stitches trailing up from his upper lip. Achoris thumbed at his lower lip lightly. &quot;I could have cut it off at any time. It was more important to me that you understood.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Luka whispered tremulously. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re forgiven. Will I be expecting your siblings to come after me for what I&#39;ve done to your face?&quot;

Luka shook his head at that. &quot;I will forbid it. I brought it upon myself.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Setting the candy bag aside momentarily, she leaned over to fumble for her bag, gracelessly messing with it until she produced the glass jar with--yep, an adult-sized humanoid heart just slouched against the glass inside. 

&quot;... If I was a gambler,&quot; she murmured, eyeing over the organ a moment, &quot;I&#39;d bet that this... doesn&#39;t do the same thing for you. As... As the real thing. But if... if it doesn&#39;t, then... at least you know that the... whatever gives you nutrients, it&#39;s more about what Set&#39;s intentions were. Maybe... something to do with... how the meat had to have known life. At some point. Maybe. I don&#39;t know.&quot;

She weakly offered the jar to Achoris, having to use both hands to hoist it so her grip didn&#39;t slip. &quot;Kaleva says it smells more sterile than the real thing. But it&#39;s... I mean. It hasn&#39;t been... <em>marinating</em> in viscera, and... it&#39;s probably not warm, but... it&#39;s structurally and cell... cellular... cellularlaly... identical. Cellulully...

&quot;Do you, um...&quot; Luka trailed off as he looked at the heart in the jar, then to Achoris. &quot;...Do you want... me to cook it?&quot; That&#39;s what had started this whole thing. He just... wanted to cook a meal that Achoris would actually enjoy. And this was probably the first and last time he&#39;d get that opportunity.

At least with something he didn&#39;t feel bad about.

Achoris studied him with a tilt of his head, then offered a small smile, holding the jar out to him. Luka took it and turned to set it on the counter, opening a recipe book and flipping through it until he decided on one, and went into his pantry to fetch some veggies, cooking wine, and beef broth.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her eyes slid to follow Luka as he took the heart and went about beginning to cook it, a soft smile on her face as she exchanged a glance with Kaleva. For all the man’s na&#239;vet&#233;, how problematic and even harmful that could be… he really was so wholesome and pure. It hadn’t even been an hour since his partner had literally ripped off and ate a piece of his face, and he wanted nothing more than the opportunity to just cook the meal he’d wanted to provide for that same partner. 

“… I think I’ve… more or less figured out the growing process,” she murmured. “If that’s any good, Achoris… I can start setting up a steady supply. Maybe not… I don’t know. Probably couldn’t supply all your food like that… it’s slow and… the more I rush it, the more it takes out of me… but I could have some on hand. For emergencies.

&quot;If it works, it might not hurt to have some on hand for emergencies,&quot; Achoris replied, watching Luka as he took the heart from the jar and washed it in the sink, patting it dry and then slicing it in half, and then into half inch slices while a cast iron skillet warmed up on the stove. The slices were then coated in flour, salt, and pepper. &quot;Could keep it frozen for a good, long while. Even if I&#39;m not in Fielbarry, it&#39;d be an easy thing to use the chests to request some of it get sent to me.&quot;

He closed his eyes and let his head tip back, the long strands of inky hair nearly brushing the floor where they hung over the back of the chair. &quot;...The first couple of weeks are the worst.

Another victim of his moral high ground.

He swallowed and turned back to preparing the food, trying to keep himself from crying, from drowning in the shame and the guilt, and quietly went to melt butter in the skillet and start frying up the strips of meat.

&quot;None of them really had any idea how aasimar work,&quot; Achoris muttered, eyes still closed as he slouched in his chair. &quot;Breast milk sustained me for the first year or so. Apparently it was really hard to get me to transition from the wet nurse. I refused cow or goat&#39;s milk. But once my teeth came in I would bite the wet nurse bloody, practically chew on her.&quot;

Kaleva raised a brow at Achoris. &quot;So breast milk is a sustainable option?&quot;

&quot;It certainly wasn&#39;t for all my years of banishment, and it&#39;d look decidedly odd for me to go about trying to get access to any now... No. I don&#39;t want to live the rest of my days on breast milk. I&#39;d rather be known as an obligate cannibal than some fetishistic freak who still wears diapers and suckles from the teat or a bottle.&quot;

&quot;<em>Fetishistic--</em>&quot; Kaleva spluttered. &quot;Do... do people actually--&quot;

&quot;Yes, and let&#39;s not talk about it further or my appetite is going to be ruined.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She was still the least knowledgeable in the room, though (depending on where Luka fell in his ignorance or lack thereof). But for once, she could be in the same boat as her non-virgin friend who <em>also</em> was blindsided by something weird and perverse existing. 

She should really do something about her own ignorance.

She was also a little too out of it to think too long on the idea of ageplay fetishes, instead willfully abandoning that oddity and glancing--almost involuntarily--at Luka to see if he was shocked or not. But instead, she saw a man biting back tears.

Skena was quiet a moment, the more scandalous topic quickly being forgotten. Silence stretched over the room for a few long seconds, before she piped up out of nowhere, &quot;... No one here thinks you&#39;re a bad person, Luka.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

You and I would have been... practically indistinguishable as kids, I think. I... worked with death, but... the idea of <em>harming</em> something living... I could never stomach it. I grew up privileged... on a pedestal, but... privileged. I grew up surrounded by this idea that... that the world was a good place. That... virtue and compassion and charity all prevailed at the end of every story. I would go... take food to the people living on the streets, because... I saw pain in my home, and I wanted to make it go away. I used to think it was... just that simple, just... if everyone could bring them some food, or... give them a place to stay, all would be right in the world. That was all that was out of line. That&#39;s where I met Kaleva. He had been beaten and... had some broken bones, even... because he had resorted to stealing food so he didn&#39;t starve, and got caught. I healed him and offered to let him stay with me. Offered to feed him. It... wasn&#39;t even something I had to... contemplate, really, that just... that was the only natural response that I thought could <em>ever</em> come after that introduction. Because that&#39;s... that&#39;s all that was out of line, right? And... such an easy fix, for someone of privilege to... lend some of that privilege to those who need it.&quot; She shrugged a little.

&quot;... I don&#39;t think... I would do the same thing today. I would heal that person, but... I know better than to just... invite strangers into my home. I owe everything in my life right now to... having made that decision then. I was lucky... it was the right decision. But now I know that... it often would not have been. I know that what was wrong with my home was not... just some people needing a little extra food... or a place to sleep. There&#39;s... a cancer there, that&#39;s deep and systemic and... overwhelming to consider addressing. And I... I tried, Luka. I did everything in my power to dismantle it once I saw it for what it was. And nothing changed. And... Achoris wants to go back. To join forces with me and... together, try to fix it. He wants to purge the city in holy fire. And... I&#39;ve... cried, a lot, because... I don&#39;t want to hurt those people. Even the ones who hurt me the most.

I&#39;m... haunted by the people I have killed,&quot; she added, barely above a whisper. &quot;I... don&#39;t even like <em>hurting</em> anyone, whether it kills them or not. And when Jaska needs replenishing of his lifeforce, I take that lifeforce out of my own body to give it to him, and it&#39;s... it&#39;s excruciating. But...

&quot;... I don&#39;t share Achoris&#39; values. Or his... boundaries. The things that... thrill him, I usually want nothing to do with. But... the gods gave us free will for a reason. If... If even the gods will not step in to correct behavior they deem <em>bad</em>... why should <em>I</em>, an equally flawed mortal, try to do that? Something may make me uncomfortable, or <em>seem</em> very much to be &#39;wrong&#39;, but--how can I possibly be the authority on that? No matter... how much I try to do the right thing... right and wrong... good and evil... it&#39;s all purely subjective. I&#39;m... the daughter of the god of judgment, but... all that&#39;s taught me is that it&#39;s not <em>my</em> job to judge others. It&#39;s His. I&#39;m not supposed to have the right answers; He does. And He&#39;s... really good at His job,&quot; she added with a weak smile.

She let out a long breath. &quot;... What I&#39;m... trying to say is that... what I watched you do in all this is just... apply the same morals you&#39;ve known all your life to this new situation... the way you probably have applied them to everything else. And... many times, that&#39;s a good fit. You&#39;ve only ever known a life where... it was the <em>right</em> thing to do for you to... to martyr yourself for a greater good. That&#39;s... what you thought you were doing with Jaska. You didn&#39;t realize you were actually martyring <em>someone else</em>--someone who didn&#39;t have that same set of morals, and didn&#39;t consent to bearing that suffering for some <em>greater good</em>... because what seemed like such a clear-cut matter of what was the greater good was not a perspective he agreed with, and it turned out to be just... your subjective opinion instead of the objective facts. And... it&#39;s kind of the same with Achoris. I don&#39;t think... you stopped to consider that... maybe he just doesn&#39;t share your morals. Maybe killing doesn&#39;t bother him. He has to kill to eat, and he has to eat to live, and he&#39;s decided that if that&#39;s always going to be true... he can either permanently feel guilty about it forever, or... he can choose to not waste time on mourning that which he cannot change. I&#39;ve... accepted that it&#39;s going to happen whether I get upset about it or not. I can&#39;t save those people without grievously hurting my uncle. If you saved every rabbit in the world, you commit genocide on all the predators who rely on their deaths for their own survival. I know people are supposed to be higher than animals, but... in Achoris&#39; case... in a case of obligate cannibalism... the analogy is not abstract.&quot; She gave him a little, sympathetic smile. &quot;I think the only thing that&#39;s <em>wrong</em> with you, if you can call it that... is that you want to save all the rabbits.&quot; A beat. &quot;Or imps. Which is... endearing and wholesome... but if you want to live that way... you have to do so with the understanding that there&#39;s no guarantee your approach is even the <em>right</em> one. Or the <em>good</em> one, that you should encourage others to also take. It&#39;s hard for us innately flawed mortals to claim a moral authority. Blind leading the blind and such. Maybe you and I are the degenerates, and the gods intended <em>everyone</em> to be cannibals.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It&#39;s like what happened with Szix. Axa had a tantrum and summoned the imps to take out her upset on. And I wasn&#39;t going to get involved, until one came and begged for my help. And if I were put in a situation where you were... Hunting, and I heard them cry for help... I couldn&#39;t stand by and do nothing. As much as I can have that understanding that it&#39;s something you need to do, I can&#39;t... It&#39;s a very important part of you I would not be able to embrace.&quot;

For all that Achoris had anticipated this, he still seemed to wilt. Quietly, and with dignity, but his shoulders slowly slumped. &quot;I understand. So, to be clear... We are breaking up?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Luka whispered. &quot;You... You deserve someone who can embrace all of you and everything you are. I just... I don&#39;t think I can be that person.&quot;

&quot;Love does not conquer all, and anyone who would say so has never truly had their love tested,&quot; Achoris said lowly, giving Luka a gentle squeeze. &quot;But I thank you for trying. And for being honest with yourself as much as with me.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A moment passed, before she softly piped up again. “You’re about to burn your carrots, Luka,” she whispered, not wanting to butt in, but also… not wanting him to ruin the dish he had wanted to make for Achoris.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But you&#39;re right, they should be finished now, thank you.&quot; He pulled away from Achoris and sniffled as he turned to the skillet, testing the softness of the vegetables and then pulling out a plate to arrange the meat and veggies artfully. He set it out for Achoris along with a glass of wine, and the aasimar chuckled as he took his seat. 

&quot;Not many people would cook someone a meal while breaking up with them,&quot; he mused, cutting a piece of the heart and spearing some veggies with it as he put it in his mouth.

&quot;Well, I... I mean, I like cooking for people,&quot; Luka said sheepishly. &quot;How does it taste?&quot;

Achoris chewed thoughtfully, brow furrowed in consideration. &quot;... It tastes good,&quot; he said slowly once he&#39;d swallowed it down. &quot;And it has that... Satisfaction that comes with knowing what I&#39;m eating will sustain me. But it does feel like something&#39;s missing from it. The meat is... Not quite right.&quot;

Luka didn&#39;t look hurt, thankfully, and turned up the unmarred corner of his mouth. &quot;So about what you suspected, then. It&#39;ll do the job, but it&#39;s not ideal.&quot;

&quot;Exactly. But I do thank you for the meal regardless.&quot; He took another bite, humming. &quot;Probably like being served a vegan burger when you were expecting beef.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;... Only... thing that I can think of that... would maybe cause that is if... it has something to do with lifeforce. I... poured a lot of my own into growing that. But a heart from a real body... it&#39;s been steeped in lifeforce for years. Decades.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And a quiet, jealous part of him felt that the two of them were closer than ever, while he...

He just kept screwing things up.

Not that it would get him anywhere anyway.

A short while later, Achoris had finished the food and Kaleva had washed the dishes and set them out to dry, and Luka came out with Achoris&#39; bag, passing it over to him. &quot;I think that&#39;s everything, but I&#39;ll let you know if I stumble across anything else.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;d be interested in still meeting up for tea every so often. Or perhaps another venture into Cusai to go hunting in the ruins,&quot; Achoris said as he shouldered the bag.

Luka blinked in surprise, and warmed a bit. &quot;I would love that, actually. And the ruins were so fascinating, I really would love to venture out there again to study them some more.&quot;

Achoris grinned at him and leaned down to kiss his cheek.

She slowly sank down to lay on the fur rug, rolling onto her back and staring up at the ceiling. &quot;You know Luka has been dating Achoris. Achoris is an aasimar, like me, and... I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true for all aasimar, but... for us at least, we have special foods we need to eat. If we are starved of specifically those foods and nothing else, we... probably won&#39;t <em>die</em>, but we do atrophy pretty bad. My food is sugar. I&#39;m lucky... sugar is an ingredient. And a common one. It&#39;s never really <em>completely</em> unavailable to me... though when I was homeless, it was a bit rough.&quot;

She sighed. &quot;Luka, being Luka, just wanted to be able to cook a meal for Achoris that he&#39;d actually enjoy after he learned of his dietary restrictions. Achoris kept dodging that issue this entire time, up until two weeks ago. When he finally told Luka that the only thing that really, truly sustains him is humanoid meat.&quot; She lifted a hand to point a finger at Jaska immediately. 

&quot;Remember, that&#39;s not actually leverage,&quot; she reminded tiredly. &quot;All it really does is make you two even, because I&#39;m an idiot and Achoris already knows about Axa. And now I&#39;m an idiot and you know about him. Mutually assured destruction, and I&#39;m still an idiot.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Luka wanted to explore everything and try to find <em>some</em> alternative. Thought… maybe he just hadn’t tried something that would sustain him the same, without requiring cannibalism. Achoris was being… a really good sport about it, humoring him. But when he was young, he spent the first eighteen or so years of his life emaciated and atrophied before he figured out what his diet was supposed to be, and… he was a Son of Divinity, in a temple like I was. His caretakers and mortal father did everything they could to find the right food. <em>Everything</em>. So… Achoris and I both knew that trying that again was futile. I offered to be involved, to try to help. Because… I knew it meant Achoris would be starving for however long it took Luka to be satisfied with the experiment. And I could help make the most of that time, and… also know when to call it off before he got hurt. I went with Achoris to talk to Luka at the start of his fast. I… explained to Luka that…” she sighed, rubbing her eyes.

“I tried to tell him. He was so fixated on no one having to die, he was willing to subject someone he loved to agonizing starvation. Luka pointed to how Achoris had survived those first eighteen years, saying it like that meant he could do it again. That he could live in that state of misery permanently. I… told him, explicitly, that he was asking Achoris to waste away when Achoris had no real desire to find a more morally agreeable alternative.” She shook her head slightly. “Luka was… tunnel visioned. And that’s… part of why I wanted to talk to you.”

Her head turned on the floor to look to Jaska properly. “… I didn’t know either of you when you shared a body. But it’s been… really hard to envision the Luka I know today just… willingly tormenting anyone else. All I could chock it up to was assuming he just must truly not have known you <em>weren’t</em> a facet of his own mind. But I… I think I get it now. He… is still my friend, I do care for him. But it’s… been… noteworthy to watch this unfold. To understand that deep flaw of his. His tendency to project his morals on others, to martyr others for what he considers the greater good to be, whether the person suffering subscribes to that greater good or not. And… for whatever it’s worth… he realized that too. When it was all over, one of the first things out of his mouth was your name. Realizing he’d done the same thing again. And I just… I guess I wanted to tell you I saw it too. I imagine… you’ve probably felt like the only person who sees him that way. And I can’t imagine how that feels.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His bifurcated tail switched sharply from side to side in stifled motions, and he took a deep breath, downed the rest of his drink, and straightened to set the empty glass down perhaps a little harder than necessary, picking the cigarette back up to smoke, the smell of cloves spreading through the room since it was too cold to open the window.

It probably said something, that he gave no hint of enjoyment of the tale of Achoris&#39; suffering at Luka&#39;s hands.

&quot;So what ended it? What had to happen for Luka to put a stop to it? Was it you?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I had offered to try lab-growing humanoid meat. If that didn&#39;t do the trick, I figured... nothing else would. It&#39;s... a slow process. But I had something substantial enough to take a good bite out of after a week. You... It might be... good context to have to know that... Luka didn&#39;t really <em>force</em> any of this to happen. He just... asked if Achoris would be willing to explore alternatives. Achoris is... stubborn and... maybe a little petty. And I... noticed a bit of bitterness when he was informing me of what was to happen. He could have told Luka no. Instead, he... thought it&#39;d be a more potent lesson if Luka saw what it did to him. When the end of the first week came, I sent him a message, told him I could be done now if he wanted to call it quits. He told me Luka still didn&#39;t get it, and to keep growing what I had for another week. He was in full control of that, but... wanted to prove his point. And I get it. After everything I explained to Luka... Achoris shouldn&#39;t have even been asked to go through with it, even if he wasn&#39;t forced to do so in any way.&quot; She shrugged a little.

&quot;... I look like a mess because... when Achoris told me this the first time, I decided to fast with him. So I&#39;d know how he was doing, because it&#39;s how I would be doing. After two weeks had passed... which was today... Valentine reached out to me to pass along a message from Luka that he wanted me to come over, and that the experiment was over. When Kaleva and I got there, Luka had locked himself in the bedroom because Achoris had bitten a chunk out of his face when Luka leaned in to kiss him. I healed him up, but... he&#39;ll probably have a scar. We brought Achoris his meat when we came, so we were able to... get him out of that place.&quot;

She made a bit of a face. &quot;... I&#39;m sure Valentine is gonna be mad. But Luka exclusively insisted that it was his fault, that he planned to impress that upon her. They&#39;re probably talking now, I imagine. Or will be soon. You probably know about this before your sister does.&quot; She shook her head a little. 

&quot;Luka was a mess. He realized what he&#39;d done, and... he broke up with Achoris, because he knew he would never be comfortable with it, and knew Achoris deserved someone who could be. It doesn&#39;t seem like there are any hard feelings between them... he cooked Achoris a meal with the meat I&#39;d grown before we left.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But she was his friend. One of very few.

&quot;I had begun to think he might have actually changed. That he truly did understand and regret what he put me through, that he was honest in his desire to make up for it in whatever way possible. Now I see it for what it was: pretty words from a man whose charisma has been his greatest defense in getting him out of trouble. This proves that he still hasn&#39;t learned, still doesn&#39;t understand. And he broke up with Achoris on top of it all, because his precious morals, his selfishness, is still more important to him than anything and anyone else. He is weak, a sniveling and pathetic spineless little worm, and the only way he can deal with that is to put himself on a pedestal and take the moral high ground.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But... who&#39;s to say my perspective is the right one?&quot; She added, offering a weak smile that didn&#39;t quite reach her eyes, and faded soon after.

&quot;I do at least see the same behavior that caused your traumas, when it was hard to envision before. I... I&#39;ve never really been someone who&#39;s easily manipulated by people with charisma, I... don&#39;t think,&quot; she continued slowly, squinting in thought. &quot;I... haven&#39;t been friendly with him just because he&#39;s seemed super pure and wholesome. I think I just... saw myself in him. Or... a version of myself that... didn&#39;t have a lot of the experience I&#39;ve had that set us apart. Luka&#39;s... had a weird life. A lot of... unusual stuff has been thrown on him to... figure out how to deal with. But... prior to those things... it sounds like he had a very modest, simple life. One where Valentine sheltered him. I don&#39;t think... he ever really had the tools to know how to handle the weird stuff. Naive is the word that always comes up. Stuff like this... reminds me of... someone much younger... like Anybody, who thinks the world is a little bit more poetic and wonderful than it is. Still enchanted by the thought that all stories have a happy ending. That everyone should be a &#39;good&#39; person. Then, when... suddenly he&#39;s got a really unexpected and weird issue in his lap to handle. And nothing in his life prior to that would have prepared him for suspecting professionals of being willfully abusive. Of taking advantage of him. Nothing would have prepared him for people who lie so deeply--or people who need to kill other people to survive. And... it feels like he tries to take those naive and... insufficient tools he has, and use them to fix bigger, far more nuanced issues that don&#39;t have a clean, wholesome resolution...&quot;

She squinted, looking up at Jaska. &quot;... I guess... I&#39;m curious how you feel about that impression? You&#39;ve... known him longer, and... in ways I never will. I&#39;m... not saying my observations are right, not at all. That&#39;s what I see when I look at him, but... that doesn&#39;t mean I think that to be the absolute truth of the matter. I just... I want to be clear this is all... a question. Not a counter-argument. How you feel, I think... regardless of if I fully agree or not... it&#39;s completely valid and warranted.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Oberon. The name I gave you, the... leverage over me. I... I never want to see him again. The idea of him finding me is... my absolute worst nightmare. Achoris tried to... entice me to go back with this... idea that I could have <em>vengeance</em>. I told him I didn&#39;t want that. I didn&#39;t want Oberon dead. I wanted Achoris to swear to me that... if he went back by himself, he wouldn&#39;t kill Oberon. He... still has never explicitly... given me his word on that. And it makes me sick to my stomach. If... If they were in front of me, and... Achoris tried to kill him... I&#39;d fight Achoris off. I... I can&#39;t control who Achoris kills or... what vengeance of his own he enacts, but... I... want to protect the people I know. Even if they haunt me. It... feels like Luka with that imp. It can only ever really... try to cause problems for him, but... it looked at him, spoke to him, showed him it had an individuality and... that was it, he couldn&#39;t bear to watch this objectively evil creature die, just because he could suddenly relate to it.&quot;

She rubbed her arm a little, shaking her head slightly. &quot;... I... don&#39;t blame you for being annoyed with that. I&#39;m the holdup for Achoris. Even... Kaleva, I think, is more inclined towards vengeance. If... If I was happy to go, I think Kaleva would have no reservations about joining in. I&#39;m the reason they don&#39;t get that satisfaction. Or closure. Because I just... can&#39;t stand the idea of awful, <em>awful</em> people who occupy my nightmares... getting hurt. That... That halfling woman that went to dig up dirt on me at your instruction... she&#39;s alive because of me. Achoris ate her arm before we got there. Once we were there... we protected her from him. I gave her a large sum of gold, and we set her up somewhere she&#39;d be safe. Achoris was so hungry, he had been planning on that catch to feed himself. But I couldn&#39;t just walk away from someone who was begging for my help and leave them to die. So... So Achoris stayed hungry for a while longer. Because I...&quot;

She actually looked on the verge of tears now. &quot;... How am I different from Luka? All those things you hate about him... are true for me, too.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That it&#39;s time to set aside your silly distractions. He has a knife to Kaleva&#39;s throat. He&#39;s going to kill him.

Clearly she had deliberately avoided thinking down this hypothetical thus far. 

&quot;... I would kill him,&quot; she finally relented, her words quiet and pitiful. &quot;... And it would haunt me forever. I would wish forever that I hadn&#39;t. I would hate myself for it. I would... have nightmares about it like I do Ahmes. I... would never regret saving Kaleva, but... I would be... torn apart wanting there to have been another way.&quot;

She lifted her gaze to tiredly, miserably meet Jaska&#39;s. &quot;... You don&#39;t think the same is true for Luka? That if backed into a corner, where his only options were to kill someone or else watch a loved one die at their hands, you don&#39;t think he&#39;d pull the trigger? And then... spend the rest of his life haunted at what he&#39;d done? That... That man that tried to shoot Axa when she was with him. I saw his body. It wasn&#39;t much, but... there was blood coming out of his nose and eyes. Axa putting a bolt through his forehead didn&#39;t do that. I... Maybe you know something I don&#39;t, but... I&#39;ve never known Axa to inflict psychic harm on anyone. It... certainly didn&#39;t happen post-mortem, either. It... seems evident to me that... Luka attacked before Axa did. Would... probably have kept attacking until the threat was gone, if he could. If Axa never finished it for him. And then he went home and... had a panic attack. And probably still gets sick thinking about it.&quot;

Her gaze dropped again, sliding listlessly over the floor. &quot;... I just... don&#39;t understand how I&#39;m so far removed from all of your reasons for loathing your brother. It&#39;s... It&#39;s your prerogative to hate Luka, but... That you consider me a friend is a deep honor, I just... I... feel like one day, you&#39;re going to look at me and see in me... what you hate in Luka. I don&#39;t... understand how you <em>can&#39;t</em>. If... If I was dating someone and... they had to frequently murder strangers to survive... I could... try to tolerate it as long as it was kept away from me, but... sooner or later, I&#39;d fear it&#39;d eventually be in front of me somehow. And I... I think I would make the same call Luka did... that they deserve someone who can embrace them wholly, and that... I&#39;d rather free them to find that person than... keep them with me, with a pressure for them to be someone they are not. How is it... not just a matter of time before I do something you see as just as... selfish, or... morally superior as what you see in Luka? I... I hear you talk about him sometimes, and... I feel like I&#39;ve... deceived you somehow, into... thinking I&#39;m not just as insufferable for you to be around. And... it makes me afraid of the day when you realize that.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Jaska&#39;s eyes narrowed. &quot;You have your similarities, I&#39;ll give you that, but I have lived in Luka&#39;s head for years. Seen him and how he behaves in his most unguarded moments. For however much it would traumatize you and you would regret your behavior, you know when you have no other choice but to kill. Luka has never killed anyone.&quot;

He quieted a moment, lowering his gaze, and muttered, &quot;You would not have starved your lover, made him suffer for weeks to satisfy your own morals, and then break up with him when things didn&#39;t go your way. You would not have put yourself in an institution to have the other person in your mind eradicated so you could have a normal life. I died, Skena. More than once.

Perhaps it&#39;ll be easier to dissect if we look at the big picture,&quot; she mused.

&quot;When Jaska came about, it wasn&#39;t until after your stay in the hospital when you seemed to truly acknowledge he was more than a facet of your own psyche. But before that, before you accepted Jaska as his own entity... your understanding was that he was a fragment of your own mind. You perceived that as a problem that warranted a solution. And you became so tunnel-visioned on seeking a solution, you deliberately excluded me from those pursuits so you couldn&#39;t be dissuaded. Then with Achoris,&quot; she continued steadily.

&quot;With Achoris, you perceived a problem, and once again became so fixated on your seeking of a solution that you refused to be dissuaded. To me... that speaks of a deeper issue. As if your self worth is tied up in fixing problems; the promise of a fix to a problem outweighs the reality of the matter. Something about that must mean something deeper to you than the matter of Jaska not being a trauma reflex, or Achoris being a cannibal. If those <em>actual</em> details were truly the issue you wanted to solve... you would heed those who tried to tell you otherwise. What do you think, Luka darling?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It is <em>because</em> of you that I am who I am today. No other reason, Luka. To say of yourself that you are not talented is provably false, as well. If you had nothing to offer this world, you would have a piss-poor business downstairs, and people who stumbled across you, like Achoris, would find nothing worthwhile in you that would have them staying and devoting their time, attention, resources, and affection to you. A <em>devil</em>, spit out of the bowels of hell, would not be comfortable in your arms. For all the animosity her father can have towards you, and for all she looks to him and him alone for guidance and direction, she still is comfortable around you, even in ways Jaska is not. That is no small feat in and of itself, darling. You have an incredible knack for making people fall in love with you, because you are, and have always been, an absolute beautiful angel of a person.&quot;

She leaned her forehead against his, her tail curling up around his ankles. &quot;You do not owe this existence your servitude. You are your own person, your own protagonist. And you do not allow yourself to see how successful and wonderful and loved you are. Some part of you... very likely did not understand entirely why Achoris loves you. And so at the first opportunity to prove your worth to him, to do something you could feel confident gave you tangible value in his eyes, the need to pursue that to its very end consumed you. This was never an issue of your morals, my love. Or what does or does not make you squeamish. This was because you did not fundamentally understand why he loved you, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Sometimes I wonder if I&#39;m lying to myself as well as everyone else... This person I&#39;m projecting that everyone falls in love with.

That is not a deficit on your part. And it comes with a very straightforward solution--and one I would deeply look forward to. And finding something new to conquer together may help you build confidence, seeing what you can accomplish. What skills you can hone all on your own. Jaska&#39;s committing crimes and adopting fiends and trying to figure out what to do with Skena when she shows up and is kind to him--he&#39;s a squeaky wheel. But just because you&#39;re not in some kind of lethal game of cat and mouse with half the entities in your life does not mean you are less interesting to me, nor less special to me.

Should be doing in general. Just because you&#39;re my brother. My twin. Who I miss doing things with.&quot; She gave his forehead another kiss.

&quot;And for the record, I do trust you. I always have. Anything that I know about Jaska that I do not tell you is solely and strictly due to his request that I not tell you. And since he&#39;s been denied agency and consent for so long, I cannot fathom disregarding those requests.&quot; A beat. 

&quot;But this last matter, I believe the only thing you do not yet know of, which Skena had slipped mention of--I can at least tell you the reason Jaska does not want you to know, and perhaps that will help for you to understand. Ironically... it is because he thinks if you are aware of a problem of his, you will try to fix it. And he does not want your help. I would hazard to presume he does not trust your help, given how your previous fixation on a solution ended up for him.&quot; Her words were gentle, her tone softening words that, with a different delivery, had the potential to land much more harshly on his ears.

&quot;It is not a matter of your morals or your willpower. Yet I believe, in that matter, is a little seed of possibility. A potential for healing. He, perhaps more than anyone else, cannot be won over with you fixing his problems. That means your efforts to explore your own innate self-worth and connect with him in ways that are not so focused on making yourself useful to him will serve to both help you blossom from the inside out, and... may actually begin to soothe the wounds between you two. When he spoke to me tonight... he sounded so hurt. Hurt at the idea that you hadn&#39;t learned anything at all--his words were that he had fallen for your vows to do better. But Luka, if he had written you off entirely and severed you from his heart altogether, there would be nothing you could hurt. He would never have put any stock in vows to do better in the first place. A part of him... wants to care. At least wants to be healed of what is past. There is a seed. And for it to be nurtured to sprout, I think... will require you to get to know yourself better. To learn how who you are can be perfectly sufficient. To see and experience how people will still love you and desire to be around you even if you are not making some sort of effort to somehow earn your keep.&quot;

She offered a small, but hopeful smile. &quot;I&#39;m willing to help. Without question. Perhaps the first step is all of us speaking together; in exchange for a commitment to transparency, you can offer a commitment to not involve yourself in the discussed matters unless invited to do so. I think you may find that you can have meaningful conversations with your brother, getting to know one another, without trying to make yourself useful to him. And perhaps, the more you see how people are still drawn to you even when you are not actively trying to become valuable to them, the more you may be forced to realize that there is something innately valuable about you that people love. That you are enough, without ever having to lift a finger.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
