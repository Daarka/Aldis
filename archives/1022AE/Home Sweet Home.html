Most of his time had been spent at the location he and Skena had picked out, building their new home. He took occasional breaks to hunt the odd monster for his guild or to accompany Skena to see her Uncle and rescue a one-armed, partially eaten woman, and spent a lot of time training Atreyu as he grew, but Fielbarry hadn&#39;t seen much of him other than to purchase supplies and have them carted out to the location. A lot of it he took care of himself, cutting down trees and whatnot, making a saw horse so he could cut logs into planks. But nails, tools, cast iron pots and stoves, all the other things he needed came from Fielbarry.

From the nearby river he&#39;d hauled the rocks used around the foundation and for the chimneys. He&#39;d developed some muscle definition during his hard work. Whenever he had Skena over, he&#39;d check with her to make any changes or additions she wanted, and anything she wanted to build out of bone, she was welcome to.

Now, finally, the house was about finished. The roof had been put in place, the shingles nailed in, and Kaleva was painting sealant over the house to protect the wood from weather and rot. All that was left was to finish furnishing beyond the bare bones it had in there (no pun intended). There was even an attached stable for Atreyu that gave him his own place but also allowed him access to the Atreyu-proofed areas of the house, master bedroom included.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, March 7, 2022 9:20 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It had to be if she was carrying it.

She had been helping out quite a bit. Not so much with the grunt work, though she offered whatever assistance she could on that front, menial though it was. But when the walls were erected and a floor and roof at least crudely in place, the little worker bee in her had sprung to action bringing the place to life. Setting up furniture, organizing belongings that were okay to put in place a bit prematurely, going through everything Kaleva built with a fine-toothed comb to add those little details like knobs on cabinet doors and such--and a good amount of her efforts had even gone to the surrounding land, laying a foundation of her own in the form of the beginnings of what was promising to be a surplus of lush garden flora. Kaleva made a cabin, and Skena turned it into a homey cottage. 

Nothing without his approval, though, of course. It was a shared project. 

She huffed a little breath, resting her bundle on the ground (it seemed lightweight enough, but she still sounded slightly winded from carrying it from the town) and straightening up to assess the new building. &quot;How much more do you have to do?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was laying in the grass nearby. He was standing on a ladder with the bucket of sealant hanging from it, and he put the brush into the bucket and reached up to swipe his forearm over his forehead, climbing down from the ladder. &quot;This is it. Just sealing everything up. The next rainfall will test for any leaks in the roof. I do want to build a shed and a smoke house, maybe a sauna too, but none of those are urgent.&quot;

Stretching stiffly, he made his way over to her, blinking at the puffy bag she&#39;d brought with. &quot;What&#39;s all that?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She looked down at the bag, smiling. &quot;Our clothes! It&#39;s one of the last things I haven&#39;t dragged over from the guild hall. Most of our food is still back there, but I saved the more perishable stuff for last.

It still had the smell of the sealant about it, but the sealant on the interior was dry, and the windows all open to help air it out.

&quot;What do we have to do for that portal to the guild hall? It sounds like it&#39;d be an expensive enchantment.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;It&#39;s more of a time commitment than anything else. I already have the materials. I&#39;ll just need to cast the magic anew once a day for a full year--and then it will be a permanent gate. But in the meantime, it&#39;ll still function as if it were a permanent fixture for the next year, once I start doing the spell. It&#39;s just that if I miss a day, I&#39;ll have to start over.&quot;

Gods bless the aether technology that allowed for running water, even in a remote cabin like this. Filling up a jug, she set it on the dinning table along with the lemons and sugar, and sat down to get to work squeezing lemons and mixing everything together. 

&quot;But I have all the materials to cover the full year&#39;s worth of spellcasting. So unless I miss a day for some reason, we should be all set.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Anyways. The portal—I set everything up with Ingrid while I was in town, so I have an anchor back in her shop to connect the magic to. I can get started on that once I get this made here. And honestly,” she went on, gripping a lemon half over the jug of water and beginning to carefully wring the juice out, “you know some magic. I bet I could show you what to do, in case I’m ever away for more than twenty-four hours at a time. There’s a scroll to cast off of, so you don’t need any particular education to be able to do it other than knowing the process. Like <em>I</em> can’t even use this magic on my own, but I can when using the scroll, so you should be no different.

That’s why nonvenomous snakes should be allowed to stay in gardens and otherwise around people; they usually kill and eat the snakes that would be dangerous to people. Yuan-ti do everything they can to be as much like snakes as possible, in varying degrees of success. I have no doubt those biological changes that make otherwise humanoid individuals cold blooded—which is a very extreme change from a human, of course—are also responsible for lending them the dietary needs of a snake.

The first yuan-ti wanted to be snakes for the power of it. This philosophy that the perfection of a snake is, in part, due to being unburdened by emotion.&quot; She shrugged.

&quot;It&#39;s not for me, either. But I think I can understand how it started. And in cases of individuals like Mahva, his psyche is fundamentally shaped by his genetics to the point where his natural inclinations and muted emotional capacity are just how he was born. He didn&#39;t choose to be a yuan-ti any more than you chose to be a tiefling. And if emotions don&#39;t come naturally to you, I think forcing a mask of displaying emotions that aren&#39;t entirely there beneath the surface would just be performative and exhausting. If that was your existence, the idea of being an emotional, social creature might feel just as alien and uncomfortable as someone like you thinking about being a reptile. That said... I don&#39;t think Mahva is void of emotion. I think he just doesn&#39;t express those emotions in the ways people like you and I have grown up considering to be normal. Honestly,&quot; she continued, tipping her head thoughtfully, &quot;he likely has a lot in common with Axa in that regard.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The stuff I set up with her earlier takes care of everything at that location.&quot; Setting her glass aside, she moved out of the kitchen and into a small, inconspicuous and almost completely empty room she had made sure Kaleva included in the floor plan of the cabin. It was little more than a closet--but it was <em>supposed</em> to be inconspicuous. After all, this portal would open up directly into their friends&#39; private home; best to make it at least a <em>little</em> difficult for a potential intruder to access. 

Inside this little space, she had already stored the supplies on the otherwise empty floor. The &quot;closet&quot; did not currently have a door of its own, but not out of forgetfulness. Kneeling on the ground, she pulled a golden bowl in front of herself, pushing it to sit against the far wall, centered along its width. Picking up the spell scroll, she pried open the wax seal that held it closed, delicately unfurling it. 

&quot;So I keep forgetting to say this out loud--but I think we should put a hinged bookcase here in this threshold. A secret door. Make it look just like a normal shelf from the outside, just for a little extra security and discretion. But have it operate like a typical door if you know how to manipulate it.

Part of the magic is that the quantity of blood will persist, no matter how much its used, until its been used three hundred and sixty-five times. It&#39;s a magic bowl and all that.&quot;

She waited as his blood pattered into the golden bowl, allowing it to fill up just enough to have a useful quantity available, without it being an amount of blood it would notably affect him to lose. When she was happy with the quantity, she reached forward with a little glimmer of golden light to seal his newest wound, reaching to take the dagger from him as it became her turn. 

Rolling up her sleeve, she squinted at the paper-thin, gaunt flesh of her arm, clearly not quite so effortless about carving herself up. &quot;... How do you <em>do</em> this so much,&quot; she muttered, gritting her teeth and pulling the blade across her skin in a motion that was not quite so practiced and smooth as Kaleva had been. 

&quot;Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.&quot; Despite her quiet complaints, she was at least physically unflinching, moving her arm to allow the blood to drip down over the puddle of Kaleva&#39;s in the bowl. Her own blood was a duller, darker, drier color--apart from the obvious difference of the odor--which was especially noticeable as it dripped into Kaleva&#39;s normal crimson supply, looking like it sullied that rich color. Dead blood mingling with fresh blood.

When she figured she had contributed about the same quantity as Kaleva, she pulled away and healed herself, too. Smoothing her sleeve down again, she picked up the spell scroll, a golden nail, and a small hammer she had stored in this space along with the bowl, standing up and carefully beginning the process of nailing the scroll to the far wall.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Tuesday, March 8, 2022 11:32 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lifting his healed forearm to his mouth, he licked away the lingering smear of blood on his skin and tried not to be obvious about the way he sniffed toward the bowl, his tail&#39;s motions not unlike the gentle wagging of a dog&#39;s tail.

It has to be spoken in full, while you use this,&quot; she continued, stooping to pick up the last item she had squirreled away here: a golden paintbrush with perfectly white bristles, &quot;to paint the outline of the doorway on the wall. In our blood. I&#39;ll have to set up a stool in here for doing it myself--but this first time, we should be doing it together, anyways. Just to help really lay the foundation of it being attuned to the both of us.&quot; Holding the bowl in one hand and the brush in the other, she dipped those snow white bristles into the blood, immediately staining them. She gave it a little swirl to ensure both contributors&#39; blood was evenly combined, looking up at Kaleva. 

&quot;Ready? We can take our time and go slow. We&#39;ll just need to read the incantation together. And you&#39;ll probably have to paint the top of the door frame for me.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Alright... off we go then.&quot;

After a pause to confirm the dimensions of the desired doorway with Kaleva, she took the wetted brush and placed it against the wall where the wall met the floor. Speaking at an even and steady pace to ensure there was no challenge in them speaking simultaneously, she began to go over the incantation, most of which she had memorized already. When the outline she was painting got too high for her to reach, she relinquished the brush to Kaleva, taking it back from him when the outline came back within range for her. 

It was fairly macabre looking at first... just streaks of dripping blood across their freshly built wall. But as the incantation went on, little golden particles began to shimmer up from the streaks, condensing more and more until everything that had been crimson was instead a gently glowing, nearly metallic shade of gold. As the outline was completed, that gold gave a subtle pulse once, before seeping inwards towards the center of the shape that had been drawn, the appearance of the wall in that space becoming blurry and almost warped. 

The whole process took just under ten minutes--as the incantation was long, and blood was not a very efficient paint medium. But after a bit of blurry, warped, golden visuals that made one&#39;s eyes confused with what they were or were not seeing, the glow subsided again. In its place was a door frame on the wall--a real, tangible one--made of whimsically placed cobblestones. Where the wall had been was now a quaint, but well crafted wooden door with a golden handle, the materials (with the exception, of course, of the perfectly polished gold) seamlessly matching the materials used for foundations and doors in the rest of the cabin. The only sign that there was anything magical to this door were the small, subtle, occasional motes of golden light that floated off the handle, drifting short distances through the air before blinking out again, like cheery little embers.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Well… you’re far more familiar with her than I am. But based on my interactions with her… she doesn’t seem malicious? A trickster, sure. She doesn’t seem to take much seriously. But I’ve never seen her act with intent to harm, or in any way to suggest that she would. I don’t think I’ve ever seen her tease you more than just light, harmless comments with an undertone of fondness. If she came to visit you at your lowest, it wouldn’t track with the behavior that I’ve observed for her to decide that was a good time to mess with you. She’s a bit on the chaotic side, but she’s never struck me as tone-deaf.”

She shrugged, though he couldn’t see it. “If I had to bet money on it, I’d say there’s a good chance she wouldn’t have used a compassionate gesture in your time of need as an opportunity to lie to you about something stupid.

When she had emptied out the basket, she set it aside, glancing back to the horse-dog. &quot;You hear that?

If it was a child they were raising, it might be worth correcting a snarky attitude. But on a puppy... well, he got a pass. It was charming.

&quot;It&#39;s been alright. I&#39;ve been helping Altaira with some of the more clerical upkeep--&quot; she paused, realizing the confusion her words could cause. &quot;... Paperwork and such, not clerical as in my breed of magic. It&#39;s been the easiest way for me to help out. And... in a weird way...&quot; She paused, her movements slowing as she stared into space, chewing her lip a little. 

&quot;... It feels... familiar. To work under someone with her demeanor. Someone pragmatic and semi-formal. A part of me has this... irrational worry that she&#39;ll start to exploit me. But she&#39;s never shown any signs of moving in that direction. She&#39;s never breathed a word that would indicate she particularly cares about who or what I am, outside of the role I play within the guild. It&#39;s... It&#39;s familiar without being the stress of what I&#39;m used to.&quot;

Shaking her head a little as if to clear her thoughts, she continued putting food away. &quot;They&#39;re sending a party into the swamps in the northeast soon. In helping Altaira with paper-pushing stuff, I&#39;ve gleaned a loose idea of what it&#39;s about, and it lines up with what I learned when we went to Belhaven; people go missing, and a concentration of oddities in that area makes it suspicious and drew the guild&#39;s focus in that area.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Then her gaze wandered, out past the dividing wall that kept Atreyu at bay, into the main living space, freshly furnished and sealed and all brand new and waiting to be lived in.

She took a shuddering breath, trying not to spiral into too deep of hysterics--though the emotions to cause such a spiral certainly existed. There was a lot of pain behind the building of this home. Kaleva was right; they&#39;d earned it.

Drawn by Skena&#39;s tears, Atreyu leaned over the half wall and stretched his neck out toward her, letting out a soft, inquisitive whine.

At his words, she smiled softly.

“Welcome home.”

She took another little bite of her dessert, comfortably sitting in the quiet as she chewed. When she had swallowed her bite, she didn’t take another, tilting her head to rest it on Kaleva’s shoulder for a while.

“… I don’t know how relationships are supposed to work,” she went on after a moment, her words soft. “I don’t think I’ve ever really understood <em>romance</em>. But I also… I don’t know why things are always presented as so binary. Like there’s categories everything has to fall into, no circumstances where something might be outside of those categories. But… the reality is that I love you,” she continued, her words delicate and vulnerable, “and I think you’re my soulmate. And the world seems to assume that should come with the… the trappings of what is considered a romantic relationship. But I just… I have everything I want already. I don’t know how to define it with the only labels the world has available. But I have everything I want. And I love you.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He shrugged the shoulder she wasn&#39;t leaning against. &quot;I think... labels and distinctions between romantic partner and friends are more for the benefit of other people who would want to place us in a category. But I don&#39;t think we need that. You&#39;re right. We&#39;re soulmates.

“… It feels nice to say. I’m glad we can say it.” She sighed softly, letting out the long breath of contentment. “I want things to always be the way they are tonight. I know they won’t be… I know things are always changing. But… as long as I can come home at the end of it all and have this waiting for me… I don’t think I’ll ever truly want for anything.”

She nestled against him a bit more snugly. “You’re such a beautiful person, Kaleva. That feather is going to audibly slam against the ground when your heart is weighed against it.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Atreyu had been witness to all this snuggling for too long without being part of it. He got up and went to wedge himself in behind them, flopping down on the floor and curling up around them like a warm, furry, slightly bony couch. He swung his head around to plop his chin in Skena&#39;s lap, his tail wagging and slapping lightly against Kaleva.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
