Instead, she had carefully made her way across town to her brother’s residence. Not the one who lived just down the street, of course, but the one who lived far more isolated and tedious for a blind woman to travel to.

But she wasn’t one to complain; he had good reasons for wanting space between the town and where he housed his daughter, and she could appreciate them.

It wasn’t her first time visiting, of course, so despite her journey being a little on the slow side as she navigated the city, she made it to her destination easily enough. Coming to a halt outside the front door, she gave it a few gentle knocks, shifting to lean idly on her staff as she waited.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He and Axa had apparently been in the middle of eating dinner. Jaska had had to learn several skills upon adopting Axa, one of which was cooking decent food. But he managed well enough, and the smell of steak and seasoned sweet potatoes lingered in the house.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was still admittedly odd to him that people would actually seek out his company without ulterior motives. So he responded to the second, as the door was closed and locked behind her. &quot;Unless Axa suddenly started cooking for herself. I suppose you&#39;ll be wanting some.&quot;

He led her into the kitchen, though his footsteps were nearly silent in just his socks. He went into the fridge to pull out another steak wrapped in butcher&#39;s paper without really waiting for a reply, moving the cast iron pan back onto the stove to heat it up again. &quot;Empty seats are directly in front of you and to the right of the table. Axa is sitting on the left.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I dropped in unannounced, it would be rude of me to expect to have food made for me. But based on the smell alone, I&#39;d say you&#39;re doing remarkably well with cooking.&quot;

Following his instructions, she found her way to a seat; she wasn&#39;t the most familiar with his home, but it was hardly debilitating for her to just take a little longer to navigate than she would in her own spaces. As she seated herself (once Rhatihl was carefully propped against the wall out of the way), she cast a smile in Axa&#39;s direction. &quot;Hello, sweetheart.&quot;

Axa was half-crouched on her seat, as if she had been perched there on her feet before relaxing her weight down fully--though with her legs still folded up like a gargoyle. Naturally, the girl gave no response, blinking owlishly at Valentine, though she was comfortable enough with the woman to remain relaxed as she joined the table. 

&quot;Truthfully,&quot; Val continued, turning her attention back after the sound of Jaska&#39;s voice, &quot;There were some things I wanted to chat about. But I don&#39;t get to visit <em>your</em> home very much, and I thought it&#39;d be more pleasant to talk in person.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Anyway, if you&#39;re going to stumble your way out here, I might as well give you something in exchange for the effort.&quot;

He took a sweet potato from the pantry, using a knife to skillfully peel it - he <em>was</em> very good with knives - and diced it into smaller pieces while the steak cooked. As usual with him, he didn&#39;t express affection in words. Words were for deflection. His actions were where the affection was hidden. &quot;So, what&#39;s on your mind?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;But I digress. I&#39;ve had something lurking in my mind for a while, and it&#39;s never been necessary or relevant to ask you up to this point.&quot; Leaning back in her chair, she folded her arm over the back of it, tilting her head towards her brother&#39;s direction. 

&quot;Do you, by any chance, have any memories from before Luka? I suppose we&#39;ve all just assumed that your existence began from within him, but... I&#39;m curious if you remember an existence prior to that. Or if that <em>was</em> where the timeline of Jaska began.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He considered the question as he went to flip over the steak in the pan, and added another dollop of butter off to the side of it, where he started cooking the potatoes.

&quot;My first memories are a sensation of wrongness, of being trapped. I could see, but I could not control my body. What I could see of my body felt wrong. I felt like I was somewhere I wasn&#39;t supposed to be, and I raged against it. Fruitlessly.&quot; He rinsed his hands off in the sink, tongue pressing against the inside of his cheek. &quot;I had strange dreams when Luka slept, and I was dragged into unconsciousness with him.

Always listening, with no telling how much of what was being said was understood and processed fully in her tiny head. But she looked up as Jaska addressed her, and after a pause, nodded a little, quietly putting her fork down and slithering off her seat to go hunt down some paper.

Val listened to the--even to her senses--<em>extremely</em> faint sounds of Axa moving, her expression still thoughtful. &quot;To be frank, I&#39;m not even sure it&#39;s of any concern?&quot; She wondered aloud. &quot;It... struck me more as a state of being, and less as something... <em>happening</em>. It&#39;s beyond curious, of course... but I&#39;m not yet convinced its cause for worry.&quot; She sighed wistfully.

&quot;The annoying thing is that there are a great many things I <em>do</em> know a good deal about--but for almost all of them, the sometimes vital piece I&#39;m missing is visual appearances. There are many entities and creatures I know of, conceptually, in great depth, but if you showed me a picture of one--and I borrowed eyes to see it with--I would have no idea it was that known creature. So when the only evidence provided as to what something is is how it <em>looks</em>, I&#39;m afraid I become infuriatingly useless.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Things Luka had no part in--nor would I have wanted him to have a part in. And being a powerful aberration himself, who had resided in the Astral Sea until I dragged him out of it, he has an understanding of many different kinds of entities that our little textbooks didn&#39;t cover.&quot;

She shrugged. &quot;And once I truly got to know you, I found it harder and harder to believe you were some facet of Luka&#39;s psyche. Even before I knew splitting you two was a viable possibility. I&#39;ve always known Luka like the back of my hand, and there was no... repressed vitriol anywhere in him that just needed an excuse to surface. No, you... you always were an individual to me. So for a very long time now, I&#39;ve been of the belief that Rhaithl created you, somehow. Especially if you have no memories of existing prior to Luka. Which would mean that what your daughter sees is either... some sort of residual shape taken by Rhatihl&#39;s aberrant influence, or... I&#39;m wrong.

After a moment, Axa padded back into the room with a relatively large sheet of drawing paper Luka had gotten for her, with a charcoal pencil grasped in her hand. She simply stood off to the side once she returned, not sure what was expected of her.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Axa squinted slightly under his kiss, but that faint air of uncertainty eased out of her as he provided clearer instructions. Carefully, she crawled back up onto her chair, telekinetically pushing her plate and silverware away to clear space for the paper. She planted a little hand on either side of the page to anchor it in place, and then the floating pencil went to work scribbling away. 

&quot;Mm--Will you include Luka, too, dear? I think it&#39;d be intriguing to see the comparisons,&quot; Val piped up between bites. As Jaska passed behind her chair, her tail slipped out to brush his leg, just enough contact to form an eye-stealing connection as long as he did not reject the magic.

Axa paused in her scribbling as Luka was also requested, not looking up from the page. The pencil repositioned slightly, and then continued scribbling.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He kept his gaze mostly on the paper, but as usual, those scribbles tended to not make a lick of sense until the exact moment they suddenly did, so he was patient in not understanding what he was seeing at first.

His twin tails rested on the floor near his feet, and the tip of one rested over the top of Val&#39;s foot.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The kind of affection that you scared away if you gave it too much attention. So she didn&#39;t acknowledge the tail on her foot; she simply, privately, appreciated it.

Axa drew for quite a while, the pencil consistently moving about the entire time. When she finally let it fall to the side and sat back again, the page was thoroughly filled with markings--and the shapes she had been building up, and all their little details, did suddenly create one cohesive illustration.

Valentine was in the middle, with Luka to the left of her, and Jaska to the right. At least--presumably Jaska. What Jaska saw when he looked in the mirror, that image was sort of present. But in a manner that vaguely resembled how she had portrayed lycanthropy, there was another shape overlaying the image of Jaska, perfectly mirroring his pose and expression. This figure was distinctly inhuman, though its anatomy seemed to take loose suggestions from that of a mortal man. Two arms, two legs, an upright torso--but that was about where the humanity ended. What should have been a mouth was instead a jagged maw of fanged teeth over an angular chin, and either the face had no eyes, or the glowing feature in the center of the face--about where a nose should have been--was some manner of ocular organ. Sweeping up from that center point and growing at an outward angle were two enormous horns that arced at least a foot or two away from the head, with smaller pointed features beneath them that were either elfin ears, or a secondary set of horns; Axa&#39;s art was uncannily detailed, but the scribbly nature of it made such distinctions a little difficult. The creature was shrouded in wispy robes that almost seemed to be depicted with an eerie glow from within them, with such involvement of light only indicated by an unusual <em>lack</em> of scribbles in certain areas. Yet viewing the drawing from a bit of a distance, the scribbles blurred together to the naked eye, and those more barren areas did recreate the illusion of glowing light incredibly well. Beneath the tendrils of whatever shrouded the figure, it also seemed Axa had indicated narrow, digitigrade legs, with feet that were neither paws (like her own) nor hooves, but something... else.

Valentine, as she had mentioned, was a bit more tame in comparison. But only in comparison; while she had no overlaying entity, her visage seemed... off, somehow. Axa had colored her eyes in completely black, despite their buttercream coloration being distinctly pale. There was a small, but dense aura around her of something dark and viscous, like a runny slime that was emitted from her figure and cloyed the immediate space around her. The staff she held was easily the most chaotic thing on the page. Though the physical shape was true to life, <em>intense</em> shapes seemed to ambiguously bulge out from it, like something far too large was restrained into that smaller shape and was <em>straining</em> violently to burst free. It was like the air around the staff crackled with dark energy, and though a semi-clean silhouette of the tangible shape was discernable, it somehow looked jittery and shaking, even as a static image.

Luka... Sweet Luka had no such anomalies about him. The only thing Axa apparently saw on him that Jaska and Valentine did not were the little black wisps of inky tendrils that connected him to Valentine, just as those same tendrils bound Val to the staff. She was well and truly his patron, having completely absolved Rhatihl of any direct contact with her brother; all of his magic went exclusively through her. It looked ominous on paper, but were Luka present to see this depiction, it would likely be a quiet relief.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Valentine&#39;s visage and Rhatihl&#39;s influence around her really wasn&#39;t terribly surprising and was barely given more than a glance, same with Luka and those tendrils of black energy connecting him to Valentine. But his own visage was just...

<em>Familiar.</em>

He flicked his attention all around that phantasmal image surrounding himself, and after some confusion around the center of it, finally recognized it as an eye. Like his own crimson eye with its cat-like slitted pupil. And the shape of the horns... Like his own, but greater in size.

He went back to staring at the drawing, soaking in the details once again. It... really did feel familiar. But in such a vague way as to be barely more than a phantom.

&quot;Before dragging her into this, would you mind trying to coerce any sort of answers out of Rhatihl? Just because I am inclined to trust her doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m inclined to spill everything to her.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The staff, as if magnetically, pulled itself from the wall and drew towards her to fit into her waiting hand, and she tipped her head towards it with a pleasant smile.

&quot;What do you say, <em>old friend</em>? Feel like being helpful?&quot; Her fingers tightened around the staff, and over the course of a few seconds, the buttercream color of her eyes bled away, to be replaced with that empty, inky blackness that Axa had drawn.

For Jaska, it was rather uneventful to watch. Her pleasant smile remained as her eyes stayed drowned in black, her grip on the staff firm and unyielding--and Rhatihl&#39;s singular eye boring down at her face, the slitted pupil almost quivering faintly. After a moment, Axa removed herself from the space around Valentine, relocating to the top of a nearby cabinet where she could observe with a bit more distance between them--though Jaska could only guess at what <em>she</em> was witnessing.

A minute or two passed, feeling a lot longer than it actually was. Eventually, Val drew in a deep breath and released a long sigh, blinking a few times until her eyes had returned to normal. 

&quot;He&#39;s obscuring that information somewhere,&quot; she said dismissively, sounding only casually disappointed. &quot;I have an easier time prying something out of him when I know what I&#39;m looking for. But since I don&#39;t, and since he&#39;s witnessed all of this and clearly knows what I&#39;m after, it appears he&#39;s muddied the waters in preparation for my prying. It&#39;s like wading through an encyclopedia containing every aberration in existence, and you&#39;re trying to find something without knowing what you&#39;re looking for. In other words, a hissyfit where irrelevant information is thrown at me in hopes of deterring me with a dizzying excess of fluff. Mm.&quot;

Her voice continued exclusively in Jaska&#39;s mind. <em>&#39;I&#39;ll give him time to lower his guard, perhaps isolate him more to stoke some of the madness that&#39;s already taken root, and then try again when he&#39;s less prepared for my searching.&#39;</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He looked up at Axa then, lifting a brow. &quot;It&#39;s alright, child. Neither of them will harm you.&quot; He didn&#39;t try to coax her to come down, though. Just sent out a simple reassurance in his usual calm, measured tones.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He didn&#39;t want to drop that bomb quite yet.

She carefully shut the door behind her as she entered, looking around only to an extent that was polite. &quot;Yes, I--I meant to reach out to you when I woke up, but... the day just... got away from me, I suppose. And then I... I wanted to thank you again. For everything. And I felt like that was... best done in person. Hello, Axa,&quot; she interjected, noticing the girl still lounging on the top of the cabinet. 

&quot;I, um. Well, to be honest, I... I couldn&#39;t really bear to animate the corpse long enough to speak with it,&quot; she continued slowly. &quot;But... I was able to commune with my god instead. Which is probably a more sound source, anyways. I was reassured that Ahmes had been in town by himself.&quot; She delicately sat her basket down on the edge of the dinning table as she spoke.

&quot;I&#39;ll be burying him soon. After which point, any divination magic sent to look for him will at least not relay anything to do with myself surrounding him. And... Kaleva and Achoris and I spoke at length about what to do regarding myself specifically. In the end, Achoris&#39; patron actually offered to help craft a ward I could wear that would shield me from divination completely. So... by the time Ahmes is realized to be missing, or deceased, I will have removed myself from the equation. And going forward, any attempts to scry on me or the like will wholly fail, so... the only way anyone from Cautica will find me is by doing so in person. Which... greatly lessens the likelihood of it happening, I think.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was just in a simple plum colored button-up shirt, sleeves rolled up around his elbows, untucked from his trousers and just in stocking feet. He&#39;d showered, but hadn&#39;t put any product in his hair to keep it smoothed back, and so the parts where his indigo hair turned purple were curling more notably at his nape and on the trimmed hair of his tails.

&quot;That is good to know. I&#39;ll keep an eye out for anyone searching for him and make sure to direct them away from Fielbarry if they come sniffing around.&quot;

&quot;...

She didn&#39;t explain how hard it was to scurry this far away from her home or how she had a hood up the entire journey, because she didn&#39;t want to invite an implication of guilt towards him. 

&quot;I, um. Part of what had the time get away from me today is that I--I tried to keep myself occupied as a distraction.

&quot;... Goodness, the aura from Axa is so strong,&quot; she murmured, half to herself. &quot;I&#39;m pleased to inform you she&#39;s still the most fiendish fiend I&#39;ve ever encountered. But regarding you...&quot;

She squinted, tipping her head slightly. The look on her face made it clear she wasn&#39;t entirely sure what she was looking at, but it hadn&#39;t been what she was expecting.

&quot;... So it&#39;s... it&#39;s a little hard to explain how things look through this spell if you&#39;ve never cast it yourself,&quot; she started slowly. &quot;But the results aren&#39;t binary. It might as well be with Axa, for example, because she is exactly the type of creature it&#39;s meant to detect. But... if I cast this spell around Kaleva, on the other hand, I do still detect fiendish energy from him, despite him being a humanoid from the material plane. That signature on him--just as the celestial signature on myself or my uncle--is more... residual. It indicates an influence, rather than a state of being. Likewise, there&#39;s that residual fiendish signature on you that is recognizable to me as a mark of your race being a tiefling, which I would have expected to be there. But there&#39;s...&quot;

She drifted off, still squinting, still trying to figure out how to describe her observations. &quot;... If the infernal influence in your blood that makes you a tiefling creates a residual signature of fiend upon you, then there is something even fainter than that kind of signature... more like... I... I can&#39;t say, really. Like a heritage many generations removed. And that mark is one of an aberration. Which I would have very much not have predicted being present.&quot; She blinked a few times as if to refocus her eyes, though she upheld the spell for the moment.

&quot;... Perhaps it has to do with Valentine? I&#39;ve seen her magic before--enough to presume she has aberrant ties herself.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Of course, I had no way of accurately guessing your story otherwise. Though when you came to me about Axa&#39;s lost tooth, I assumed yours was an unusual story. Most people learn about children naturally losing their teeth through their own experience of being a child and losing their teeth, so if an adult was ignorant to that process, the logical conclusion is that they either were never a child, or don&#39;t remember being a child. So despite how unusual your story is--as I understand it, at least--I can&#39;t say I was terribly surprised to learn it.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At his question, she paused to try to remember exactly what Luka had said. &quot;... Something about... Luka and Valentine dabbling too much in eldritch magic.

Reaching over for the sketchbook, Jaska flipped it open to Axa&#39;s most recent drawing, and pushed it over to Skena so she could see.

&quot;Valentine can use her magic to see through the eyes of other willing people, and one night, borrowed Axa&#39;s eyes. This, apparently, is how I look to her through true sight.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She ghosted a finger over the edge of the page, though not over it where it would smudge the charcoal.

&quot;... That&#39;s... Huh.&quot; She couldn&#39;t help but also look at the depiction of Valentine and her staff. Luka had also told them the woman had imprisoned and enslaved this patron of theirs, and... this image did seem to support that idea. <em>A force of nature</em>, Luka had called her. Skena found it deeply unsettling to wrap her mind around.

But the depiction of Jaska was wholly unexpected, on the other hand. 

... And then there was good little Luka, with no hellish aura to be found. Good for him.

&quot;This would support the nature of the readings coming off of you,&quot; she said slowly after a moment of pouring over the illustration. &quot;And it would certainly imply that no, this has nothing to do with Valentine. At least not directly. The aberrant essence on you appears to be its own entity entirely. At least, Axa hasn&#39;t depicted it tied to your sister at all... unlike what I think I&#39;m seeing correctly as ties Luka has to Valentine through, presumably, the magic he maintains.&quot;

After a moment, she tore her gaze away to look back up at him, her eyes shifting about those subtle, magical overlays that indicated the residual influences upon him, reassessing them now that she knew what they were meant to suggest. &quot;... But if you were... some... some creature forced into the vessel of a humanoid... I would expect the aberrant essence to be much stronger. More indicative of your authentic state of being. And what Axa drew... doesn&#39;t really suggest that this figure is the patron itself. It looks to be mirroring you exactly, overlaid on you precisely. We&#39;ve seen her draw Achoris, who had a deity enshrouding him and a patron contained on his person--and neither of those were depicted like this in relation to the person themselves. And--if this figure <em>were</em> supposed to represent the patron, I would expect it to have some sort of visible connection to Valentine or her staff. But it&#39;s wholly independent of those things. So the essence on you... I would hesitate to label it like a fingerprint of the patron&#39;s involvement. If we&#39;re considering both the signature on your person as well as this depiction, I&#39;d have to assume the aberrant signature <em>is</em>, somehow, <em>you</em>. But...&quot; she made a bit of a face.

&quot;It&#39;s... almost too faint for that. Kaleva is a tiefling, likely many generations removed from the individual who first invited the infernal into his bloodline. And the fiendish energy on you is as strong as his--and it completely <em>dwarfs</em> the aberrant energy. It&#39;s fainter than any heritage I&#39;ve encountered. To the point where I would hesitate to even assume this is <em>dozens</em> of generations removed--and even if it <em>was</em> a part of your bloodline, I have never heard of an aberration mingling with humanoid genetics. Not the way fiends can to produce tieflings.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I&#39;m steeped in the study of necromancy. That&#39;s no secret. And all necromancy is, is the manipulation of lifeforce. Both giving and taking away.

He added after a moment, &quot;The ritual which granted me my own body didn&#39;t take into account certain unknown factors at the time, and that&#39;s why my life force doesn&#39;t replenish itself.&quot; Because she knew the rest anyway, so why not fill in that blank.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

So then all the times she hadn&#39;t needed to give him a transfusion was because someone had been killed. Was it her favorite thing to learn? Absolutely not.

But... he considered her an ally. And for being the daughter of a god and a devout cleric to said god, Skena had never been the sort to impose her morals onto others. Even though murder was... pretty objectively bad...

But he was an adult. He had been through enough to more than earn him the liberty to make his own choices. So she decided to do her best to forget having learned this detail, moving past it to her initial focus.

&quot;... That... makes sense, I think,&quot; she finally replied, her words slow and thoughtful. &quot;Creating a living body out of nothing is no small feat. It would have likely required some... almost surgical alignment of the soul to the vessel for the lifeforce to take root properly. As much as I just finished saying I was intimately familiar with manipulating lifeforce, I&#39;m not even sure <em>I</em> could accomplish it. Whatever Valentine did, the fact that you&#39;re able to pass to just about anyone as a normal tiefling is immensely commendable; I imagine so much could have gone wrong with such a ritual.&quot;

A beat. &quot;But I digress. Apologies, such things fascinate me. I ask because... I thought I&#39;d heard of a type of humanoid-imitating aberration who had similar interactions with lifeforce. Siphoning it and such. Something about a dying star, drawing life into it in the absence of its own.&quot; She shook her head. &quot;It had caught my interest, briefly, due to the parallels with necromantic magics, like the transfusions I&#39;ve done for you. But it was only a passing curiosity, and one I quickly moved on from when that curiosity was sated and there was nothing really in my wheelhouse that the topic contained. But I...&quot; She squinted, &quot;I can&#39;t for the life of me remember what they were called.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That sounds right. Sort of--Hadar is...&quot; her words faded as she stared down at the table, trying to scrape together an education from long ago that had not been relevant enough to retain fully.

&quot;... So there is our world. We call it the material plane. Aldis.&quot; Her hands cupped a small circle on the surface of the table. &quot;We are a planet floating in space. That space that surrounds us is dizzyingly vast and uninhabitable to creatures like us.&quot; The circle of her hands expanded considerably. &quot;That is the cosmos of the material plane. I&#39;ve heard it referred to as <em>realmspace</em>. It is more vast that we are capable of comprehending, and yet, it has boundaries. Beyond some of those boundaries is what&#39;s called the Far Realm. This is where aberrations originate from. It is like our cosmos, but warped by chaos and the Null, with its contents often being volatile, destructive, and highly infectious. Many warlocks, even all the way here on the material plane, draw from entities in the Far Realm--warlocks such as your siblings. Your prior patron would have been one of these entities. But the Far Realm is not a world like the one we live in; it is not made of land to walk upon, but is closer in nature to the cosmos above us. Dimensions are more of a suggestion. The laws of physics as we know them would likely apply very, very little there. And so when I refer to entities that inhabit this space, they do not take the form of creatures like those that fill our world.&quot;

She glanced back up at him as she spoke. &quot;In fact, some of the largest and most powerful entities of the Far Realm take forms we would consider to be stars. But they&#39;re not quite stars. The stars in our cosmos are not usually living, sentient entities. But &#39;stars&#39; that have been saturated in the aberration of the Far Realms are; sometimes they even move in the sky, abandoning any sort of fixed position. Hadar is the name of one such star. Hadar is a dying star, if I&#39;m not mistaken. Stars take an immensely long amount of time to die, sometimes millions of years. But Hadar is a dying star with sentience, and it does not <em>want</em> to die--so it siphons lifeforce back to itself wherever it can. And large, powerful entities from the Far Realms often create creatures in their likeness to spread about existence as minions or servants to them. While you are almost certainly not Hadar itself, I would not be surprised if you were--or had been--a creature from Hadar&#39;s influence, given your ability to siphon lifeforce and this... ambiguously aberrant background.&quot;

She held up her hands a little. &quot;I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s the extent of what I know, though. Your sister may have better insight beyond that.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Perhaps your crime was merely existing in the wrong place at the wrong time. After all, this patron seemed to find it acceptable to &#39;punish&#39; Luka, despite--I&#39;m quite confident--Luka having never done anything to offend, disrespect, or threaten it.

&quot;... You say that very proudly, but it&#39;s not true, Jaska,&quot; she murmured gently. &quot;Your moral compass might look different from mine, but it&#39;s not nonexistent. If you had no morals at all, you would not have taken the initiative to show kindness to Axa. I was there, I saw all of that unfold. When she made it clear she didn&#39;t want to be banished--someone with no morals at all would have had no regard for her experience. Someone with no morals at all wouldn&#39;t have even asked her if that&#39;s what she wanted before having it inflicted upon her. Someone with no morals wouldn&#39;t have come to my aid when they saw me trying to get away from someone I was clearly fearful of. Your morals are what guides you to protect Axa, to give her love you know she&#39;s deserving of when nothing else in existence was willing to love her. Your morals are what stopped you from attacking Luka when he found out what Axa was, because you recognized what he had done to protect Axa. It would have gone against the morals you very much do have to disregard the kindness and respect he had paid you by taking a bolt that was aimed for your daughter.&quot; Her words were soft, her tone unthreatening.

&quot;So you&#39;ve killed a lot of people, I presume. How many of them would have died if you <em>didn&#39;t</em> need their lifeforce to sustain yourself? You&#39;re not the first person I&#39;ve been close to who has such blood on their hands, but would have perished without it. Very few people, if any at all, are void of <em>any</em> morals. More commonly, morals just look different from person to person. If you remove the variable of murder, how are you so much worse than the next person? What about yourself do you consider so damning?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“… I apologize. I meant no disrespect,” she said quietly. 

“I… I don’t mean to make it sound like I’m being willfully ignorant of who you really are. I… You’re not someone I would usually mingle with. At least, your lifestyle isn’t one that I think I have any natural involvement in. But that… that doesn’t bother me. You’ve… You’ve always been respectful towards me. Kind, even. You’ve trusted me with important things. You could be the most dangerous and heartless criminal in existence—and I wouldn’t desire to <em>ignore</em> that detail—but all the same, in your own unique, unconventional and indirect way, you are capable of compassion, and you’ve shared that with me. And I know I’m not the only person you’ve shared your compassion with, but I know there probably aren’t many. I know how rare and special that is. And I’m… I’m honored to be allowed those little gestures. I’m—I’m the daughter of an entire <em>god</em>, and I still do whatever I can to help with the pureblooded <em>devil</em> you adopted. Because she <em>is</em> deserving of love, even if she could not be any more drastically different from my own nature. I’m… I know you’re dangerous. But you’ve made it clear that danger is not posed towards me. I’m not choosing to ignore your nature or trying to romanticize it. I just… it doesn’t affect my relationship with you. I don’t judge you for whatever choices you’ve made. All that matters to me is how you treat me and those I care about… and through that lens, you’re a wonderful, beautiful person. That’s enough for me.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Tired of having to always be on his guard, tired of expecting the worst, tired of holding up shields even against the people he should know he could trust to be vulnerable around.

&quot;... Kaleva&#39;s from the north. All of his early life was spent around people who hated him for just being a tiefling. He... didn&#39;t even have a proper childhood. His own mother didn&#39;t want anything to do with him. But he... he always had a little light inside him regardless. The world was so cold to him, but he had so much love to give. He went through so much trauma before I even met him, back when we were teenagers. But he still had that light in him. The year I spent with him in Cautica was... it was like I was alive for the first time. He injected so much vitality into my existence. And even in Cautica, the city wasn&#39;t really... welcoming of him. I first found him lying, beaten and bloodied and riddled with broken bones, in an alley on the poorer side of town. But he was <em>so</em> determined to be okay. To be happy, even if no one liked him. Even if everyone treated him like a criminal, despite the insanely upstanding citizen he was. It was... a really wonderful time for both of us.&quot;

She drifted off a moment, wrapped up in an almost heartsick nostalgia as she returned to those memories, before pulling herself back to the present. &quot;I didn&#39;t know the extent of what happened until more recently. But Oberon... the man who I considered the closest thing I had to a father... he wanted Kaleva gone. I think Kaleva was inspiring too much independence in me for Oberon&#39;s liking. So he worked with the law enforcement in the city to frame Kaleva for murder. I had... I had just bought Kaleva a puppy. He was the happiest I&#39;d ever seen him... and then he just... didn&#39;t come back home from buying supplies. No one told me anything. Oberon tried to lock me in my room so I couldn&#39;t interfere. But I got out, I went to the coliseum... Trials are bloody affairs in Cautica.&quot; That fleeting nostalgia had been replaced with something hollow and lifeless in her tone and on her face. 

&quot;For the most offensive crimes, you can invoke a Trial by Faith. You will fight an Arbiter in one on one combat; if you prevail, it is assumed the gods have judged you as innocent enough to live freely again. But... the Arbiters are powerful warriors trained in nothing but combat from childhood.&quot; She shook her head a little. &quot;It is a death sentence, disguised as a glimmer of hope.&quot;

Her gaze was back in her lap as she continued, slower. &quot;They wanted to see divine intervention as proof of innocence. And I gave them that. I, and my God, blazed into that arena, and the Arbiter and I nearly killed one another before Oberon caught up and stopped the fight.&quot; She paused, before lifting a hand to hook a finger in her collar, pulling the hem of her dress down one shoulder to reveal the gnarled, intense network of heavy scarring there. &quot;If the clerics hadn&#39;t cleaned up my face and hands so I could remain a presentable crown jewel of the temple, I would still be horribly disfigured from it. Not from the Arbiter, but from what my magic did to my own body.&quot; She smoothed her dress back into place.

&quot;I&#39;ve... I&#39;ve never felt such hatred in my life. I wanted to kill everyone in that coliseum. Oberon saw I couldn&#39;t be reasoned with, so he scrambled to give the appearance of saving the day, and arranged for Kaleva to be exiled instead of killed. He didn&#39;t even get to take the puppy I had bought him with him. Those are the details to the story I glossed over last night.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-986419382345424936 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=986419382345424936><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, June 14, 2022 4:58 PM">4:58 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She was quiet a moment, before drawing in a slow breath. &quot;The reason you remind me of Kaleva is because... a decade passed before I saw him again. And in that time apart, he was just as miserable as I was. I think... some of that pervasive light inside him faltered after the coliseum. We still kept in touch however we could at first... and then one day, his letters just never came again. I know now that he had fallen into a gang in Morisdal, lured in by the illusion of kinship, of being a bunch of outcasts all raging against the powers that be. He fell into a life of crime. He was taught how to let out that hurt through rage. Through violence and destruction. He also fell in love with a woman in that gang. And one day, when they were fleeing the guards, the woman who had told him she loved him pushed him into their grasp to ensure her own escape. And then Kaleva spent six years in prison. The gang that he thought were his found family... none of them saved him. None of them tried to help. None of them even tried to visit--except Ingrid,&quot; she added, a soft twitch of a smile briefly on her lips. &quot;Ingrid was in that gang. She knew Kaleva&#39;s girlfriend was a bad person, and she hadn&#39;t believed her when the woman had told everyone Kaleva sacrificed himself willingly. And she manipulated the guards so she could visit Kaleva in prison, and... show him a small measure of kindness.&quot;

The ghost of a smile bled away again. &quot;But Kaleva didn&#39;t say much in return. He was broken at that point. And he continued to break further as the years passed and... horrible, <em>horrible</em> things happened to him in that prison. When he was finally released, the gang was disbanded. He had no one and nothing. A few more years passed, before our paths crossed again. Anubis led me to reunite with him after I was cast out, and... and I almost didn&#39;t recognize the friend I saw. He had finally been hurt so much, that he only knew how to survive by being jaded, paranoid, suspicious, pessimistic. The--The Kaleva you see now... that wasn&#39;t how he always was. He was always a bit introverted, but he used to just... absolutely light up a room in his own, quiet way. He used to be so eager to share the love that was bursting out of him. And... he&#39;s gotten better since we met again. I see that light in him again. I think we managed to catch it before it blinked out completely, and stoke it back into a little glow. He has stability now... safety, security, unconditional love. He&#39;s been able to see so many of his dreams to fruition. And we&#39;re confident we can defend what we&#39;ve worked so hard to obtain. We&#39;re not teenagers anymore. But... I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll ever allow himself to be vulnerable around a stranger again. I don&#39;t think he could bear the risk, because he knows he couldn&#39;t bear for the world to break his heart again.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The way you both expect the worst out of everything so you can&#39;t be let down or surprised with a negative outcome. The way it&#39;s easier for you to withhold all trust than it is to tolerate the possibility of betrayal. The way you have lost the ability to tolerate certain degrees of social intimacy, because... well, I&#39;m... I&#39;m presuming here in regards to yourself. But possibly because of an intolerance for the way it feels to have someone close enough to hurt you. You... You told me you have contingencies in place even for those you hold most dear.

She shrugged a little. &quot;I don&#39;t say any of that from a critical place. We do the best we can with the tools we are given, and our instinctive push for survival leads to things like distrust when we have good reason to believe that lowering our guard is detrimental to our survival. So me implying that you <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> live life as you do would be like me telling you it&#39;s good for you to grab a knife by the blade, when you know very well through your experiences that doing so would harm you. Such a thing isn&#39;t for me to dictate of anyone. But it is... like a cousin of what I have seen within my own best friend. I know it&#39;s kind, because I&#39;ve observed it for a long time now--though it is shaped differently in different people. You are not Kaleva. But both you and Kaleva are shaped, in some degree or another, by the scars the world has placed upon you. Presumably... quite unfairly on almost all occasions. After all... everyone deserves to exist, first and foremost. Everyone deserves a fair shot. Your lives are very different, but it feels like you have that, at least, in common; you were never given the benefit of the doubt. Never given a fair opportunity to just... exist.

A blink, and he focused back on her fully. &quot;Oh, you meant regarding how I&#39;m treated.&quot; Another blink, and a frown. &quot;...Can&#39;t fathom it. Wouldn&#39;t know what to do with it.&quot; Wouldn&#39;t trust it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Would you like to see some of Axa&#39;s other drawings? They&#39;re quite fascinating.&quot; He gestured to the sketchbook, where several other drawings were contained.

One of them being the drawing of Kaleva as seen through Axa&#39;s true sight.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At his offer, her attention easily shifted back to the sketchbook, a part of her wondering if this was some sort of... indirect show of kinship, to share his daughter&#39;s art.

&quot;Oh--certainly. From what I&#39;ve seen of them, fascinating is an understatement.&quot; Reaching forward, she gently pulled the sketchbook closer to herself again, delicately opening it to flip through. 

The majority of Axa&#39;s drawings were of, frankly, horrific glimpses into Hell. Even Skena, with her extensive education on fiends, found herself occasionally struggling to identify them--but she wasn&#39;t exactly disturbed by their depictions, either. After all, she knew very well that Axa had lived in Hell, and the research Skena had done throughout her life was some manner of desensitization to the general scope of the appearance of fiends. She looked through it all with a quietly intrigued expression.

Until she turned the page to not a fiend, but a werewolf. A very familiar werewolf, with horns and long, narrow ears. The intrigue bled out of her expression, gradually being replaced with a calm sort of resignation. She let out a long, slow sigh, glancing up with that resigned look to meet Jaska&#39;s gaze again. It was evident she wasn&#39;t thrilled about this information being in his hands, but the look on her face seemed to say, <em>Okay, you got me. Now please reaffirm I don&#39;t need to worry about this.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

In other words, yes, they were aware, and that information would never be shared or used against them except in the singular event that Skena or Kaleva did something to merit it.

&quot;... She&#39;s... remarkably skilled. I don&#39;t need to tell you that,&quot; she murmured, almost distractedly.

That meant... she was the last one holding on to secrets. That didn&#39;t feel good. Not after someone like Jaska had done something so uncharacteristic as releasing secrets of his own in a show of good faith.

She drew in a slow breath, reaching to set the sketchbook back on the table as she sighed out a long exhale. 

&quot;... When we realized it was you who had been digging for information on me, we did more than just feed back misinformation. I... I genuinely couldn&#39;t figure out <em>why</em> you wanted my secrets. It never occurred to me that you wanted leverage for your own security, because it would have never occurred to me to use your secrets against you. And--I understand if that&#39;s just not something you can easily accept, but all the same, that&#39;s the truth of the matter. My mind doesn&#39;t work through paranoia like that. So I couldn&#39;t understand it.&quot;

Her gaze was still on the drawing of Kaleva, her hands having returned to lightly clasp one another in her lap. &quot;I wasn&#39;t sure how to figure out what you wanted. I didn&#39;t know enough about you. We wracked our minds trying to figure out if there was some... <em>thing</em>, some clue buried in the details of who you were that would explain what you wanted that information for. But I didn&#39;t know enough about you to be able to really guess. And--we knew we didn&#39;t want to touch Valentine with a ten foot pole in any endeavor to learn more about you. But... I hadn&#39;t met Luka yet, at that point. I thought maybe things would make sense if I knew him, and had a fuller picture of your family. It will likely come as no surprise to you that Luka and I naturally got along very well from the start. Which... well, it worked out because... I&#39;m... I&#39;m not really much of an interrogator. If I get any sort of inkling that someone doesn&#39;t want to divulge something, I don&#39;t have the backbone to pry. But Luka... It... He struck me as being so incredibly lonely, having no one to share his problems with except for Valentine. Some people may be immune to such things... I&#39;m not. I invited him over for dinner. And... while the whole venture had begun with the intention of knowing more about you, I can honestly say that once we had gotten to know Luka, there was no manipulation involved. I... I don&#39;t have that kind of thing in me. He insisted on our secrecy, but... I think he&#39;d just... he was starved of having anyone to talk to about his life. He... He didn&#39;t just tell us about your unique inclusion into his family, or about Valentine trapping the aberrant entity.&quot;

She was fidgeting a little, clearly looking ashamed. &quot;We know about the institution. I know... probably more than I should about what was done to you. As... As someone who has studied psychology, the practices they inflicted upon you are... I... Words don&#39;t... I-I was very nearly <em>enraged</em> hearing of it. I... I didn&#39;t want to tell you I knew. I didn&#39;t want to make you uncomfortable, or make you feel like I was pitying you. I wanted it to only ever be brought to light if you, personally, chose to disclose those things to me. It... It was easier to almost feel like it was my business when I wasn&#39;t sure if I could trust you. When I wasn&#39;t sure if you meant me harm, and I needed to know you so I could defend against you. But I... I do trust you. Which makes that knowledge so uncomfortable to carry, because... it doesn&#39;t belong to me. I have no right to it. And... I&#39;m sorry, Jaska. I&#39;m sorry for the role I had in it all.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There was a low curl of anger at Luka, that he would divulge in his experiences who actually knew him. He&#39;d have to browbeat him later, make sure he curbed his tongue against any future stories - particularly if he was going to be spending time with Achoris.

&quot;My anger isn&#39;t with you,&quot; he said slowly, gradually. &quot;It wasn&#39;t Luka&#39;s place to tell, no matter his hand in things. Particularly knowing that you and I were already acquainted. I will speak to him and make sure he doesn&#39;t go spreading that to anyone else. Achoris in particular.&quot;

The tiefling studied her thoughtfully, then smirked. &quot;You might feel bad for the role you had in it, but even though it was at my expense, I can&#39;t help but be impressed that you had the stones to even conceive of such a plan, much less pull it off.

I just wanted things to make sense. I wanted to know why you would care about having dirt on <em>me</em>. Please don&#39;t be horrible to Luka about it, I... maybe I was being more manipulative than I realized. We convinced him it was safe to talk to us. And he only got into the details of things many, many hours into our conversation. I--&quot; she faltered, deflating slightly.

&quot;... It&#39;s your brother. I won&#39;t tell you how to treat him. But I&#39;ll... I&#39;m going to feel awful if my divulging this only serves to torment him. I thought you&#39;d take issue with me, not him.&quot;

She dragged her hands off her face. &quot;... If you&#39;re worried about Achoris, I... truthfully, I think the only reason he has any issue with you at all is because his first impression of you was someone trying to dig up dirt on me, potentially endangering me. I can explain to him you&#39;re not a threat to me. He has no beef with you beyond that. And he&#39;s not trying to get anything out of Luka... he just genuinely likes him. Luka had given me the idea of gifting Achoris seasonings and spices and sauces and the like, things he&#39;d struggle to obtain in his nomadic lifestyle otherwise. Achoris was so appreciative, he inquired about the man who had given me the idea, and--well. It turns out Luka is exactly Achoris&#39; type. I suppose he&#39;s drawn to those more... softspoken, gentle-demeanor men who have that sense of innocence about them. I... I know how Achoris comes off, so before I introduced them I made him promise me that he could take no for an answer if Luka became overwhelmed with his advances, and he promised me. This all came about completely unrelated to the intercepting of your scout. He has no ulterior motives, and I don&#39;t believe even his mischievous nature would prompt him to pry out information not given freely. But I... I can talk to him, if that helps relax you more on the matter.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He considered her posture, her words, and let the silence stretch between them once she&#39;d finished. Just for a few moments. Then, coming to a decision, he reached into his pocket to pull out a little metal cigarette case, popping it open and placing one between his lips. &quot;I believe you. And I can work with that information. I&#39;ll know what to be prepared to defend against, at any rate.&quot; 

He talked around the cigarette easily, and struck a match to light it up, flicking his wrist to douse the match and tilting his head back to exhale toward the ceiling. A terrible habit, but the nicotine did help soothe the low drone of anxiety that had started to creep in, and appeared casual enough to try to mask that the information unsettled him at all.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

More likely, the little devil&#39;s particular cocktail of neurodivergence was such that she was intensely tuned in to tiny deviations from known patterns. But Axa was watching his face--sometimes directly, sometimes indirectly, always looking at something less complicated if his gaze turned to meet hers. And like an animal that could smell fear, she seemed to take notice of the little stirrings of anxiety in her favorite person.

She had finished her second cookie by then, and as he was lighting his cigarette, Axa slithered into his lap--not knowing how to soothe him, other than having been taught that the answer to anxiety was to be near to someone who loved you.

And fortunately, a bit of cigarette smoke was likely one of the least offensive things a child from Hell had breathed in.

Skena&#39;s shoulders sagged a little as he spoke of believing her--relieved, but not enough for it to completely alleviate her of all guilt. &quot;... I am sorry,&quot; she reiterated. &quot;I promise I don&#39;t just spill other people&#39;s secrets to anyone I find conversational. I... to be perfectly honest, there&#39;s not much I keep from Kaleva. But... I get the feeling you know what that&#39;s like when it comes to Valentine.

<em>&#39;She was speaking of elder evils. They are... similar to gods, in a god-adjacent way. Very powerful beings who dominate the far realms. There are elder</em> eternal <em>evils, which are considered primordials. There are also aboleth elder evils, which take many shapes. The Abolethic Sovereignty is led by an entity called the Eldest, from which much of this aberrant influence originates. Elder evils have occasionally infested stars--Hadar amongst them. These far realm-infested stars are always moving in the sky--but Hadar lurks near Ihbar, a light-eating nebula that expands as it consumes. Hadar is sometimes called the Dark Hunger, as in its desperation to sustain itself from its oncoming death, it sent agents, known as the Heralds of Hadar, across existence to feed on life itself, so that the stolen life could sustain Hadar and delay the inevitable. Many warlocks siphon lifeforce back to Hadar without even knowing it. And the Heralds were more than capable of assuming the appearance of mortal men; if you were, previously, a Herald, shoving you into the vessel of a tiefling would have been easy. It--It could even suggest why your lifeforce does not replenish.
