It was in the early stages of twilight, the sky cast in colorful splashes from gold and orange to pinks and purples and finally fading into a deep, starry indigo. The greenhouse he led her to was very well hidden, the frame made of grown trees with twisting branches and roots that supported the panes of glass that would magnify the sunlight and keep the building warm. It was a building that easily blended in with the surroundings, and was difficult to see until you were right upon it.

Jaska paused outside to peer through one of the windows. It seemed they were slightly early, as Hiraeth was still clearly working his magic.

It was the night of a waxing crescent moon, the better for constructive magic, for setting intentions and establishing wealth and success. Hiraeth sat in a circle carved into the earthen floor, with bones, sticks, and flowers lining or making up the various druidic runes and lines of the circle. Five candles surrounded him, the pillars burned down to nubs by this point, and a bowl of water sat in front of him, infused with herbs and gemstones. His arms moved in ritualistic motions, the flames seeming to move along with his hands, the smoke and embers of flame dancing in the air around him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But as was also usual, there was a pleasant little smile on her face, appreciatively soaking in the sights around them through Jaska&#39;s vision. She came with a basket hooked in the bend of her staff-carrying arm, the tiefling herself dressed in layers of cozy clothes to ward off against the wintery chills of the settling evening. 

Axa seemed much more relaxed in general once they were outside of town, though she was still getting used to the world in general. And the cold. Frosty winters were new, and she wasn&#39;t exactly built for them. She had been dressed in layers as well, but the ground was cold on her bare feet, and the crisp night air prickled at her bare tail and the tips of her ears... and so she had refused to leave Valentine&#39;s home without being wrapped up in a stolen blanket.

As they arrived at the greenhouse, Val&#39;s smile grew slightly. &quot;Oh, this is lovely, Jaska. He&#39;s done remarkable. Is this what you had wanted?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

My, those clouds were gathering rather quickly... And almost in an odd sphere in the immediate area around a half mile vicinity. &quot;There&#39;s a cellar underneath where supplies and product will be stored...&quot;

He trailed off, distractedly observing the eight hour ritual reaching a crescendo, the flames from the candles now whipping around him and setting all the wood and flowers in the circle ablaze. Sweat soaked Hiraeth&#39;s skin and had his pale, lichen green hair clinging to his face, and he lifted both arms up above his head, chanting, before both arms swept out and the flames extinguished at once.

In the same moment, thunder boomed and the skies opened up and started an absolute downpour that quickly drenched the tieflings and the devil standing outside. With a curse, Jaska hastily went for the door to usher them inside.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Once inside, Valentine&#39;s tail flicked gently to rid some of the rain from the tuft of hair at its tip, though she&#39;d need her hands free to do the same for the sunrise mane on her head, now made notably flatter with the endured downpour. She said nothing, though, watching Hiraeth whenever Jaska&#39;s gaze included him, as she didn&#39;t want to interrupt his casting.

Hello.&quot; His lips twitched into a smirk as Jaska shook his arms out and swept his hands back flat over his hair to get as much water out as he could. &quot;Sorry. The spell&#39;s conclusion is always a downpour to saturate the land with the magic that will render it fertile.&quot; He paused, adding, &quot;That fertility extends to people caught in the downpour, so be mindful of that if you are not attempting to reproduce.&quot;

Jaska sent Hiraeth a blank look, sighing and going to take the basket from his sister. &quot;Valentine has prepared a meal for you. For all of us, actually.&quot;

Hiraeth&#39;s brows perked at that. &quot;Thank the gods for you, Valentine. I am famished. And thirsty.

Axa looked up, her expression unreadable from under the slickened strings of hair hanging in her face. There was a pause, before she glanced towards Hiraeth, perhaps uncertainly, and then inched forward, turning her attention to the spell components around the druid. 

&quot;<em>Let&#39;s put everything on a table nearby,</em>&quot; Val murmured helpfully, dropping to a knee to set the basket she had brought down, laying her staff flat beside it (the eye now fixated on Hiraeth). &quot;<em>These little pieces of things are easy to pick up, right?</em>&quot;

Axa looked around the little bones and herbs and various other bits, giving another short pause--before said items began to levitate off the ground, one by one floating themselves onto the nearest tabletop surface.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Jaska turned to watch the downpour outside, the sound of it in the trees and leaves and on the glass rather soothing to him, though he hoped it wasn&#39;t too loud for Axa. To Hiraeth, he said, &quot;<em>I can help you get back to the inn when we leave. How long does the rain last?</em>&quot;

Sealed containers of some manner of soup--potentially chicken noodle by the look of it--and slices of grilled cheese sandwiches that looked, frankly, gourmet in quality, along with baked sweet potatoes and little quantities of butter packaged for the small journey. Even a tin of saltine-like crackers to compliment the soup. And, of course, a pitcher of ice water, and a mason jar opposite it in the basket containing what looked to be apple cider.

The matter seemingly settled in her mind, she lowered into a squat next to Jaska, still bundled in the blanket she had absconded from Val’s home with. Her attention turned then to the food, but she merely eyed it without further action.

Val could still see through Jaska’s eyes, but smiled appreciatively all the same at Hiraeth’s descriptions. It was intriguing to hear those descriptions, which she was used to getting (primarily from Luka), while also being able to see what such words translated to visually. As the devil seemed to settle in, Val turned her attention more squarely towards Hiraeth.

“So what sort of things interest you, Hiraeth?” She asked warmly, helping herself to one of the packaged servings of soup with potentially surprising familiarity for someone who couldn’t see it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I enjoy foraging, just for the simple reason that I find it both engaging and rewarding in finding things out in the wilds that I can use or simply collect and enjoy. Or finding hidden places most people wouldn&#39;t find, those secret untouched areas. I like creating things. I like burning them as well.&quot;

Jaska blinked at that. &quot;Please don&#39;t burn down the greenhouse.&quot;

That surprised a laugh out of Hiraeth. &quot;Not like that. Although watching things burn is meditative. I use fire to burn patterns in wood, to create pictures with the scorch marks.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Axa looked over everything the basket had contained, silent and expressionless for a long while. After several minutes had gone by, one of her little pale claws reached out to grab a fistful of Jaska&#39;s sleeve, giving it a single, soft tug.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

While Jaska parented, Hiraeth went on. &quot;Regarding interesting things I&#39;ve found, let&#39;s see... Some old, handmade weapons made of stone, or bone. Arrowheads. Various gemstones. I turned a deer skull I found into a mask that I sometimes wear for rituals.&quot; He added, &quot;Found an aether crystal once, but before I could figure out what to do with it, it was stolen. Pretty much the moment I stepped foot into the city. I suppose crippled druids make for easy targets.&quot; He said the last line with easy good humor of someone who knew his limitations.

&quot;As for places... I profess a fondness for exploring caves in particular. Underground waterfalls and rivers with glow worms hanging from the ceiling filling them with a soft glow, or caves filled with crystals. Long forgotten burial mounds. During a particularly bad storm I wound up taking shelter in a cave that was occupied by a drow who was actually bound and chained within it. He tried to eat me until he realized I was a tiefling, and not the animal I had turned myself into. Turned into quite the abhorrent monstrosity. Apparently he&#39;d been there for a very long time.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I&#39;ve been tempted to circle back around that way from time to time, to check up on him. It seems like he&#39;d be desperate for company, but he rather made me feel like a nuisance. I suppose if anyone barged into my house and decided to wait out a storm there, I&#39;d be a bit miffed too.&quot;

Jaska tilted his head at Axa, but after a long moment it seemed to click for him. She was used to having her food arranged out in front of her, perhaps it hadn&#39;t clicked that she could just take what she wanted. Or more accurately, it was not the way things were done, and it was throwing her off. &quot;<em>Ah. My apologies.</em>&quot; He began to gather food for her, arranging it in front of her and mindful not to let anything touch. &quot;<em>Normally when we eat like this - not at a table - it&#39;s called a picnic, and we typically serve ourselves.

Picking up the provided fork, she began to pick at the sweet potato, scooping some of the pumpkin-colored insides onto the utensil and bringing it to her lips to give an experimental nibble. 

Val was enjoying the view of Jaska&#39;s doting on Axa as she spoke with Hiraeth, but seemed incredibly good at multitasking, following along on their little food adventure without being distracted from what Hiraeth was saying. &quot;Curious.

While Jaska went about crumbling crackers into his soup and starting on that, Hiraeth looked back to Valentine. &quot;Not chained to the point of immobility, mind.

Not horror, not fear, not worry. Just... intensity.

She knew a thing or two about aberrations.

When Hiraeth concluded, she took a moment to digest everything, before drawing in a deep breath to clear her head. &quot;Well. Most people&#39;s appearances are completely lost on me. I can borrow eyesight from someone like my brothers,&quot; she said with a nod in Jaska&#39;s direction, &quot;if they allow it. But it&#39;s not a terribly common thing; I&#39;m perfectly content to live in my little lightless world for the most part. I&#39;ve been around the block my fair share, but simple things, like the physical traits of some races, are wholly foreign to me. This is all to say, there&#39;s only been one drow I&#39;ve previously encountered while I was fortunate enough to be borrowing someone&#39;s vision, and so I was under the assumption <em>all</em> drow likely had strange eyes. But if that&#39;s not the case, if miss Altaira is an unusual case, then... perhaps the <em>other</em> drow with strange voids for eyes could lend some insight on what you might have found.&quot; She gave a little shrug, but the seemingly dismissive gesture did nothing to shake the burning curiosity out from beneath her eyes.

&quot;I admittedly know very little about the Kryn, but I <em>do</em> know that Altaira is a Kryn of extraordinary rank amongst Xhorhasians. She has also lived much longer than I, and has many more sources of intel than a simple barkeep, so if this mystery is still lingering in your mind--even if she was not also a drow with bizarre, dark voids for eyes, I would suggest you see what information she might offer.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Hiraeth looked back to her with a small grin, reaching up to push his glasses back up on his nose. &quot;I grew up with a rather large family. Siblings fight, I get it. Yours was just a lot more quiet than I&#39;m accustomed to.&quot;

The little flame stuck its arms out from between her fingers and waved them around, but it did not try to escape from her hold. She could pick it up, mostly because that&#39;s what Hiraeth wished for it to do. It felt like a warm tickle against her palms, but otherwise insubstantial, like holding air. &quot;It&#39;s a combination of two cantrips. I can produce and control flames. I can attack with it if necessary, but until I dictate for it to turn into a weapon, it does not singe or burn anything. It&#39;s simply a warm light.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She chuckled softly out loud. &quot;We have... our own ways of settling matters. At least, I do. When it is both of my brothers at odds with each other, it&#39;s far more vocal.&quot;

She tilted her head slightly, watching as Axa snatched up the fiery entity. And gave it a little squeeze. She may have been immune to fire, but she could still tell that this one felt different. Weaker, perhaps. Colder than flames typically felt when she touched them. Also, fire generally did not interact with her like a little creature. She was struggling to make it make sense.

&quot;Very charming indeed,&quot; Val continued, watching the little encounter through Jaska&#39;s eyes. &quot;Though I don&#39;t believe you would need to worry about burning little Axa. She&#39;s probably tougher than the lot of the rest of us combined.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her little claws flexed against the ground, scraping the surface of the greenhouse floor. It didn&#39;t make sense. He was just saying things that contradicted each other, and she didn&#39;t know how to unravel those concepts and decipher his meaning. She couldn&#39;t follow half his guidance without infringing on the rest. 

All she could do was fail. 

As she stared at Jaska, her expression remaining mostly stoic, there became fissures in that stoicism. Like roots rapidly growing beneath a tree, the pupils of her eyes darkened, before fracturing out into tendrils that consumed her eyes, spilled out of them, and split across her face like the tangles of a lightning bolt. Her jaw fell slack--and then continued to fall, unhinging fully and seeming in danger of melting off her face as the black tendrils snaked across the surface of her skin, staining her pale features like ink. And as her mouth flexed open in an anatomically impossible manner... a previously unseen pharyngeal jaw extended forward from the blackened void of her throat, lined in countless razor sharp teeth to add to the set of teeth she already had on full display. 

The air around her had gone still and thin, as if stripped of oxygen--and now possessing a faint odor of something smoldering. From within the void of her almost inverted throat came an unnaturally deep, eerie clicking sound, like the rumbling threat of a crocodile. 

It didn&#39;t make sense... and she was contractually bound to not kill the source of her distress.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, February 4, 2022 11:13 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Hiraeth was not quite as comfortable with sitting still in the proximity of... what was suddenly very obviously <em>not</em> a tiefling. He whispered a short incantation in druidic, and his ash gray skin seemed to harden and become covered with rough, craggy cracks as seen upon the bark of a tree. He began easing back and away from them, scooting backwards on his butt, trying to move slowly and not attract attention.

&quot;Axa?&quot; Jaska murmured quietly, staring into the face of her meltdown, schooling himself into a calm, collected expression. &quot;I see that something I said was upsetting.

Intrigued, but she didn&#39;t seem even slightly disturbed. Probably par for the course.

Axa didn&#39;t know how to express herself at the best of times--and this was far from the best of times. Her warped head twisted slightly askew on her neck, fingers that now looked like wicked, gnarled talons scraping at the ground. Her tail didn&#39;t so much lash behind her, but more jittered erratically, contorting periodically as if it were some sort of serpent writhing in pain. 

She didn&#39;t want to fail, but she didn&#39;t see any path forward that didn&#39;t end in her failure, and it had instantly ramped up her anxiety. A hoarse, inhuman sort of whining noise stirred behind the rumbling clicking sounds she was producing, but... she didn&#39;t seem to be actually taking any actions. She didn&#39;t attack, she didn&#39;t throw things or physically lash out--and fortunately for Hiraeth, she didn&#39;t seem to even be cognizant of his presence in that moment. But the hellish display didn&#39;t go away, actually gradually getting worse, if anything. 

After a second, a gentle voice returned to Jaska&#39;s mind. <em>&#39;... Didn&#39;t you tell me she had gotten hung up on feeling like she had to be useful to you? Only seeming to be in a decent mood once she had killed someone? You described play as something that makes her happy, but also as something done without the intent to cause harm.

&quot;Our family&#39;s been around the block, so to speak,&quot; she murmured after a moment&#39;s consideration. &quot;But I think, by now, we have a fair grasp on what we&#39;re doing. This little one&#39;s been an interesting learning experience, but she is truly a part of the family and well loved,&quot; she continued with a slight nod towards the doting father. &quot;She is not some volatile asset. Just a young viper, not yet grown enough to fully control its venom. But learning every day under patient guidance and compassion. All is well, I assure you.&quot;

She paused, before flashing a grin in Hiraeth&#39;s direction. &quot;I&#39;m not particularly fussed about meeting your aberrant friend,&quot; she added pointedly.

Axa, meanwhile, was slowly calming into a listless sort of misery. She was still confused, still didn&#39;t know what the right answer was, but... soothed by Jaska&#39;s embrace, and the reassurance that she didn&#39;t have to provide an answer at all. All that was left was the distant awareness of the stranger&#39;s recoiling from her, and the uncertainty haunting her that she had ruined something of value to her adoptive father.

A pause, before she tilted her head thoughtfully. &quot;And Jaska has a point. You should forge alliances wherever you can. Who knows what this <em>acquaintance</em> of yours could provide you with. Elves live such long lives, and one that has found himself in such a situation... who&#39;s to say what knowledge he bears. What power, even. Secrets.&quot; Though the words were rather scheming, her carefree tone and light, effortless demeanor made them sound like silly gossip; it was hard to tell how earnestly she meant it, or if this was her merely joking around.

&quot;Stranger things have been trapped in stranger prisons,&quot; she continued, that pleasant smile on her face, even as the slit pupil in the eye of her staff stared unwaveringly directly into Hiraeth&#39;s face. &quot;But such situations are often fascinating stories in the end.

The following day had been a bedridden one for Hiraeth, his chronic pain compounded after having sat in the same position for eight hours straight. But eventually his body had given him a break, and the day after that he was tentatively up and moving about again, stretching and gently exercising his bad leg. A visit to Luka and a hot bath afterward had done much to restore his mobility, and by late afternoon he had made his way to the guild hall.

Anyone who had any sort of garden, vegetables or fruiting plants within half a mile of the original ritual would have found their plants had flourished seemingly overnight. The grass was thicker and greener, the trees and flowers and shrubs lush and healthy. Even those that had wilted under unskilled hands were suddenly restored. It was probably fairly easy to determine that a druid had blessed the area.

The light clack of Hiraeth&#39;s staff upon the floor accompanied the scuff of soft leather boots on the guild hall&#39;s floors, and upon reaching Altaira&#39;s door, he knocked lightly with his staff, tapping twice.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sort of. It was really not helping her ego, which was already borderline problematic.

But Hiraeth would likely never know about this event. Instead, there was a smooth, deep voice from within the door he knocked upon that politely bid him to enter. Assuming he did so, he would find the brick shithouse of a drow seated at her desk, dressed in a knit robe over a very simple arrangement of clothes that seemed to suggest she was only just waking up, despite the hour.

Her unnerving void-like gaze settled on the druid as he limped in, a small, serene smile on her face in polite greeting. 

“Good afternoon. I do not believe I have had the pleasure of making your acquaintance?” She observed in an even tone, setting aside a steamy mug and rising to her feet to greet him with proper manners.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She unhurriedly took a drink, then set the mug aside again, lifting a hand to rub her temple as she muttered a few grumbling words in undercommon.

But there are no forbidden magics; not amongst my people. Knowledge is everything,&quot; she said, leaning forward to rest her forearms on the desk as she spoke, &quot;and it is the burden of the consecuted to collect all knowledge that can be gathered. Indiscriminately. And yet, there are some things in this world that are better left undisturbed. Things that latch onto naivete and curiosity, things that are drawn towards those with a thirst for more than they have. Things that infect such individuals, and destroy them from the inside out. There are things we do not understand, and we <em>should not</em> understand--for to understand them is to be destroyed by them. Better men than Valkyn have stared into the abyss and thought they could tame it, and all of them amounted to naught but cautionary tales. I am consecuted while Valkyn rots in a cave because he succumbed to his overzealous ambition, and thought he was different from those who went before him, thought he could harness the abyss for his own; I looked the abyss in the eye, and knew when to blink.&quot;

As she spoke, those voids where her eyes should have been seemed even deeper and more lightless than usual, subtle glimmers of far off nebulas swirling ambiguously in their depths. And the more Hiraeth paid mind to it, the more he would likely notice the similarities in her facial structure to that of Valkyn himself. 

But perhaps all drow looked alike. 

&quot;But we live long lives,&quot; she continued after a pause, the slight intensity in her demeanor easing back some. &quot;My consecution grants me the promise of reincarnation when this life has run its course. Valkyn will likely outlive this life of mine, and possibly even the next as well; he has no promise of reincarnation, but its been noted that one ceases to age after one&#39;s own death. So unless his foolishness brings him to a premature end, he has many centuries to learn form his mistakes. He was once a great asset to the kryn. Unconventional, perhaps, in some of his pursuits--but he had true potential. All of which he has presently squandered.&quot; She paused to take another long sip of her coffee.

&quot;But... as stated, there are many years in the life of an elf. And after a certain age, you ought to know better than to assume things of the future. It is possible for him to find redemption, to turn the disaster of his life around. But he is disowned from Den Zauviir and exiled from Xhorhas. With luck, the centuries have given him time to reflect, for his wisdom to ripen, so that should he exit his imprisonment, that naive flame of ambition has been sufficiently tempered, and he does not simply run back to the same pursuits that created his predicament in the first place.&quot;

She gave a small shrug of one shoulder. &quot;I did not choose his sentence, nor was I at all a part of the decision. But I understand the queen&#39;s caution. Something we do not understand bled into existence through him; the quarantine was warranted.&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Tuesday, September 12, 2023 2:25 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It is possible to die, but instead of following the typical path of events in such a case, to have extraordinary forces… <em>eject</em> you from the natural way of things. There is life, where we age until we die, and then there is death, where we decay and return to the soil. If a soul is disrupted from this cycle at the time of death, it may instead be frozen outside of those more transient phases. He will likely never age in body, nor die of old age, but I very much doubt his body will rot as if it were a corpse. A word in common that is occasionally used to describe individuals like himself is <em>revenant</em>. One who has died, but returned from such a state—changed, but otherwise still themselves. This is different from reanimation, as that implies a necromantic magic giving a corpse the ability to operate as though it were alive. In those cases, however, the soul remains in the afterlife, and the reanimated corpse is not truly the person it once was. Valkyn, I suspect, retains his soul. But I believe it has been mutated along with his corporeal body, becoming something abnormal to the natural order of things.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Unless there have been drastic developments in the centuries since I last saw him, he is not inherently dangerous. Whether or not that remains the truth depends entirely upon whether or not he has moved on from his prior fixations. Let me be clear, Hiraeth; I do not answer your questions as a means of gossiping. His has become one of the many cautionary tales remembered by our Den. I explain his fate as a precaution against others needlessly falling to the same temptations. I have no interest in policing who does or does not interact with the fool. But should you mingle with him, it would behoove you to understand the precipice he once teetered on, and to be wary should you ever see evidence he is there once again. If he is drawn to that lure again, even after this extended quarantine of his... well. Were I in your position for such a circumstance, I would kill him.&quot;

She was quiet a moment, the words hanging heavily in the air, before she continued. &quot;I am no governing body in this city, but as an emissary, of sorts, for my people beyond my homeland, hazards such as the one he has the potential to be are my obligation to intervene upon if necessary. As such, I wish to be clear that he is not welcome in Fielbarry.&quot; The words were not aggressive, but they were heavy and firm and offered no room for a counterargument. 

&quot;But I will not instruct you on your own choices. Nor do I fault you for your curiosity. Curiosity is a thing of brilliance... but it sometimes pays to temper such things.&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Tuesday, September 12, 2023 2:28 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It spoke for Hiraeth&#39;s mindset. Oh, he tried to eat me? Well that&#39;s okay, circle of life and all that. But if he corrupts the forest and gets his goopy shit on everything all bets are off.

&quot;I like to think my curiosity has been appropriately tempered since the days of my more reckless youth. Its current levels haven&#39;t given me any grief, at any rate.&quot; Hiraeth smiled, dipping his chin slightly. &quot;I do thank you for your caution and advice, Altaira. Your words will be at the forefront of my mind in the event I do visit him again.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
