His expression softened as he spooned tea leaves into a little mesh basket and put it in the glass kettle. &quot;... Thank you, by the way.

It worked out for me as well, I wasn&#39;t exactly keen on staying there either... Plus, I didn&#39;t want to see you spill your wine.&quot;

His gaze slid from Luka to the tea, admiring the glass kettle. &quot;What&#39;re you brewing? Chamomile?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Luka trailed off as the events came back to him, Yarrow&#39;s behavior in particular. &quot;...Are you okay? You seemed tense, I wasn&#39;t sure if it was in response to what was going on.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Tea was probably the correct answer, what with it&#39;s calming and decidedly non-alcoholic properties. Then he remembered that familiar face amidst the tension, the slightest scrunch on his face. &quot;More wine for me, I think. I&#39;m not terribly picky though, especially if it&#39;s free. As long as it&#39;s got alcohol in it I&#39;ll drink it.&quot;

Are you okay?
Oh Luka. If only you knew. Yarrow&#39;s first instinct at the question was to smile and laugh again, that original downtrodden look haunting his eyes. He gave a tiny shake of his head, draining the last of the glass before shrugging. &quot;Well all <em>that</em> certainly didn&#39;t help. I just saw...&quot;

His face scrunched again, something twisting in his gut. It&#39;d gnaw at him until he knew more. &quot;Where did... Who is..?&quot; He gestured vaguely for a moment before raising his unoccupied hand to his forehead, mimicking an eye.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He uncorked it, pausing at the other man&#39;s question, and it took him a moment to understand who he was referring to. &quot;Oh, Petra? They showed up only recently. Old friend of Mahva&#39;s, I believe. From what I understand, they&#39;re here looking for a fresh start, and Valentine took them on as a bouncer.&quot;

He reached out to gently take Yarrow&#39;s glass, refilling it and passing it back to him. &quot;You&#39;ve met them before?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was a ironic twist of fate that the pair had come to Fielbarry for the same fresh start, far, far from home. The mention of Mahva only furthered another rusted cog in his mind, a tick of understanding in a machine he&#39;d purposefully rotted.

He breathed a quiet thanks as Luka refilled his glass, taking a much needed gulp before clearing his throat enough to answer. From his expression, it was clear the answer was some sort of <em>&#39;yes, but.&#39;</em>

&quot;I mean. I&#39;ve never seen... They didn&#39;t. <em>look</em> like that before. I uh, don&#39;t know what all that&#39;s about.&quot;

Hastily, he added &quot;Nor do I want to. Looking at them just reminds me of things I&#39;d rather forget.&quot; Despite his words, he knew it&#39;d still gnaw at him anyways. &quot;... You said they were Mahva&#39;s friend?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He cupped both hands around the porcelain and sipped delicately at it, lowering his eyelids. &quot;I guess they&#39;re friends? I only know what Valentine picked up on, which is that Mahva was wary of their arrival at first, but after feeling things out he seemed confident they could be trusted.&quot;

He smiled a touch then. &quot;Petra&#39;s position is both an opportunity to give them a fresh start, and a means to keep an eye on them, I think. Mahva does a lot to bring customers to the tavern, and Valentine will protect him fiercely for that. I know he&#39;s in danger from his own people.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He cleared his throat lightly, trying to chase away the feeling even as his sprawled out in in the seat in a lazy stretch, one leg kicking up to rest on a knee. 

&quot;He&#39;s in danger? They&#39;ve got some crazy rules from down there, if I remember right. Guess that doesn&#39;t surprise me.&quot; He turned over Luka&#39;s words in his head for a moment before his brow furrowed. &quot;You don&#39;t mean anybody&#39;s actually coming after him, do you?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That seems to have bought him quite a bit of time, as that happened... a while ago, now. But he is still being hunted, yes.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I&#39;d hate to be in his shoes... Or whatever the equivalent is. Lucky him Ingrid was there then.&quot;

He sat back in his chair, mulling it over. He didn&#39;t like it. He could care less whether or not other people were in danger, but their dangers were far too close to his own in the most inconvenient ways for him to just ignore it and move on. He dragged a hand down his face with a grumble. &quot;I might have to do some digging then.. see if I can. <em>Help.</em> or something. Maybe.&quot;

He sighed, shaking his head with a chuckle. &quot;I must make for a poor excuse of an adventurer if I&#39;m sitting here complaining about having to help people, huh?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He would be grateful.&quot;

There was a brief pause, and then he let out a muffled little snort of amusement. &quot;If nothing else, you could probably get a steep discount on those happy ending massages you were inquiring about earlier.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There was usually money too, but Yarrow&#39;d barely gone on any missions, and thus had to scrape by through other means. Usually that meant mooching or odd jobs. He briefly wondered if solving an assassination problem constituted as a guild mission, and if they&#39;d pay him for it too before deciding that was too optimistic for him.

&quot;Speaking of massages, did you still want one? Offer&#39;s still on the table, as is the disclaimer. Tea seems to be doing it for you though.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It looked far more pleasant and well cared for than his own hair. Even without the stray vines, it looked far more a mess.

&quot;Funny. You look far more angelic than I ever could, even with horns and a tail. You sure you&#39;re a tiefling?&quot; He teased.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Nah, it&#39;s fine. And not quite. I&#39;m an aasimar of Ozymanthios. Old bastard of a boar from the north...

He shook his head, snorting bitterly. A hand reached up to his hair, and with a short grimace plucked free one of the strands of vine interweaving it to show off. &quot;He&#39;s still around, in a way, though he&#39;s never given me anything good.

Which bore about a dozen stab wounds. 

She tilted her head slightly in hesitation as she entered, but only for a moment before closing the door behind her. She had not even considered that Yarrow would <em>stay</em> in her home after dropping Luka off. Then again... what little she heard as she entered placed Luka&#39;s tone of voice in a much better mood than he had left in. 

&quot;... Thank you for keeping Luka company, Yarrow,&quot; she said after a brief moment of trying to figure out the best icebreaker.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

On one hand, she could foresee Jaska objecting to Luka reading of what had happened to him. On the other... it happened, to a lesser extent, to <em>Luka,</em> too. She wasn&#39;t sure where the line should be. 

She did not immediately move to summon the torn pages. Normally, she would reach out to Jaska&#39;s mind to ask him in such matters... but she did not expect he was in a reasonable state of mind at the moment. Drawing in a slow breath, she finally responded. 

&quot;... Jaska has done much to open up to me about what he endured, relatively recently. Even so far as to allow me to magically share the memories he bore, to experience them for myself as if they were my own. When asked, he told me I did not have his blessing to offer to share those with you, though.&quot; She still held those secrets close--directly over her heart, in the form of the amethyst pendant they were encased and encoded in--and would honor her promise to him to take them to her grave if his consent never changed. Her words were slow and careful, doing her best to gauge what would be acceptable to share without breaching that trust.

&quot;... Admittedly... I... don&#39;t know if he would object to you reading those records. I... very much want to oblige you. To give you whatever you need for your own healing and growth. I think... you have a degree of entitlement to that information. You were there. Directly involved. More so than I have any entitlement to it.&quot; As she spoke, her multitasking mind was processing Jaska&#39;s side of things. He hadn&#39;t wanted Luka to know, specifically, how scared and powerless he had been. Things that would be conveyed through sharing his own memories. Things that were <em>not</em> innately a part of an observation written by a third party. 

Perhaps this was a happy medium. &quot;Happy&quot;, of course, being used in the loosest sense of the word. Luka could have insight to what truly happened, without being shown the deepest vulnerabilities that his brother did not want shared. Valentine let out a long, slow breath as she gradually made up her mind, deciding the likelihood that this would cause problems was low enough for her to take the chance. 

&quot;I do not know what are on these pages,&quot; she finally said, her hand turning palm-up as more dripping strings of ichor apparated and congealed into a flat shape in her hand, the blackness then melting away to leave the pages, all still folded in half, resting lightly in her grasp. &quot;I do not intend to keep any secrets from Jaska. But you must promise me you will not treat him differently. Nothing will repulse him more than to be pitied. Nothing else would invite conflict faster. If you read these, you must promise me to not look upon him with sympathy, but with respect. Otherwise, I do not believe he would condone me handing these over.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Under other circumstances he&#39;d have insisted on waiting for Jaska&#39;s permission, but... Valentine was right. He had a right to know. He was involved in all of it too. And while Jaska bore the mental scars of what had been done, he bore the physical. Not just the ones Jaska left on him. Jaska got a new body free from the effects of the tortures they had done. Luka had been healed, certainly, but there were things magic simply wasn&#39;t designed to heal. And a body that is killed several times over and resurrected repeatedly over the span of a few short years would of course have some lingering effects.

He went to go sit down, pages in hand, and began to read through them. He felt curiously numb throughout it, distant from himself.

It was a while before he finally murmured, &quot;There is a poet who is known for a particular quote... &#39;Most of the evil in this world is done by people with good intentions.&#39; I feel it apt here.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;... Then I am proud of you, for the strength it takes to face that. But when we know better, we do better. You know better now. And you have done better. Acknowledge your shortcomings with grace. Just do not use them as a vessel to hate yourself in any capacity.&quot; She tilted her head to kiss his temple.

&quot;... Jaska asked me, in a pot-induced haze, to help him make sense of your behavior. He said that even though you were not conscious for the worst of things, you suffered many side effects along with him. He couldn&#39;t comprehend how you could not withdraw from that arrangement voluntarily, how you still trusted them even as you suffered. What I told him was that when Axa lost her tooth, he took her to Skena faster than any of us could intervene. When she told him all children lose their baby teeth, he was <em>incredulous</em>, that concept being absolutely alien to him--but no part of him questioned her. I asked him that if Skena informed him he had to carve off sections of his own flesh in a procedure to aid his daughter, if she explained it in a way that made sense to him, would he doubt her? Or would he blindly accept her guidance and maintain the trust he placed in her amidst a matter he was scared and clueless in? When I explained that, he understood immediately. In that hypothetical, he would be making a mistake. Harming himself, possibly even Axa, thinking he was helping. Even if he were not my dearly beloved brother, I would hesitate to label such a mistake as an act of <em>evil</em>. Such a word carries with it an implication of a conscious choice. Knowing right from wrong, and choosing wrong. You made a mistake, darling. A grievous one with lasting consequences. One might even argue you were foolish and naive. But I don&#39;t know if that makes you evil, sweet brother.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As Luka peeled back the blanket, it wouldn&#39;t be hard to spot what Val&#39;s keen senses had picked up on; the girl was seemingly wringing her hands in arduously slow movements, dragging her claws in as she did so.

The Problematic Floor did not go away, and though the sickly fingers that had been produced did not seem to have much in the way of grip strength, they continued to insistently try to pull anything they could grip down towards the floor. Axa was not really relaxing, either, and after a tense moment, she shot off the couch in an unnaturally fast blur, coming to a stop again atop one of the kitchen cabinets. And the figure that could be viewed sitting there was... wrong. In a way that was hard to describe. Maybe the features on her face and body seemed to occasionally slip out of position slightly, like an optical illusion. Maybe proportions were just slightly not what they should have been. Sometimes her pupils were missing. Sometimes the inside of her mouth was Too Black as she kept her teeth bared towards her uncle and aunt. It was like a reflection in a mirror that began to warp in low lighting, filling you with dread despite the visage being of a familiar face.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was promptly followed by little shrieks, like the startled release of hellish birds, as three imps were dragged onto the material plane against their will. Half-words were sputtered in infernal, but the creatures barely had a chance to come to rest on the new plane before Axa had pounced on one. In the same motion, one of the kitchen knives had removed itself from the block it was sheathed in, whipping up through the air and into the little girl&#39;s hand, so that she was already armed as soon as the imp was pinned beneath her. At which point she wasted no time in repeatedly driving the knife down into the screaming, writhing fiend with unsettling fury for a child, spraying the upper corner of the wall in visceral splashes of crimson.

The other two imps, promptly realizing that they had been summoned for slaughter, shrieked and took off away from her, leathery wings flapping chaotically like two large bats had been trapped inside the small home. But there weren&#39;t many places for them to go, though one briefly tried the front door before finding it locked and moving on in a panic. 

Valentine listened to this chaos break out with only brows slightly raised. &quot;... Good guess,&quot; she noted to her brother over the gargling, dying screams of the imp and the panicked chittering of its companions.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Axa&#39;s onslaught stilled, and she sat there, looking dazed (and blood-soaked) as she suddenly found herself feeling lost and floating aimlessly. Calm, but... missing something important in her psyche. Clueless. Her anxiety was gone, but in it&#39;s place was an adrift uncertainty.

The imp under her, however, was most decidedly dead. Or very nearly about to be, as its blood streaked down the edges of the cabinet. The two surviving imps calmed their chattering, the one Luka had not commandeered fluttering to perch more civilly on a shelf, blinking slowly as it looked over the other inhabitants, while the imp Luka was protecting finally shut its mouth, owlish eyes watching Luka curiously. It was almost kind of cute.

Val felt the magic tug at her psyche, and contemplated heeding it for a moment, before deciding to shrug it off instead. If something went awry, she preferred to not have her wings clipped should action be needed of her.

&quot;That is a transient solution, brother,&quot; she reminded gently, locating the mug of tea Luka had previously made for himself and taking a sip of it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He strode rapidly to the bedroom with the imp in his arms, closing the door behind him, and heading to the window to open it.

&quot;Fly far from here, quickly as you can,&quot; he said to the imp. &quot;She won&#39;t harm me, but that doesn&#39;t mean she won&#39;t find a gap to slip a knife into. You have forty seconds before it wears off. <em>Go.</em>&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He paused, however, whipping back around to perch on the window sill momentarily, giving Luka what was probably intended to be a very big grin, but ended up being an expression the creature&#39;s face was not designed to make pleasantly.

Souls were the currency of Hell, and the less likely that soul was to end up there on its own, the more valuable it was if corrupted. 

As they dwelled on that note a moment, the minute of artificial calm slipped away. And as Axa regained the stress she had momentarily lost, she slowly tensed up again, her body quivering slightly. And then she started crying.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her complexion had flushed pink around her bloodshot eyes and nose, her face twisted in misery from its usual expressionless mask. She didn&#39;t say anything, but also didn&#39;t concoct new horrors to try to scare Luka, just watching him without seeming to really see him as she sobbed.

In the background, the remaining imp--also no longer artificially calmed, and fully tuned in to the danger it was in once more--was trying to find a way to stay unnoticed and find some manner of safety.

But the imp was having trouble with the closed door, and a little click of the handle as he fiddled with it drew Axa&#39;s attention again, despite the creature&#39;s best efforts. With a sudden snarl, the knife shot through the air like a bullet, skewering through the imp&#39;s neck and into the door behind it. The creature flailed for a moment in shocked pain, but the blade severing through its neck immediately cut off its life. Only a second or two later, the little body went slack to hang from where the knife pinned it against the door.

Hands now empty, Axa curled to turn her face against Luka&#39;s chest, the snarl subsiding back to sobs.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Jaska let himself into the apartment quietly, mindful to try not to wake the sleeping occupants in the living room. His gaze raked over Axa and Luka, and for a moment his features hardened as a surge of possessive jealousy washed over him. His tail twitched sharply, lips pressing into a thin line, but he turned to take in the state of the place. &quot;...Another summoning, I take it.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In some places, that meant tiny little rat-paw toeprints in blood, which was rather cute, despite the rest of the scene.

Val stood quietly as Jaska helped himself inside, a gentle smile on her face. &quot;Another? How frequent are these?&quot; She mused, heading towards the closed door the dead imp was pinned to.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ignoring the skewered imp, she carefully opened the door to the mostly unused bedroom--though the click of the latch sliding free was enough to rouse one of the sleeping parties. Barely a second passed between the sound, and a sudden, almost frantic attack on Jaska as a bleary-eyed and still very bloodstained Axa forcefully shot out of Luka&#39;s lap--potentially scratching him in the process, like a scrambling animal--crawled up his body and into his arms before they were even prepared to hold her. Val paused as she heard this take place, smiling softly as she lingered in the doorway a moment to give them a chance to reunite.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Good morning, Luka. And Axa,&quot; Val murmured warmly, unable to deny the release of tension in the room as Axa&#39;s source of anxiety melted away. The atmosphere of delicately balancing on eggshells melted away with it. And as the seconds passed, the little girl&#39;s death grip on her father gradually began to relax, bit by bit.

Opening the door fully, Val stepped inside and headed towards the window. It was closed, but on the outside sill, a magpie was perched, head cocked to stare into the room with one eye at a time.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Morning,&quot; Luka murmured blearily, rubbing at his eyes and yawning, then grimacing and rubbing at his leg where little claws had dug in for traction as she launched away. &quot;What time is it...?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The bird eyed the room behind her, but didn&#39;t hesitate long before hopping directly onto her hand. 

Axa gradually relaxed more and more, sinking in against him with an almost homesick neediness. As her stranglehold on him eased, she settled in with her cheek against his shoulder, arms wrapped snugly around him so she was holding herself to him just as much as he was holding her against him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Jaska stirred the hot chocolate as it warmed up, looking to the mess of the imp, murmuring to Axa, &quot;Did you do that?&quot; But instead of saying it like it was a bad thing, he asked her like it was an art project. &quot;Such a strong girl.

&quot;Axa, this one is under my protection, alright, dear?&quot; She called towards the kitchen--which actually was enough to draw Axa&#39;s attention up over Jaska&#39;s shoulder momentarily. Her gaze landed on the magpie, expressionless though it was, and elicited a very nervous-looking shuffle from the bird. But Axa said nothing, and emoted nothing. She seemed to care far less about the imp with Jaska back. 

&quot;Instead of having our new friend out loose in the world like a feral cat, I think we&#39;ll put him to good use. I&#39;ve been speaking with Szix throughout the night, and he is willing to bind himself to our collective family&#39;s service.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Jaska glanced over, staring for a long moment at the magpie. He did some quick mental work of the scene and the words spoken, and realized after a moment that &#39;Szix&#39; referred to the magpie that was not a magpie but an imp. &quot;Interesting.

&quot;Anything you need! Everything anything at all. Helping hand, helping sting--good sneak! Great sneak! Spy! Thief! All of the above! Very discreet--&quot; his voice cut off as his anatomy warped again, and in a blink, he was--gone? 

No, there was a small red and black spider perched on Val&#39;s finger in his place.

Axa quickly lost interest in the imp, curled up comfortably on Jaska&#39;s lap--and actually now feeling well enough to take the offered sip of hot chocolate.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1040510793487228948 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1040510793487228948><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, November 10, 2022 10:18 PM">10:18 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">[CW spider photo, nothing gnarly tho]</code></span></div><div class="chatlog__attachment chatlog__attachment--hidden" onclick=showSpoiler(event,this)><div class=chatlog__attachment-spoiler-caption>SPOILER</div><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1036892748827082822/1040510793076199434/SPOILER_unknown.png?ex=65604030&amp;is=654dcb30&amp;hm=02771608d4a896b7a5ab7f48c7a0d81eac0c86dfa5ef24af48966c208e80291a&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1036892748827082822/1040510793076199434/SPOILER_unknown.png?ex=65604030&amp;is=654dcb30&amp;hm=02771608d4a896b7a5ab7f48c7a0d81eac0c86dfa5ef24af48966c208e80291a&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: SPOILER_unknown.png (616.77 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

After Axa had a good sip, he took a sip of some himself, just sharing it back and forth between them.

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll find plenty of ways Szix can help us out.&quot; Luka tipped his head as he looked to the spider on Valentine&#39;s finger. &quot;The weather will be turning quite cold soon.

Val idly bounced him on her hand like a parrot, the imp bobbing up and down similarly. &quot;It&#39;s not so much that Szix can do things that we could not manage on our own. But who knows what use he may prove to be. I think I&#39;ll quite enjoy having him help bus tables, if absolutely nothing else.&quot; Her head tipped thoughtfully towards her younger brother. 

&quot;And he may be able to attend missions with you under the guild where Axa could not. There is a reason many spellcasters summon familiars for themselves. It can prove useful to have a little creature at your disposal. A spider, after all, could probably slip through a keyhole undetected. And he&#39;s expendable,&quot; she continued easily. &quot;If destroyed on this plane, as his little friends were, he&#39;ll regrow in Hell, where Axa can then summon him back to us. For our purposes, he&#39;s as good as immortal. Isn&#39;t that right, Szix?&quot;

The imp nodded insistently, still bearing that appeasing, slightly awkward grin. &quot;Of course! Whatever is wished of Szix!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Szix gave Luka&#39;s hand an earnest shake, eyes squinted to yellow slivers in his persistent grin. &quot;Thank you! Thank you! Very honored.&quot;

&quot;Yes! Yes! Of course, whatever you need!&quot; Szix agreed easily, quickly releasing his hand to allow him to depart. 

&quot;Don&#39;t suppose you&#39;ve ever cleaned dishes in Hell, have you, Szix?&quot; Val mused wryly.

The imp looked back to her, blinking owlishly once. He hesitated long enough in replying that Val took that as an answer, sighing. &quot;Ah, well. It&#39;s entry-level work that teenagers are often tasked with in their first jobs, so if you can&#39;t figure it out, that will be immensely disappointing.&quot;

&quot;Szix will learn! Whatever you ne--&quot;

&quot;Yes, alright. Let&#39;s temper the enthusiasm a bit, dear.&quot; Taking a few steps, she set him aside on a shelf, heading into the kitchen to make herself some tea for breakfast. &quot;We&#39;re not a gaggle of fools. All of us are quite aware how you operate, so we need not waste energy on the exaggerated <em>willingness to serve</em>, yes?&quot; Her tone remained light and friendly, even as the words themselves were stripped of some patience. &quot;Whatever happens to our souls when we perish, there are various entities that dwarf you considerably that are ahead of you in line to claim them.&quot;

Szix crawled to the end of the shelf to keep his attention on her as she addressed him, some of that ear-to-ear grin easing back considerably into just a quietly respectful expression as he nodded along easily. &quot;Yes--Yes, of course, mistress. Szix will enjoy time spent serving you and will <em>not</em> be exaggerated. Of course. Of course. Always.&quot;

Val&#39;s eye twitched slightly, unsure how she felt about being addressed in such a way, but figured it&#39;d probably lose its weirdness over time. And she somewhat preferred it to hearing her actual name come out of his mouth as casually as it did with her peers. &quot;But you are bound at this point either way. Which can be very symbiotic, I believe, if not ultimately fruitless for you. I cannot speak for Luka, but the hyper nonsense will get old with me very quickly. Oh--before I forget. Axa, dear, his true name is <em>Szix Draanuk Algaz</em>. You&#39;ll remember that, won&#39;t you, darling?&quot; She added over her shoulder. 

Axa was mid-sip of hot chocolate, but paused as she was addressed, her pink eyes sliding over to the imp blandly--who seemed to wilt a fraction under her gaze. But then she looked away again, nodding a little and tucking back into the provided drink and attention. Now that they were settled and mostly focused on each other, Jaska would have an easy time spotting the black lines on her hands where she had torn her own skin open before her aunt and uncle had been able to intervene. Fortunately, it was very minor in comparison to some prior episodes of such behavior.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Luka disappeared off into the bathroom, and Jaska tipped his head to examine the scratches on Axa&#39;s hands.

“Too kind, too very kind. And gracious! Helpful man, master Luka. Szix takes any shape master Luka finds most good.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Though I would prefer if you simply call me Luka, and leave off the &#39;master&#39; honorific.&quot; He unwound the towel from around his hair, running his fingers through the vividly bright curls of damp hair, the wetness only saturating and enriching the colors.

&quot;I have a bit of time left, Val, I&#39;ll help you clean up the rest of this.&quot; Luka almost asked the imp if he&#39;d like to help, but considering he&#39;d be helping clean up the remains of his fellow imps... No, certainly not.

(Jaska would have put the bodies of the dead imps in a bag and taken them with him to give to Skena.)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Val glanced over with a soft smile as she was addressed. &quot;Ah, thank you. I just need to borrow your eyes, and prestidigitation should clean up all the stains. Though if there is any debris or gory bits lying around, those will need to be gathered by hand.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He gathered up some paper towels to clean up the chunky bits, directing Valentine with his gaze toward the areas that needed to be prestidigitized.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It didn&#39;t take terribly long--magic was infinitely faster than scrubbing stains out by hand--and after a bit of extra care taken to put things back that had been knocked from their intended homes in the chaos, Val brushed off her hands, giving Luka&#39;s shoulder a gentle bump with her own. 

&quot;Perfect. Thank you, dear, I think that&#39;s about everything. I&#39;ll get the door mended some other time, but that&#39;s not dire.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
