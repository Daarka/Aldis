Some had been curious - why target the small towns? Weren&#39;t they small fish? Sure, but people in small towns were also usually very <em>bored.</em> Particularly the young adults. And that would lead to some very loyal clientele.

So, while he was doing his drug lord thing, he had Axa spend the evening with Valentine. Luka visiting her the same night was an annoyance, but he supposed having a working pair of eyes around helped in the event Axa had one of her very quiet meltdowns.

After an attempt at a new art medium (finger paints) and some dinner, Luka had told Valentine he would like to take a walk around with Axa, maybe do some shopping before everything closed up. She was of course welcome to join if she wished, but either way, the late afternoon found Luka hand in hand with Axa, stepping inside of one of the shops that had caught his eye - a calligraphy set in the window with all sort of colors of inks, and quills with interchangeable nubs, and parchment and wax melts.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

After reminding Luka to use his ring to reach out to her if she was needed, she sent them on their way, and then... went about her business in a very <em>on-standby</em> way, not getting into anything she couldn&#39;t immediately drop if she had to go clean up a mess so that Jaska didn&#39;t have a reason to murder his brother.

Axa hadn&#39;t really known what to do with the finger-painting, seeing as almost all art she created was done through telekinetically using a utensil. And though she tried to telekinetically handle the paint, it... didn&#39;t go very well. Made quite a mess, though, before she had just wandered away from Luka mid-bonding moment as it had begun to stress her out. But there hadn&#39;t been a meltdown at least, and she seemed perfectly neutral and willing to go out on the walk with him. 

She was finicky about touch with anyone who wasn&#39;t Jaska, but she still liked having habits, it seemed. So as they walked, she had reached out to gently fist a tuft of one of his tail tips in the absence of more direct things, like holding hands.

As they pushed into the shop, the two were greeted with a pleasant aroma of incense, and looking around, Luka would find it to be a shop that seemed to cater to various spellcasting component needs, and also... seemed to have a lot of religious themes. There were symbols of various gods in the form of amulets or depicted on the surface of other products, and it gave the whole environment a very homey, but sacred feel to it. 

As the incense settled around them, Axa sneezed.

A tall man was behind the counter, seated on a stool and reading a book as they entered. He had silvery blonde hair and bright, blue eyes, with broad shoulders, and dressed in a semi-casual tabard over his tunic that was embroidered with gold lining. He looked up as the tiefling(s?) came in, smiling welcomingly. 

&quot;Good evening--and good evening to you, little one. Do let me know if I can be of assistance.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At the greeting from the shop keep, he returned the smile. &quot;Thank you very much. You have a lovely shop.&quot;

Turning to Axa, he eased down into a crouch to be more at eye level to her. &quot;Would you like to look around and see if there&#39;s anything you want?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
<div class=chatlog__message-group><div id=chatlog__message-container-957106177177706576 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=957106177177706576><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><img class=chatlog__avatar src="/icons/Daarka.png" alt=Avatar loading=lazy></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__header><span class=chatlog__author style=color:rgb(192,106,155) title=daarka data-user-id=164583493953650688>Daarka</span> <span class=chatlog__timestamp title="Friday, March 25, 2022 7:38 PM"><a href=#chatlog__message-container-957106177177706576>3/25/2022 7:38 PM</a></span></div><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Ah, thank you very much,&quot; the man responded politely.

Axa glanced once towards Luka as she was addressed, before slowly looking around. Almost hesitantly, she released his tail and began to wander off independently, her expression completely empty as she looked over everything.

It was impossible to say if she looked interested in any of the things she laid eyes on. She gave no indication one way or another, silently padding around the various displays with big, owlish eyes. About ten minutes of this passed, before she finally showed something beyond blank neutrality. 

Up on a counter, just a smidge above her eyelevel, was an ornate letter-opener. Except it had the appearance of a delicate, beautiful dagger, despite not having the sharpened edge of one. At a glance, though, that distinction wasn&#39;t entirely obvious. Axa came to a halt in front of it, staring for a few seconds, before slowly stretching up on her toes, reaching to carefully fix her pale little hand around the stand the item was affixed to and drag it towards her. 

It wasn&#39;t the only thing on the countertop, however. And she didn&#39;t seem to realize how wide the base of the stand displaying it was; as she pulled it, the edge of the base caught a small, silver bowl with blue gems embedded in the rim. When she pulled, the bowl was bumped forward, and slipped off the edge of the surface, its contents partially splashing the child as it fell. 

It had looked to just be water, and had no label or containment methods that would imply it was anything otherwise. But there was a faint sizzling sound as it splashed her arm and the side of her face and shoulder, and <em>immediately</em>, ugly black marks began to form as her flesh rapidly <em>burned</em>. She recoiled instantly in clear pain, a surprised scream escaping her.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But he&#39;d studied too much with Valentine to be ignorant of what it could possibly be, and why it would hurt Axa so much. And as soon as the pieces connected, they were dismissed. It didn&#39;t matter, his niece was in pain. He quickly yanked out a handkerchief to try to blot up any remaining holy water on her skin. &quot;Oh, sweetheart, I know it hurts, I know. Just hang on, you&#39;ll be alright.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The way her eyes blotted out like they had black ink poured over them that spread to the surrounding skin in vein-like tendrils, and the way a seam split vertically down from the center of her bottom lip, allowing the now-cleaved halves of her lower jaw to spread apart in a display of rows and rows of little pointed teeth that was nothing short of horrific. 

It wasn&#39;t just the pain of being burned. It was a visceral, reflexive reaction to having her very nature assaulted in one of the most direct ways possible; it had spiked her anxiety to nearly its very uppermost capacity in just an instant. 

Luka didn&#39;t have much time to process or react to this display and the unnaturally deep hissing and clicking sounds coming from the little girl--as there was still a third party present.

&quot;--What have you <em>brought in here?</em>&quot; The shopkeep exclaimed, his previously welcoming voice dropping into something gruff and deeply alarmed. The man had shoved himself to his feet, blindly thrusting a hand to some shelf under the counter he sat behind.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As Luka was turned towards Axa, there was the muffled clatter of something from the front counter, a quick shuffling of footsteps, and then the click of something mechanical. If Luka glanced back, he would find the shop keeper out from behind the counter, now standing about a dozen feet away--with a crossbow in hand.

Magic wove itself through his words and lashed out directly at the man&#39;s mind. It was probably the most Disappointed Dad use of Vicious Mockery ever cast.

The man flinched at the psychic damage that surged through his head, a thin trail of red blood trickling from his nose--but he didn&#39;t back down. With Luka having clearly made his choice about which side he was on, the shopkeep pulled the trigger.

The bolt hit home squarely in Luka&#39;s gut, and the man was immediately moving to reload his weapon. He didn&#39;t quite get the chance to, though. 

The hissing and other hellish noises hadn&#39;t ceased from Axa. And at the dull sound of the crossbow bolt sinking inches into Luka&#39;s abdomen, Axa snaked out from around him, her face split open into an almost alien display of hissing, chittering teeth. The bolt that the man had grabbed to load into the crossbow next suddenly slipped out from between his fingers, pulling back a few feet in front of him--and then <em>jolting</em> forward with almost imperceptible speed, piercing into his eye and clean through his skull. 

It was such a clean shot that the man stayed on his feet for a second or two, before gradually swaying to the side, and collapsing limply, where blood began to pool freely around the new holes in his head.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her mouth didn&#39;t move the way one would expect it to for speech, and... the voice that came out of her, while soft, was... wrong. Layered tones, all of which sounded to be almost squealing in pain... like souls of the damned all speaking in unison.

&quot;... <em>Don&#39;t banish me...</em>&quot;

Valentine&#39;s response was even more immediate.

<em>&#39;We&#39;re coming. Don&#39;t pull the bolt out. I&#39;ll have Skena meet us there. If you can, if a sign or something is available, make the shop look closed. Is Axa okay?&#39;</em>

She had been just welcoming Jaska in from his business elsewhere, catching up in a very casual <em>how was work</em> manner, despite the nature of said work. But at Luka&#39;s message, her demeanor shifted completely from that usual sunshine to something cold and hard. &quot;--Something happened. We need to go. They&#39;re at the magic supply store down the street.&quot; She reached out to fix her grip on her brother&#39;s arm, not waiting for his consent--because it sounded like time was of the essence, and outside of her Inn, Valentine still very much had the limitations of a blind person.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Auntie&#39;s on her way - and it sounds like Jaska too. Wait right here.&quot;

Luka went to the door and turned the open sign over to closed, turning the lock on the door just in case. <em>&#39;She&#39;s burned and scared, but the shopkeep didn&#39;t hurt her. The burn was an accident.&#39;</em>

At Valentine&#39;s, Jaska was not particularly pleased at having found out Luka and Axa were out on their own, but begrudgingly hadn&#39;t made much comment about it. At least, not until Valentine&#39;s demeanor shifted. He grabbed Valentine&#39;s arm with a snarl and whirled around to bolt from the inn, dragging her behind him if he had to and yanking her upright if she ever stumbled. &quot;Of <em>course</em> something happened! How could you let them go out together alone?!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Shoving his way inside and ignoring how Luka stumbled back with a pained grunt, he looked wildly around, taking in and dismissing the dead body and finally looking to Axa as he rushed over to her, releasing Valentine&#39;s arm. He fell to his knees in front of her. &quot;Let me see, child. How badly are you hurt?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Axa looked even more contrite as the rest of her family showed up, but... less scared as Jaska swooped in on her. Her gaze was on the floor, still like black voids where her eyes should be, but her jaw slowly began to fuse itself back together, piece by piece.

She still had Luka&#39;s coat draped over her shoulders. Gingerly, she shrugged it off on one side to give Jaska access to the arm that had been splashed. As her hellish mutations died down, it became easier to see the ugly spots of black--of her blood--in warped little areas of flesh, looking a little melted and resembling any other burn wound, had it not been for the color.

But despite the ugliness of their appearance, they seemed... relatively superficial. It had just been a splash of holy water, not a dousing. Nothing that would have made the burns carve deep into her tissues. And Luka had promptly dried off a great deal of it before it could sink in and cause even more damage.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Luka knew what Axa was. He couldn&#39;t not, he was educated enough, and any doubts would have been cast aside upon seeing Axa&#39;s meltdown. He glanced back over toward Valentine and Luka, and did a sharp double-take at the sight of the bolt in his gut. Drawing in a deep breath, he looked back to Axa. &quot;This was not a breach of the contract,&quot; he said lowly. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. We&#39;ll get you home, we just need to get this mess cleaned up before someone walks in and causes trouble.&quot;

As Valentine reached out for him, Luka shut the door again. &quot;I&#39;ll live,&quot; he wheezed out in a strained grunt. &quot;You said Skena&#39;s on her way?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I think we stay here until Skena has concluded healing everyone, so no one is walking onto the street covered in blood.&quot; 

Her words didn&#39;t have their usual sunshine, but... they were calm. Collected. Even-toned and methodical. Luka had seen his sister face down unspeakable horrors unflinchingly before, but... taking a murder in stride and immediately, calmly setting about covering up the crime was a new one. She also didn&#39;t seem the least bit confused about how this man had ended up dead.

No, Luka was the last one to know what Axa was.

&quot;How is she, Jaska?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

If it hadn&#39;t been marginally more comfortable (or at least less painful) to just stand very still and not move his torso in the slightest, he would have sat down and put his head in his hands. As it was, he just stood there, shaking with adrenaline, feeling very cold and shock-y.

I went to her immediately and blotted up what I could of the water, but the shopkeep saw and... freaked out. He was going to shoot Axa, and fired upon me when I wouldn&#39;t let him.

She was unflinching in the face of gods and eldritch horrors, but... less brazenly confident when standing in between her brothers through a moment like this.

And yet, things appeared... relatively... okay. At least for this moment, fleeting though it might prove to be. She nodded slowly. 

&quot;...

So he spoke instead on something he felt less likely to provoke Jaska&#39;s ire. &quot;I couldn&#39;t not protect her. She&#39;s family. It doesn&#39;t matter what she is.&quot;

And yet, somehow, perhaps predictably, those words did hit Jaska wrong. His sharp features twitched into a brief flicker of venom, which hid a very, very deeply rooted twinge of hurt. <em>So why did you never protect me?</em>

&quot;Hi, sweetheart,&quot; she greeted Axa softly, kneeling next to Jaska in front of her and reaching out to gently place her fingers on the damaged arm. It didn&#39;t take long to mend the burns, the light of her magic seeming to simply erase them from the surface of her skin. She kept the magic pouring into her a bit longer than looked necessary, just to ensure she had gotten everything, even injuries that might be unseen.

Axa was bad about making eye contact normally, but her gaze was rooted exclusively to the floor now, still looking like she had done something wrong. Skena didn&#39;t anticipate much conversation out of her, so as she concluded her healing, she gave her a brief look-over, and then nodded to Jaska. 

&quot;I&#39;m going to go help Luka. Why don&#39;t you look her over and make sure I didn&#39;t miss anything while I do that?&quot; She offered softly, despite being quite confident she had healed the girl sufficiently. It would give Jaska something to do instead of just sitting in his stress, and it had the added perk of letting him know that just because her attention was shifting to his brother, she could be brought right back to help Axa if necessary. 

Standing again, she briskly walked over to where Luka stood, looking over the bolt in his gut. &quot;Good that you didn&#39;t pull this out... the position of this is worrying. But I&#39;ll be able to heal you as I pull it out, so no matter what it punctured, you aren&#39;t in danger of bleeding out with me doing this, okay?&quot; She said, her voice a light, soft reprieve from the tension of the situation. &quot;Are you particularly attached to this shirt?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Luka was still bracing the area around the wound with one hand, and there was very little bleeding as a result. He was pale, with a shimmer of cold sweat on his skin from the shock, but he still managed to smile at Skena. &quot;It&#39;s just a shirt.

I promise, it&#39;ll be good for you,&quot; she murmured, casting <em>calm emotions</em> on him. It was magic she was very averse to using in most cases, but... this seemed like a fine example of an exception.

Like the effects of anxiety medication, Luka would feel a peaceful quiet wash over his mind. Skena had been correct in that the magic did not alter the nature of his thoughts or change his opinions on anything, but it allowed him to feel... above all those things, instead of be battered about in the midst of them.

That accomplished, Skena&#39;s deft hands made quick work of cutting a line in Luka&#39;s shirt with a small knife she produced from her person, the cut going from the hem of the shirt to the hole the bolt had made (without touching said bolt). This allowed her to pull the shirt up and away from the wound, which she rolled up a few inches above the bolt and instructed Luka to hold in place there. 

&quot;Unless I&#39;m horribly misjudging how you are about these things,&quot; she murmured, her tone still warm and pleasant, &quot;It&#39;s probably ideal for you to not watch what I&#39;m doing. Pick a spot on the far wall to stare at, and I want you to walk through your day to me while I work. Tell me what you had for breakfast, and all of the little mundane things you did after that, in chronological order.&quot;

She had nothing to preemptively numb the pain, so talkesthesia it was. It seemed so silly, but having someone focus even just the bare minimum on something else had a way of taking the edge off the pain and soothing the nerves.

She carefully, harmlessly probed at the tissue around the wound as he began talking, trying to discern if the bolt had an arrow-headed tip or not, so she knew if she was working with something barbed. But figuring that it likely did not, she gently grasped the external bolt once Luka was well into the story of his morning, giving a single, fluid pull outwards before he could have time to recoil.

Fortunately, she had been right, and the tip of the bolt had no horizontal protrusions that would catch the tissues on its way back out, allowing it to slip out with far less pain than if she had to rip it free. Almost before the tip had even left his body, she was flooding the area with healing magic, doing her best to negate the pain by rapidly washing it away again, before even the bleeding could fully begin in earnest.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He spoke of a relaxed morning having coffee and a strawberry and cream scone at the cafe before work, and stopping by the pet store to watch the kittens play in the window, and how they reminded him of Gummy with their oversized, bat-like ears and sleek little bodies and round tummies. He was in the middle of describing getting everything set up for his first client at work when the bolt came out, and his words hitched as his entire body jolted, the hand holding his torn shirt out of the way clenched tight and the other one curling into a fist as it darted up to his mouth and pressed tightly against his lips to choke back any noise he might make.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I know this is a few notches above even the discretion you are usually pledged to,&quot; she murmured warmly, giving the girl a smile. 

Skena had... deliberately not processed the whole murder aspect of all of this. And she would not start doing that now. Not until she was all the way back home and these very dangerous people wouldn&#39;t be able to see the crisis. No, to Valentine and Jaska&#39;s face, she was the picture of professionalism and not-my-business grace. She nodded back, though the gesture was lost to Val.

&quot;You don&#39;t need to worry about me,&quot; she reassured softly. Glancing over her shoulder, she added towards Jaska, &quot;If there are any prolonged complications with her, have Valentine reach out to me and I&#39;ll make myself available. But from all I can see, I think she&#39;ll be just fine,&quot; she added gently. 

Taking a deep breath, she looked back to give Luka a small smile. &quot;The magic will last about an hour. Don&#39;t panic if it ends and you feel like you&#39;re spiraling; you&#39;re not spiraling, you&#39;re just returning to a more... unmedicated state. Mindful breathing will help if the stress gets bad. As will a warm bath or some nice tea.&quot; She paused, before her tone softened even further. &quot;No one wants things like this to happen, but if you have to protect yourself and those you&#39;re looking after, it&#39;s much more preferable that you and Axa are alive right now.&quot;

She didn&#39;t know the details of what had transpired, so she couldn&#39;t reassure based on exact events. And she was well aware that going off about how <em>based on what she knew about Luka, she was confident he did nothing wrong here</em> was a terrible idea--because while that might be reassuring to Luka, she was acutely aware that Jaska was listening, and she wasn&#39;t interested in being the catalyst that got this poor, sweet man murdered. So all she could do for the time being was give him basic advice on easing the worst of the trauma.

&quot;You have Valentine reach out to me if you need me, too, okay?&quot; She gave his arm a soft touch, the look on her face welcoming him to need her even if it was just for emotional support, without potentially complicating things by illustrating how much she liked him in front of his brother.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Valentine walked with Luka back to her room in the inn, releasing his arm as they passed through the doorway, which was shut behind them. Val immediately made her way into the kitchen to put the kettle on.

&quot;Does lavender sound alright, dear?&quot; She asked gently.


Back in the shop, Axa still hadn&#39;t looked up from the floor, her eyes having gradually returned to normal until the only sign of an incident being where the black blood had gotten on her clothes. In the silence she sat in with Jaska, there came a very faint, &quot;... I&#39;m sorry.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;How... How angry do you think Jaska is with me?&quot;


Jaska looked back to Axa, feeling calmer now that they were alone in the shop. &quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; he said softly. &quot;We&#39;ll take care of it. I&#39;m not upset with you.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He sees you took an arrow meant for his daughter. And even he can&#39;t find true fault with that.&quot; There was more nuance to it than that, but...

She leaned back against the counter to wait for the water to boil, sighing again. &quot;... What did you see? Of Axa?&quot;


Axa still didn&#39;t look up, her tail held close against her leg. &quot;... H-- ... He said he... won&#39;t let anyone... banish me.&quot; 

It was a longer sentence than she usually managed, but the fact that she sorted it out only emphasized how important she thought it was to make that statement known. Because she wasn&#39;t sorry she had killed the shop keeper. She was sorry she had melted down in front of Luka, knowing <em>acutely</em> how scared Jaska was of him knowing what she was, for fear of him seeking to eliminate her. Her words weren&#39;t even in defense of Luka... they were feeble damage control for her own error, as she was <em>so sure</em> it would have been no one&#39;s fault but her own if this had resulted in Luka sending her back to Hell.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was pretty sure he&#39;d be freaking out otherwise. &quot;...I wish I hadn&#39;t been left in the dark as to what she was. I would have been far more careful about where I brought her. I understand why I was, but... That shopkeep would still be alive if I had been appraised as to her true nature.&quot;


Jaska&#39;s brows quirked up at that. His only response at first was a low hum as he absorbed what Axa told him. Eventually, he let on to where his thoughts had taken him. &quot;Perhaps getting to know you first helped shape his stance on the matter. Either way, he knows, now. And it seems he is invested in you remaining here on this plane.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I&#39;m sorry, Luka. If it had been up to me, you would have been informed.&quot; She was quiet for a moment.

&quot;Axa is a pureblooded devil. Jaska encountered her by complete chance when she ended up on this plane. He at first meant to banish her back to Hell, understanding that he was treading volatile ground by having her sort of... temporarily under his care, with as dangerous as she was. But when he spoke to her, offering to send her back to Hell--assuming that was what she would want--she reacted in a way that made it clear she most certainly did <em>not</em> want to go back. So he acquired her true name, and negotiated a contract with her, ensuring she could not do harm to him or those under his protection, and promising her his protection as well.&quot;

She sighed slowly. &quot;It was more pragmatic at first. But he... rapidly fell in love with her. By the time you met her, he was no longer just calling her his daughter as a cover story. He adored her. And she has gradually settled down from the feral, volatile fiend she had been that first night, though... clearly, there is a degree of that which may never truly be gone from her. But she is all of Jaska&#39;s world, and so I&#39;ve done everything I can to accommodate them both.&quot;

Her brows furrowed softly, eyes half lidded. &quot;... Jaska made it clear early on that he wanted you to know nothing of her true identity. He feared that if you knew she was an extremely dangerous fiend and not a normal, mortal tiefling child, you would seek to eradicate her. Banish her. You posed a threat to the only thing he truly cared about, in his mind, if you knew. When I tried to explain to him how out of character that would be for you, he pointed to you having sought to eradicate <em>him</em>.&quot; Her lips twisted slightly. 

&quot;... <em>I</em> know your perspective, Luka. I know that the second you realized he was not a fragment of your own psyche, but his own individual person, your entire perspective changed. But... I think that&#39;s been hard for Jaska to swallow. It&#39;s still too much of an open wound, despite how he holds himself. He&#39;s rejected the notion any time I tried to offer it to him. Perhaps it felt safer for him to paint you in a broad stroke than to risk allowing any part of himself to give any degree of trust to you.&quot; She shrugged a little.

&quot;... But for all the stress and trauma of this evening... perhaps it opened his eyes. He can&#39;t paint you in that broad stroke anymore; you&#39;ve proved that categorization incorrect tonight. It may force him to consider the nuance of it all. But... I&#39;m still terribly sorry, Luka. I&#39;m sorry I was party to you being kept in the dark. It&#39;s not what I wanted. He&#39;s just... been robbed of consent for so long. I owed him the discretion he wanted.&quot;


Axa fell silent again, potentially relaxing a little as Jaska remained calm and reassuring. Wordlessly, she shuffled forward until she could tilt her head to press her little horns against Jaska&#39;s leg.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Val nodded slowly. “No one could ever truly ask more of you than that. And you are doing better, and have been from that pivotal moment onwards.” 

She turned to take the kettle off the stove as it began to whine, setting about pouring a cup of tea. 

“It was nothing short of valiant, what you did tonight.” Picking up the ceramic mug, she moved over to set it down on the table beside him, her hands then drifting up until they found his shoulders, then his jaw, followed by her leaning forward to gently rest her forehead against his. 

“I’m deeply proud of you, sweet brother.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And that would happen on a razor’s edge, with it far too likely her neurodivergent demeanor would elicit intrigue, even suspicion. And all it would take would be one divination spell to figure out what she was… and it was all downhill from there.

Far more murders to cover up.

Val tipped her head slightly at Luka’s resigned silence. “It will not happen again,” she murmured simply. “This was our error for not making you sufficiently informed. No one wants a repeat of this, so it will not happen.” She sighed softly.

“How are you feeling, dear? Do you think it will be severe when Skena’s magic fades?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her calmness was likely more related to a professional compartmentalization and less an indication of her moral compass. For all I know, she was immediately in tears the moment she left the shop.&quot;

Val wasn&#39;t terribly far off. Skena just knew how to hold her crises until she was somewhere it was harmless to meltdown in. Kaleva was likely, at the moment, wondering if she actually <em>was</em> capable of keeping healthily distant from Jaska&#39;s less pristine dealings--and she was probably insisting she was in control and could stop any time she wanted to and then justifying why this was an okay time to have been involved.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He finished his tea and set down the cup, pulling out his pocket watch to glance at the time.

I would personally feel much better about your safety to have you melt down here with me than off alone by yourself.&quot;

Throughout this time, Cassiana had hobbled her way to the shop, and--perhaps to be expected--was about as emotionally disturbed by the murder as Valentine had been. Probably even less than that. A discussion was had, before, instead of beginning to harvest the poor man, she elected to help Jaska arrange things so that it would look to be a suicide. After all, with the crossbow bolt in his own head, and the crossbow in his hand... the pieces fell into place rather nicely. There would be no mystery of where the body went, and no one would be able to conclusively prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he had not taken his own life. Not after Axa&#39;s minimal spots of black blood were meticulously removed from the carpet; that left the shopkeep as the only blood spilled. 

Cass seemed to... almost be having fun. She was emotionally muted... all of the time, really. But despite that, she handled the whole thing like an engaging party game and less like covering up a murder. Perhaps a welcome reprieve from the stress, if nothing else. She certainly wasn&#39;t uppity enough for it to be abrasive. And her lack of strongly expressed emotions seemed... rather soothing to Axa. There was less to be overwhelmed by, less to try to understand. Her presence felt like soft white noise instead of a crowded city street.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Well. Never let it be said he didn&#39;t reward good behavior. He plucked a pearl and an owl feather from the shelves, thanked Cass for her assistance, and saw them all out of the shop - locking it when they left. From there it was a short walk back to Valentine&#39;s, and he let himself and Axa inside.

It was specifically crafted as a reagent for casting identify, because the pearl had been attached with delicate silver wire and wrapped around the stem of the feather. The feather in question was from a snowy owl, white in color with black dappling.

A quiet panic attack and some silent sobbing in the bathtub later, Luka eventually felt relaxed enough to get out, drying off and wrapping himself in a terrycloth robe. As he stepped out of the bathroom and caught sight of Jaska, he murmured softly, &quot;Oh... Welcome back. Did everything get taken care of?&quot;

&quot;Yes, we wound up leaving the body. Looked enough like a suicide to be believable. It was his own crossbow bolt in his head, after all, and the crossbow was in his hand. Axa&#39;s blood was cleaned up.&quot; Jaska looked over the owl feather once more, and then held it out to him.

Luka... was stunned silent at the feather held out to him, slowly approaching to take it in hand, noting the pearl wrapped around it. He drew in an uncertain breath. &quot;Is this... for me?&quot;

&quot;Well <em>I&#39;m</em> certainly not going to get any use of it,&quot; Jaska sneered.

There were some brief mental gymnastics done. Jaska had given him a gift. <em>Jaska had given him a gift.</em> But it was... very probably stolen from the shop they had just murdered the owner of. Which made him uncomfortable. But it was a gift. And a thoughtful one at that. And he was too desperate for the opportunity to look this gift horse in the mouth too closely. &quot;...Thank you,&quot; he whispered, blinking away tears.

&quot;Hnf. You took a bolt to the gut for my daughter, you might as well get <em>something</em> out of it.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But she wouldn&#39;t get ahead of herself too quickly. Nor did she want to draw excessive attention to Jaska&#39;s gesture, less it get him defensive and discourage him from ever doing something of that nature again.

&quot;Speaking of,&quot; Val interjected gently, &quot;How is she?&quot; 

Axa had promptly crawled up on the couch next to Jaska, tucking herself against his side. She had permission to wander away, but apparently little desire to, still a bit folded in on herself.

Axa slowly glanced over, not quite looking Luka in the face, but... still actually giving him her attention. She was silent a moment, and then, faintly, &quot;... I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Axa reflexively glanced once at Jaska--but this time, she managed to look back to Luka without needing reassurance, and after a moment, gave a tiny nod. Almost out of habit, she shifted her previously wounded arm forward where he could see; after all, when asked about her injuries, it was always someone who wanted access to them.

Which in and of itself was an interesting evolution for her. Vaguely amusing that she now expected any inquiry about her wounds to mean that person wanted to see them, but noteworthy more than that for her to reflexively trust a small collection now of different individuals to mess with her injuries. It spoke of some careful, but consistent trust, like a wild animal that held still for a human&#39;s hands, because the animal was trapped or hurt and somehow knew the human meant to help them, defying all instinct in the process.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

When Luka made hot chocolate, he made it right, melting chocolate with milk, sugar, vanilla, and salt over the stove. He poured himself and Axa a mug, bringing one over to her to pass it off and then moving to sit on the other end of the couch, sipping at it.

&quot;So, you are appraised as to what Axa is now,&quot; Jaska stated.

Luka blinked at Jaska, nodding. &quot;I am. I wish I&#39;d known earlier or I wouldn&#39;t have brought her there, but I understand why I was not.&quot; He looked down into his mug, a few damp curls falling down over his face. &quot;I will protect her with my life. I give you my word on that, Jaska.&quot;

Jaska side-eyed Luka, his tails twitching slightly. &quot;Good. If you prove yourself to be a more competent caretaker, I might have her stay with you occasionally during the situations I&#39;m unable to have her with me.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Perhaps almost suspiciously. 

But there were no floating globules of pus in it this time, so she lifted it to her lips for a tentative sip. Regardless of the temperature, even if the drink had been boiling, she seemed perfectly comfortable drinking it, and... seemed to gradually find it to her liking, relaxing back against Jaska to sip away.

Val, meanwhile, was doing her best to not ruin the moment, but still hadn&#39;t had any success wiping the little smile off her face. Jaska was... actually offering to let Luka watch her. In his own cagey way.

She didn&#39;t even have to have the ability to exchange a glance with Luka. It was unnecessary; she knew, intimately, how much he ached to be in that girl&#39;s life.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He stopped abruptly when Jaska lifted his hand to cut him off, sending him a sharp glare. &quot;Enough,&quot; he said curtly. &quot;I don&#39;t want to hear your apologies.&quot;

Luka froze, wilting slightly under the look. He opened his mouth to apologize, realized what he was about to do, and simply nodded instead. &quot;I&#39;ll do better. I promise. By you, and by her.&quot;

&quot;See that you do.&quot; Jaska finished off the rest of the scotch, setting aside the empty glass and patiently waiting for Axa to finish her drink.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>&#39;Don&#39;t be discouraged. He&#39;s being as open minded as he knows how to be. I think this is the beginning of things truly improving,&#39;</em> her voice murmured into Luka&#39;s mind.

Jaska would have a much more climactic exit if Axa knew he was waiting on her. Or could read the room in any capacity whatsoever. So she just slowly sipped away every few seconds. She had only gotten about a third of the way through it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Having finished his own hot chocolate, he rose back up - pausing to retrieve Jaska&#39;s empty glass - and went to go wash both in the sink. &quot;I&#39;m going to go get dressed and head home, then. And Jaska? Thank you again for the reagent. Do let me know if you need anything identified, I&#39;d be happy to help.&quot;

Jaska simply hummed in affirmation. Because that was, of course, part of the reason he gave it to Luka.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
