He may as well have, considering how often he was a customer... though his visits had been distinctly more staggered ever since Samhain. Still, he was too stubborn to give up his favorite drinking haunt.

Old boots thumped against the wooden floor, the muted jingle of jewelry &#39;round neck and wrists that he so proudly wore heralding his arrival. He&#39;d recently gotten a new shirt, and it still looked halfway decent; practically a miracle considering how used and worn the rest of his clothes were. The top of the shirt was scandalously open, only closed once it tucked under the scarves and belts around his waist.

He gave the barkeep a wave and a bark for a whiskey as he leaned up against the bar, looking around to gauge the other inhabitants.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And on the stage, a familiar yuan-ti malison danced, dressed in golden jewelry and drapes of silky purple fabric connected artfully to the jewelry he wore, covering so little that he was essentially nude (though that meant little when his lower body was serpentine).

His neatly braided cornrows sounded like a rattlesnake&#39;s warning as the beads woven in them clattered together, swung around him like a hundred tiny black serpents themselves. His arms were brought up with his swaying torso, the motions so liquid as to make it seem he had no bones at all.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That singular yellow eye followed Yarrow as he entered, the individual&#39;s disposition, body language, and expression providing virtually no clues as to what emotions (if any) they were experiencing.

He drank in the yuan-ti&#39;s performance just as hungrily as he did his drink, eyes pulled along for every undulating movement. His lips twitched into a grin.

Then he noticed Petra. The grin dropped immediately as their gaze met, that previously relaxed lounge against the bar stiffening. He stood up straight, one hand resting on the wood as his brow furrowed a moment... though they didn&#39;t seem keen on moving anytime soon. He took another gulp of his drink while he tried to gauge if there would be any changes.

Cautiously he moved from the bar to another table close to the performance, though with at least one table between him and her. The seat he&#39;d grabbed had kept her in his view, though he tried to yank his gaze back to Mahva&#39;s inviting dancing. To him, he offered another grin and wave. &quot;Hell yeah, get it!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The dance continued for a few more minutes before it ended, the red glow of the crystals fading to black, and then the normal tavern lighting reasserting itself to Mahva&#39;s stealthy exit backstage.

The tip jars set around the edge of the stage were collected by an employee to bring to his room, and Mahva took a couple of minutes to strip himself of his costume and don a silky purple kurta and a golden scarf before he made his way out, slithering between patrons and thanking them graciously at the compliments he was given. Gradually he made his way to Yarrow, reaching out to curl his fingers lightly along his vine-laden hair. &quot;And a good evening to you, Yarrow.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His cup rested against his chin, the top of the glass just below the eyes as though it were a makeshift shield to keep him safe from her intimidation. Oh, look how menacingly she sat there unmoving.

Mahva&#39;s return was a blessing, and he leaned into the touch, casting that grin his way once again. &quot;Hopefully a better one now that I&#39;m here?&quot; he teased, raising his drink as a sort of toast.

&quot;Did I miss the rest of the performance?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His gaze drifted to Petra, noting to himself that she was settled in comfortably, and decided to nudge aside a chair to settle in at Yarrow&#39;s table. Because being around them both in near quarters was bound to be interesting. He flagged down a waitress to order a glass of wine, but little else.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Mahva&#39;s answer earned a tut and an understanding nod. &quot;Ahh.. I&#39;ll just have to come earlier next time then. Or maybe warm you up another way... although perhaps a warmer fire down here would do the trick better.&quot;

Despite his casual flirtation, Petra&#39;s nearby presence continued to unsettle him just enough that it was noticeable, especially in such close quarters. His gaze flicked back to Petra again, still waiting for something that seemed to never come.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was a bit hard to ascertain at a distance, but that yellow eye&#39;s tiny pupil could be seen pointed in their direction if one looked carefully enough. Mahva&#39;s reappearance had their attention for a little bit, and as he looked their way, the gaze was reciprocated in a brief, wordless, expressionless exchange. But that was about the extent of their involvement for the moment.

She found it intriguing. It was unlikely Yarrow knew of her history with Mahva specifically, and though she was mostly out of earshot if they chose to lower their voices, she still couldn&#39;t help but wonder if Yarrow would presume Mahva more of his own ally and confide interesting things. Things she hoped Mahva would relay later. She still had... many unanswered questions of her own.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The crystals had his attention more than the dance did, admittedly, though that attention soon drifted as they dimmed and things went back to their usual coloration and lighting.

Now he was lingering for a bit of good old fashioned eavesdropping, feigning an interest in the stage itself as he peered at Mahva and Yarrow. He&#39;d seen Petra on his way in, though he had yet to make a habit of pestering insectoid bouncers - something that likely kept his pieces where they needed to be, given his nature.

&quot;Y&#39;mean those kinda services are offered here?&quot; he asked curiously as the yuan-ti and aasimar spoke, likely giving away his true reason for lingering. &quot;I figured a small town like this&#39;d be lackin&#39;.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He drew back with a heated look that conveyed knowledge of all the dirty things he knew the aasimar enjoyed, that gripping hand sliding around to more gently cup his jaw and run a thumb along his lower lip, trailing the sharp edge of a nail manicured into a pointed tip. Scandalous.

He settled back onto the coils of his tail, which unwound from Yarrow&#39;s chair to allow him to get the promised drinks, sliding his gaze to Candles. &quot;You are fortunate indeed.

Of those given to Yarrow were mild hesitancy--but more than that, a ragged and hollow feeling of a vacancy where one&#39;s tongue was meant to be. The ghost of a feeling of a flexing muscle that should have been able to create suction, but with said muscle gone. The feeling of thirst, of never quite being able to drink as deeply as preferred. Yet all presented as simple, objective thoughts, with no real accusation tacked on to them.

He grinned into the kiss, pressing back greedily at the reward. The yuan-ti got a heated look in return, his already questionable self control dwindling further on not spending all his money on another night with him. He had no shame, leaning into the touch as though he were starved of it.

It was only the touch of Petra&#39;s mind that pulled him from it, straightening once again to look back to them. He shuffled uncomfortably under the feelings as they were parsed to him.

And it was uncertain again; a lingering, almost wary question of if Yarrow even remembered. If he had to ask because he had no memory of it--and with that curiosity, there was a subtle hint of the memory itself, an involuntary attachment to the query. Searing pain as blade cleaved through tongue, the overwhelming taste of blood until nothing could be tasted at all anymore, quickly devolving into a feeling of choking and nearly drowning in one&#39;s own blood... all a faint echo in the back of her hollow communication where words should have been. 

Oddly, still no proper accusation. As if she wasn&#39;t sure how much that man had in common with the one she was looking at.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A clatter of coin on the bar and a refil later, he finally had all drinks in hand and enough in him to turn around and deliver the goods.

A glass of water clinked beside Petra, Yarrow&#39;s jaw set despite the twitch of his cheek hinting the words roiling inside him. He cleared his throat before murmuring just for her ear. &quot;I thought you were dead.&quot;

Like retreating from a hot stove, he straightened back up to move back over to his previous table with far more pleasant company, drinks still in his arms. &quot;Here we are~&quot; he said cheery, attempting to salvage some semblance of his good evening.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But he walked away promptly, removing himself from a continued discussion. 

Petra could have forced it. She could have kept pushing herself into his mind. But... she didn&#39;t seem that aggressive as a person. So it left her sitting in silence, staring after him with an unchanging expression that was thoroughly unreadable. 

When she next reached out telepathically, it was not to Yarrow, but to Mahva. Even more of that quiet uncertainty. A somewhat unsettled discomfort, an expectation that determining where Yarrow presently stood in relation to who she had encountered before would be fairly straightforward. And the reality, the ambiguous words and gestures, being anything but. While she seemed to struggle to relay exact words, her immediate memory of what Yarrow had quietly spoken to her seemed to convey her receiving it as... resentful. Bitter. 

The emotions were all so hesitant, so unsure... but she seemed to be leaning more on the side of interpreting Yarrow to be unapologetic of his actions rather than someone seeking atonement for them. Or even just... carrying shame. 

That quiet, privately optimistic demeanor she often had was struggling with this. Almost like there was a sense she had expected, even hoped, that he would be remorseful. Floundering somewhat in the stark lack of any such indication.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, November 23, 2022 5:14 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At the question he gave a lackadaisical shrug and a dramatic sigh. &quot;Been on some training missions, but not the big real ones really. I know how to defend myself, but there&#39;s a difference between getting mugged in an alley and hunting down big ol beasties. Apparently the last gig was a whole thing about a mimic?

The conversation at the table continued for a while longer as Petra just stayed put, processing. Thinking. Not touching the drink Yarrow had delivered her.

Whatever all of <em>this</em> is-&quot; he gestured to most of Petra and their additions &quot;is beyond anything I know. I don&#39;t care what you do, as long as you do it far away from me, okay? Is that good enough?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Like it was just that dismissive. 

There still... didn&#39;t seem to be palpable offense or aggression in those emotions as they currently stood. But what Yarrow shied away from and was afraid to confront, Petra seemed to seek a full autopsy on, no detail feeling sore to her in the thoughts she shared. 

Which was strange, considering she should have been infinitely <em>more</em> traumatized than him.

Her thoughts then seemed to alter course. Her initial question, ambiguous though it was to convey, wasn&#39;t getting an answer that made things make sense to her. So instead came a new curiosity: one that wondered at what Yarrow had gained from it all. The collection of separate things taken, the act itself that took everything else. She presented the notion like a transaction, formulaic and methodical--and missing the details of what had been transferred in exchange.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I&#39;m from Siscia. I was out on the coast once on a cruise when our boat was captured by pirates of the Siren&#39;s Song. <em>Cultists.</em>&quot; The word tasted bitter on his tongue to admit. &quot;I was useful, so they kept me around and put me to work. I prepared sacrifices for The Lady; in return we were graced with calm seas and strong winds always in our favor. We were the richest pirates on the coast..&quot;

The memories of the good times flooded his mind for a few moments, the corner of his lips twitching into a smile. Mere moments later those memories were followed by the work required to keep said favor. His smile faltered, and his fingers twitched until he scratched an arm. &quot;It&#39;s.. she&#39;s hard to quit. She always wanted more, and her wrath is... Terrifying.&quot;

He finally looked back to Petra. &quot;You were just a slave sold to us for something. I don&#39;t remember what for, but you went to The Lady just like everyone else.&quot;

A pause, memory stirring again. &quot;Yuan-ti slaves.. I think we got a lot of sacrifices from them.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

When she did finally offer a response, it was a curious combination of thoughts. First, the torturous sensation of water filling lungs that burned in search of oxygen, that suffocation only worsening until blackness took over, with the weight of leagues of ocean water pressurizing down into one&#39;s bones as if it would crush them entirely. With that memory--though it was conveyed indirectly, and not simulated in perfect replica to Yarrow, fortunately for him--came the conclusive notion that Yarrow&#39;s prior assumption had been correct. There was no miraculous rescue for a bound and mutilated person thrown into the ocean. The inevitable end was death.

And then the simpler notion, concise enough to almost equate to proper words. Yarrow&#39;s <em>Lady</em> had spit her back out.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Yarrow would receive her thoughtful feelings, a hesitation to agree simply because...

Sparing a life seemed <em>quite</em> indicative of favor. 

But acknowledgement that Petra was unfamiliar with this <em>Siren</em> entity. No memories of visions of such a creature, or encountering anything at all in that crushing, breathless blackness. Only death, and then... air again. Sand below, sun above. 

With those thoughts came a physical bit of communication as well, as some of the ragged frills along her neck flexed and flared--revealing gill slits beneath her jaw. Features that would have prevented a drowning, had they been present at the time.

Those thoughts continued on, musing over a different vein of the arcane that could be felt flowing within herself than had existed prior to the watery grave. It was ambiguous and imprecise to convey, but... she seemed to &quot;speak&quot; of changes of many kinds. Not coming back the same as she had been snuffed out.

Only getting one side of the very juicy conversation.

Petra finally blinked that eye, just once. Her response contained fresh memories; not of the ocean or the sensations of dying, but some time before that. Memories with vision. An existence capable of speech. A feeling of thriving, of being around likeminded individuals. A desire for perfection, the mentality of being engrossed in the sciences of biology. Finding that sought perfection in some arthropods, and the societal norms surrounding her resulting in the conclusion that so she, too, must evolve. 

The tail and the mandibles had certainly been there when they had first crossed paths. Perhaps the second set of arms, as well--but that was uncertain, given that she had never been released from her bindings enough to let such extremities loose. 

But then the memory of sand and sun again. There was no vision then, a feeling of barely even knowing for certain she was not dead, with two of her bodily senses ripped away. So blindness, for a time. Muteness, seemingly permanently. But a nod towards old habits dying hard; pursuit of further evolution came sooner or later, once more drastically warping her own anatomy to sprout a replacement eye, freeing her of one of the imposed handicaps. Though even that vague memory seemed seeped in tedium and adversity. Needing things--materials? Ingredients?--but being unable to see enough to acquire them directly. Being unable to speak enough to request them from others. Results only birthed from arduous but unwavering persistence. Development of arcane telepathy, no small feat of its own, as she gradually undid the effects of the damage inflicted, seemingly singlehandedly accommodating her own new disabilities despite said disabilities making doing so a Sisyphean task. 

No, The Lady was not responsible for every alien feature of the hybrid. Much of it... was just Petra. Organic Petra (&quot;organic&quot; used in the loosest sense of the word). 

And yet, that feeling remained. She had things now that she did not before. Things she did not cultivate herself, despite all of her other assets seemingly having been deliberately hand-crafted for herself, by herself. Something lingered.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Into his mind next came the shapeless, ambiguous presence of her “voice”. To him, she gave ideas of the feeling of needles pressed deep into flesh, until they scraped skull bone. Blood streaming down the center of one’s face as a sharp instrument sliced long and deep down the center of the forehead, deep enough to scrape bone again. The <em>splitting</em> migraine as something beyond metal utensils—something warped and arcane—split that bone, too. And then just… kept splitting. The surgical precision made unspeakably harder due to the surgeon simultaneously being the un-anesthetized patient. Like threading the finest of needles, brain matter itself being ever so delicately repositioned, creating just enough space for something new to take root. The sickening feeling of weeks, maybe even months, spent with an unending migraine as the body adjusted, shuddering with the struggle to not just heal, but to reroute it’s very genetic code. A person may pierce their ears, prompting their body to heal the pierced wound with the new feature remaining—but this was different. This was not body modification. This was <em>evolution</em>, this was teaching one’s body to not just adjust to changes, but <em>become</em> the changes.

This conveyed, Petra succinctly dropped the connection with Candles to resume it with Yarrow, looking back to him. The message to him was far simpler: a sense, somewhat amorphous though it was, that it was not the way of things to put back what was destroyed. A sense that things that could be destroyed did not prove themselves worthy of persisting. Communication orally was convenient—and yet, a surgeon’s blade was all it took to permanently disable it. But this… this could not be so easily silenced. And in time… perhaps it could grow. Strengthen. Do all that oral speech could. Do <em>more</em>. <em>That</em> was the way of things.

Then she leaned in a tiny fraction, a faint tilt towards the aasimar. There next arose the question regarding his label of her, the <em>importance</em> he referenced. What was it he had said… smooth sailing? Tranquil seas? She seemed to wonder if these things were what he saw so important as to be worth more than lives. And yet… there was no seething altruism to those thoughts.

No, it was earnest curiosity. Very nearly childlike wonder. 

An afterthought of sorts was tacked on; the notion of magics used to control bodies of water. The relative simplicity of those magics, how such spellcasters capable of them were hardly rare. The comparison of how common willing spellcasters would be to the much harder to come by <em>sources of human sacrifice</em>.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, November 26, 2022 12:41 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Efficiency that came with her current method of communication, even as unrefined as it currently was.

The pressed lips turned to a frown at her furthering questions into the <em>point</em> of it all. Sure, they were reasonable inquiries; if that was all it was, it <em>was</em> overkill to sacrifice people for the sea&#39;s favor.

&quot;... Well if you remember, I <em>did</em> say it was a cult. There was this.. religious aspect to it. This hadn&#39;t exactly been a  new thing from what I understand... But also, people can run out of spells to make the winds and seas all nice. Fail them, sometimes. The Lady could not.&quot;

It was a voice none of them were familiar with. Looking to its source, the men (and Arthropoda-appropriating abomination) would find a petite young woman had crept up towards their table. She was fair-skinned, with medium-long brunette hair and--strangely, peach-pink eyes, like the color of rose quartz. In fact, she would have looked entirely and thoroughly human if not for that detail, as well as the much more immediately noticed detail of bearing the large, brown-furred ears of a fox atop her head. And not as decoration; they were trained on those speaking, shifting minutely to ensure they caught every word.

She was in simple but cozy-looking common wear of a tunic and trousers, with a teal cape draped around her shoulders, looking rather like traveling gear. And her attention was fixed on Yarrow with what could only be described as childlike wonder in her strangely colored eyes.

I like going out to see the world, so it’s cool I can get paid to do stuff that I’d… mostly be doing anyways. Though Holbrook is pretty nasty right now, even this early into winter.

And sure enough, now that she was closer, he would also be able to spot the little pale hairs scattered about her hair and subtly dusted through the fur on her ears.
