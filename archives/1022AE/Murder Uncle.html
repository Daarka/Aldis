In some ways this was preferable, the aasimar tended to prefer his own company and rarely had any sort of urge to socialize. On the other hand, visitors meant the possibility of meat. He&#39;d grown very adept at harvesting, smoking, and drying meat. He actually had a few caches scattered over the desert where he&#39;d hide a small supply in the event he was having poor luck hunting. But his nearest cache was a roughly thirty mile trek yet, and he ran out yesterday.

That&#39;s why it was such a fortunate turn of events that the halfling woman had approached his camp, sunburned and parched for water and begging for help. Achoris sat across from the little oil lamp set between them, its golden glow cast over them both, watching as &#39;Dinah&#39; took sips from his water pouch, her raw skin shiny with the soothing aloe he&#39;d offered to her.

&quot;What are you doing out here anyway? Surely you realize how ill-equipped you are to survive in a place like this.&quot;

Dinah winced. &quot;I&#39;m trying to get to Cautica, but I got caught in a sand storm and lost my compass. I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be out here for this long. You&#39;re the first bit of luck I&#39;ve come across since I set foot in this stupid desert.&quot;

Achoris&#39; lips spread into a slow, languid smile. <em>You&#39;ll be rethinking that before morning.</em> &quot;Cautica, hmm? What&#39;s so important that you&#39;re traveling there for, without so much as an escort or a mount?&quot;

&quot;Oh - I&#39;m on a quest!&quot; She perked up at that, quite proudly, and Achoris was struck with the feeling of youth and naivete. &quot;See, I&#39;m trying to gather information about this aasimar of Anubis, they&#39;re offering a lot of coin-- oh?&quot; Dinah blinked as Achoris&#39; demeanor abruptly shifted, from relaxed and amused to alert and interested. &quot;Have you heard of her, maybe?&quot;

&quot;I may have heard a thing or two,&quot; Achoris mused, sitting up a bit straighter, his smile growing. &quot;What sort of information are you looking for?&quot;

&quot;Whatever I can get, really. Cautica&#39;s the main place to find the various temples to the Cusai gods. I figure the temple of Anubis might be my best bet. Apparently she was some figure of importance, so it&#39;s my job to find out what happened.&quot;

Achoris arched a dark brow, letting out a low hum. &quot;I see. Well, that&#39;s certainly the correct place to start looking. Who is it that wants to know so much about her anyway?&quot;

The halfling shrugged. &quot;Not sure, the job is being handled through an intermediary. Usually how these things go. Privacy and secrecy and all that.&quot;

<em>Secrecy indeed.</em> &quot;Understandable.&quot; He reached for the was-scepter at his side, planting the end into the sand and pushing himself to his feet, tilting his head at the curiously naive gaze of the woman across from him. &quot;Well... This is a bit of a pickle. I was just going to kill you and eat you, but now I may have to potentially keep you alive for further interrogation... And I&#39;m <em>really</em> quite hungry.&quot; Her eyes went wide with dawning terror as Achoris&#39; form became shrouded in shadowy tendrils, and she let out a scream as he rushed at her.

...

Reaching into his pocket, Achoris took out the sending stone he&#39;d received from Altaira, running his thumb over it as he activated the magic, his vanta black eyes gazing at the bound and trussed body of the halfling he had knocked unconscious and stripped of her possessions. <em>&#39;Altaira, it&#39;s Achoris. Would you be so kind as to reach out and have Skena contact me at her earliest availability? The sooner the better.&#39;</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Altaira had twenty-four more words to converse with, but she was a spartan woman of efficiency, and so the singular word was all that came back to Achoris.

Five, maybe ten minutes would pass in the desert, before a new, more familiar voice reached his mind. 

<em>&#39;Achoris? Is everything alright? I--I can probably travel out if something requires it...&#39;</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Kaleva dismounted from Atreyu and went about removing his tack and bridle so they could set up camp beneath the overhanging rock. &quot;We still have some daylight.

Skena settled in beside Achoris as Kaleva headed off, watching the puppy amusedly. &quot;He does, doesn&#39;t he? A few more months and I believe he&#39;ll be fully grown, but he&#39;s almost there.&quot; She smiled softly, watching Atreyu splash around.

&quot;It was all very, very worth it. Kaleva is absolutely in love with him.

And she hadn&#39;t had actual family before. Not the kind you shared blood with. Achoris was unique, and not exactly politically correct in his lifestyle and choices, but... of all the people she could just happen to share blood with, she was actually quite content with it being him.

&quot;Yes, recent concerns aside,&quot; she murmured, glancing towards the dome, whose exterior was a simple, opaque, matte golden color that easily camouflaged with the sand. &quot;I think this solution should remedy that concern, too.

Achoris blinked at them, and tried again, his voice quivering with suppressed laughter. &quot;Regarding trying to find the person looking into you, can you think of any occasions where you can recall saying something in public you shouldn&#39;t have, or anyone who might have shown too much interest in you?

Skena was greatly amused by the animals, but the more sober nature of Achoris’ question reined in her attention somewhat. “… Saying something in public, yes,” she admitted after a pause, the look on her face clearly one of kicking herself. “A friend had gotten me talking about magic, and… he was deeply fascinated and impressed with some of the things I could do. Was really trying to encourage me to seek some sort of accolades for my work, and I found myself backpedaling and trying to explain to him that I didn’t want to be on a pedestal again. I… I didn’t say much specific, I don’t think, but… I shut up when I realized someone else had overheard and come to join the conversation. And I left at that point.” She shook her head a little.

“But… neither of those two seem the sort to do something like this. Definitely not the boy I was first talking to. Maybe… maybe Kaskra? Who came over second? I don’t know anything about him… a lizardfolk who’s incapable of speaking, but seems friendly enough. Maybe a little quirky, but he doesn’t strike me as sinister. But… I think… either it was him, or someone else overheard?” She winced, shaking her head. “But I don’t remember who else might have been in the tavern. And I can’t think of anyone in town who would want dirt on me.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Atreyu stood there with the branch in his mouth, heartbroken that the mare would not want to play with him. Kaleva was gone, and Gummy out of sight, so he turned instead to Skena and Achoris, trotting over and dropping into a play bow, skinny butt to the sky with tail waving high, growling as he displayed the branch to them.

Then Atreyu braced his paws and swung the branch, launching Achoris right toward the water.

Achoris was similarly worn out, but still conscious for the time being, having assembled a fire just as the sun was starting to set and the temperature was starting to drop.

Kaleva&#39;s hunt seemed to have proven successful. Two jackrabbits dangled from one hand, and he grabbed a rolled up piece of leather from Atreyu&#39;s pack, settling down next to Skena and spreading out the leather that he could have a surface to clean his kills that didn&#39;t get them full of sand. &quot;Everyone settled in okay?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He didn&#39;t really want to ask Skena to see if Anubis could find out whether or not Set loved him with Kaleva in earshot. That was a bit too personal.

Kaleva didn&#39;t miss the hesitation, but figured the reason why easily enough. After his rabbit was cleaned, he went to fetch some butcher paper from his pack so he could start wrapping up the meat. &quot;What&#39;s the difference between demons and devils anyway?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At Kaleva’s question, she looked over, nudging her butcher work towards him to wrap. “Devils are lawful, demons are chaotic. Devils seek domination, whereas demons seek blatant destruction. Devils occupy Hell, demons occupy the Abyss. There is a perfectly mirrored situation with celestials, too; archons are lawful, eladrin are chaotic.

Most celestials that encounter mortals are said to be quite humanoid in appearance, though often with feathered wings. But there have been historical records of encounters with extremely powerful, high ranking celestials, whose appearances aren’t humanoid at all. Interwoven rings like burning wheels, tangles of half a dozen pairs of wings… it’s in those stories where things are described like bodies covered in eyes. In truth,” she mused, “I would hazard to guess that powerful celestials look more terrifying to the average mortal than their infernal counterparts. After all, devils flourish when one welcomes them in without a fight, so it’s in their best interest to look like a person of some sort. Celestials… perhaps with the exception of those who act as messengers of the heavens… they don’t really have such a need. More often than not, the first thing a celestial will say to a mortal upon encountering them is <em>be not afraid</em>. It certainly implies that they are something fearful to behold.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>
