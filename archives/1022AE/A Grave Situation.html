He&#39;d decided to head out foraging on his three-day weekend, get out and away from town for a bit. The plants he was growing for Jaska were coming along effortlessly and would continue to thrive untended for a bit. And his bag already had a large number of finds packed and tucked away. Mint and basil in abundance, chanterelle, chicken of the woods, and chaga mushrooms, a beautiful chunk of blue lace agate, and assorted bones.

But some soft earth on a steep incline had taken him for a tumble when his bad leg abruptly buckled, and he was sent top over teakettle, down and down and down, until he tumbled into a ravine.

He had been unconscious for... a length of time he wasn&#39;t entirely certain of, but when he came back to consciousness, he felt like one great exclamation point of pain. One of his arms was broken, at least. He wasn&#39;t sure what else. His antlers had become caught in some tangled roots and had brought him to a rough stop, his neck and back on fire from the abrupt yank it had caused.

How many times had he seen deer skulls with the antlers caught in various locations that had clearly told the grim story of the animal getting stuck until they starved and died? 

He reached up with a shaking hand and started trying to work at the stiff roots holding his antlers hostage, but he could barely focus through the pain, panting for breath and trying not to make the soft, wounded noises his body wanted to make. The last thing he needed was to attract a predator.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But a scavenger, he did.

After a few moments of his struggling, he would find he was no longer alone. The flutter of large, heavy wings that had no need for a quiet approach were heard, followed shortly by the shuffling of a sizeable bird landing nearby. It did not attack, did not even really encroach on Hiraeth&#39;s space, but the large, dark-feathered vulture with unsettlingly bright red eyes stood effortlessly on the incline, watching him in his predicament. 

It was a bit ominous to have a vulture land beside you in your time of need, but at least it wasn&#39;t messing with him for the moment.</span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/948448015541239818/948454899224543232/young-bearded-vulture-gypaetus-barbatus-also-known-as-lammergeier-ossifrage-sitting-ground-182276055.png?ex=655d9475&amp;is=654b1f75&amp;hm=1d50abb2a3d13b988e90a46f6e3507dbce367cacd9be9b7e7860b74b53513ca8&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/948448015541239818/948454899224543232/young-bearded-vulture-gypaetus-barbatus-also-known-as-lammergeier-ossifrage-sitting-ground-182276055.png?ex=655d9475&amp;is=654b1f75&amp;hm=1d50abb2a3d13b988e90a46f6e3507dbce367cacd9be9b7e7860b74b53513ca8&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: young-bearded-vulture-gypaetus-barbatus-also-known-as-lammergeier-ossifrage-sitting-ground-182276055.png (892.39 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

I&#39;m not dead yet.&quot;

Could that work, though...? He could possibly ask the bird if it could bring help to him, but how would the bird even convey that if it was willing? And if it wanted to eat him, why would it bother denying itself a meal?

He really had nothing to lose by trying, and tried to gather his scattered wits through the pain to cast the spell necessary to communicate with it. <em>&quot;I understand you are probably hungry. But if you wait for me to die here, it may take days, or not happen at all if I free myself.

&quot;And where are you off to this time, Ven?&quot; Came the low, even-toned voice of some unseen woman, sounding perfectly calm. That tone didn&#39;t change as the shuffling steps drew nearer, and there was a pause, before she added. &quot;Ah. I see. You are a very premature creature, Ven. This is the second time now, and it does you no good.&quot;

Maybe she just didn&#39;t see how much of a problem the tiefling was grappling with, but she sounded very unbothered about the whole affair, though she did finally address him after chiding the vulture lazily. &quot;Good evening to you, stranger. Are you alright down there?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His voice wavered from the amount of pain he was in, but the fact he wasn&#39;t screaming and even attempting humor betrayed how accustomed he was to being in extreme levels of pain.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I can certainly <em>attempt</em> to be of assistance,&quot; she responded, still sounding remarkably unconcerned, but at least earnest. 

The vulture had looked over at the woman&#39;s arrival, and chose this moment to let out a high whistling call in her direction. Look, he did it. He got help. Good boy.

&quot;Be quiet, you bloody nuisance.&quot; There weren&#39;t immediately sounds of help on its way, as his savior had to figure out... what to even do. It wouldn&#39;t help anyone if she just ended up stranded down there with him.

He would have to wait a few moments more, before there was a soft <em>plap</em> of a rope unfurling to land near him. Shortly after came a creeping sort of smoke into Hiraeth&#39;s periphery, which drew towards him and seemed to congeal around his broken arm. As it sank into his skin, the pain gradually began to ebb, bones shifting back where they belonged. It was a slow process, but at least it was one that gradually reduced his pain. 

&quot;As soon as you feel able,&quot; came the woman&#39;s voice again in that almost sleepy drawl, &quot;begin to free yourself, while your blood is still up and the magic has numbed the worst of the pain. If you dally, you may lose that sweet spot of suppressed pain. Once you are up here, I can heal you properly.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her words, her warning, jolted him into action and he reached up with both hands to twist his head and pull at roots and work himself free. He finally had to basically pull himself into a pull-up, then wrench his head sideways, and once freed released the roots, he let out a sharp gasp as he started sliding again, quickly reaching out for the rope. He clutched it to his chest, panting heavily, and then grit his teeth and started to pull himself up.

What came over the edge of the ravine was a very sorry-looking tiefling with lichen-green hair that was tangled and splattered with mud and even caught up in the antlers that had given him such trouble. His tattoos were almost obscured underneath the dirt smudged all over his ash-gray skin, and he hadn&#39;t bothered with the cantrip to re-light his tail, so it was just a long, sinuous, rat-like extension of his body.

The moment he managed to heft his body the rest of the way over the lip, he turned onto his back and let out a shaken groan. &quot;Thank you...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But as he came over the crest of the ground, a narrow hand grabbed a fistful of his shirt and offered some assistance in pulling him the rest of the way, though he would be able to tell even from that simple contact that there was no real strength in this individual&#39;s physicality. 

The woman he was finally able to see was a gaunt and pale creature, average in height, but willowy and fragile looking. She had medium-long hair in a dusty brunette color, with the entire left side of her scalp bare and gnarled in scar tissue. Long elven ears ended in darkened tips, almost like her extremities were dusted in soot or charcoal. She had pale, glassy eyes of an almost grey shade of light blue, which--at a glance--almost looked to be clouded over like those of a corpse. 

She leaned on a long staff she held with a sort of weight distribution that implied it was contributing to her being able to stand at all, and not merely a hiking stick. She was bundled up comfortably in wool wraps and a dusty, off-black dress--and her left arm was almost completely missing. In its place, like a ghostly imitation of what should have been there, was the ethereal <em>shape</em> of an arm and hand, but comprised entirely of shaped smoke.

As Hiraeth returned to safety, she carefully eased herself onto the ground beside him, reaching forward to place that ghostly, nonexistent hand on the center of his chest. &quot;It is no trouble,&quot; she murmured as the smoke that created the shape of a hand billowed out from the confines of that silhouette, spreading from her like a continuous flow that silently and weightlessly spilled over his body. With it came more of that release of pain, until he very nearly felt back to neutral.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Gradually the sensation of being burned alive faded back to the usual ache as his abused nerves calmed themselves and his body healed the rest of the way.

When she&#39;d finished, he pushed himself back up into a sitting position, reaching up to brush his hair out of his face. &quot;I&#39;m very lucky you and your friend were around... I can truly say it&#39;s a pleasure to meet you.

Even with his faulty vision, it would be clear to see that there was some struggle involved in her getting to her feet again. Frankly, it didn&#39;t look too dissimilar from the struggle Hiraeth was personally familiar with; her left leg seemed rather useless to her, held out of the way more than it was actually used to leverage her weight. That was left to her right leg, and her intact arm braced on the staff of her own. But she made it upright again with the patience of someone well accustomed to their body&#39;s limitations, and she began poking around the area. Even her blurry shape made it clear she moved with a stiff limp, too.

&quot;Ah. You&#39;re in luck.&quot; A pause. &quot;Well, you aren&#39;t. Such is how we arrived in this situation. But your things do not appear to have fallen nearly as far as they could have. Mm... except for your glasses... I believe I see those, though...&quot;

It would be a little hard for Hiraeth to make visual sense of without his glasses, but her smoky hand appeared to detach itself from the stump of her upper arm, soundlessly floating forward away from her body and down into the pit Hiraeth had been pulled from. A bit of waiting, and a bit of stiff bending and careful positioning from Cass, and one by one, his things were retrieved. They were brought over to him individually, however, as the spectral hand seemed to struggle with the weight of the messenger bag by itself, and the woman needed her intact hand on her own staff. 

But one at a time, his glasses, then his staff, then his bag were returned to him, and Cassiana limped unhurriedly back his way. &quot;Everything as you remember it?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He took his glasses in hand, bending the wire frames back into the appropriate shape and using the cleanest bit of tunic he could manage to wipe the glass clean. They were cracked in one lens, but once he found someone with a mending spell they&#39;d be fine. Placing them upon his nose, he checked over everything else.

The staff was fine, though the sprig of mistletoe was looking a bit sad and was missing most of the white berries and several leaves. The bag had a latch, thankfully, and the contents seemed more or less intact, though... He let out a little laugh. &quot;Mostly. The chunk of agate I found pulverized my mushrooms, but I remember where I harvested them. I can gather more on my way back to town.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Trailing off, he murmured an incantation in druidic, a bit of subtle magic about him as he cast a spell, and then stood for a moment, listening to the woods around him. He moved his staff, pointing to the east. &quot;Grouse, about half a mile in that direction. Give me an hour or two, I&#39;ll see how many I can catch.&quot; 

And then, in a flash of smoke and fire, the tiefling had been replaced by a silver lynx. A hind leg was clearly scarred and twisted, and he set off at a hobbled gait on those large, silent murder mittens, bob tail flicking up behind him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Taking one of the grouse in hand, he began the process of plucking it, the other kept close enough to shield it from the vulture in case he tried to snatch it away. &quot;So where are you from, Cassiana?

I am a healer, but only because I am fluent in the language of decay--fluent enough to... reverse-engineer it, so to speak. But in more practical terms... I believe I have a knack for creating various remedies through herbs. And sometimes less savory ingredients.

Placing the lid on the pot, he set it next to the fire to start cooking.

&quot;It was one of the concepts I found perplexing myself the further south I went. When you live off the land and do not wish to waste anything, you start seeing your own body for what it is - a vessel of flesh and bone. It would make sense for your body to sustain something else after you leave it. Nourish the animals, nourish the earth.&quot;

He shrugged, wiping off his hands. &quot;In any case... Remedies would be welcomed, I&#39;m sure. Not sure if those less savory ingredients would be readily available, but... well. As mentioned, I have contacts with people who could quite possibly get you access to those sort of materials, provided you do something for them in return.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She remained in her casual repose as she watched Hiraeth cook, her glassy eyes following the ingredients as they were added to what became a stew. In the background, Ven continued thieving from the scraps, swallowing chunks whole until there was nothing left. 

&quot;At any rate, I am willing to make anyone&#39;s acquaintance.&quot; Her gaze lifted from the pot and towards Hiraeth again.

With a slightly put-upon sigh, she pulled up the hem of her skirt enough to reveal a surprisingly short leg stump, cut off about halfway up her thigh. As the fabric shifted away, it also revealed the rest of the rogue leg, which looked relatively believable for the most part, clearly wrapped up and dressed to make it resemble a normal limb as much as possible. But the topmost sections of it, above the artificial knee joint, were where the fa&#231;ade faded away and it was easily apparent that this was a prosthetic, meant to be strapped to her remaining body. Hands well practiced in their movements retrieved the displaced leg by the upper socket, carefully fixing it back in place and redoing a couple of buckles that held it snug.

&quot;I really ought to craft a garter belt of sorts to ensure it stays put,&quot; she muttered absentmindedly, almost to herself. What flashes of bare skin Hiraeth would be able to see before the prosthetic was fitted back in place were sickly pale, almost more colorless than the complexion of her face, and absolutely mutilated in warped scar tissues. The amputation looked to have been a bit on the messy side... but then again, the stump of her missing arm had a similar appearance.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A more cultured sort might have averted their eyes in some combination of modesty and not wanting to be caught staring at the injury or the glimpses of thigh, scarred as they might be. But Hiraeth had no such inclination, and simply observed for a moment before he turned his attention to the pot, taking out a wooden spoon and lifting the lid to dip the spoon in, stirring the contents to make sure they didn&#39;t burn to the bottom, and spooning the broth over the top of the grouse to help infuse the moisture, covering it again.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Leaning forward, he checked the pot, and inhaled deeply at the mouth-watering aroma of the grouse. He scooted in - didn&#39;t have plates to divide it out between them, so he simply set the pot between them and offered her his fork.

He scooted back a little and removed the tattered woolen scarf around his shoulders, folding it up into a little pillow and arranging himself to lay down on his back. &quot;...Is your friend alright to eat cooked bones?

Gazing up at the stars overhead, watching the lazy trails of smoke from the fire, he heaved a deep and contented sigh, the tip of his tail seeming to pluck at the flames and almost pull them from the fire, like it was magnetized.

His sister, Valentine, is a bartender at the Creeping Root Inn. Otherwise he&#39;s been known to lurk around the Stray Coin Tavern, where the shady characters tend to gather. But that place doesn&#39;t tend to be a very good place for him to have his daughter along with, so...&quot; Hiraeth steered her toward the Inn first, and it seemed his guess was correct. Upon entering the inn, he gestured over to the bar where Jaska sat with Axa in his lap, conversing idly with Valentine and nursing a drink.

Jaska glanced over and did a bit of a double-take upon recognizing Hiraeth and taking in the disheveled state of both the druid and his unfamiliar companion, arching a brow but sending a nod to Hiraeth in greeting regardless.

&quot;Good afternoon Jaska, Valentine, Axa. This is Cassiana, she&#39;s new in town.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I figured as much,&quot; Jaska drawled. &quot;I think I would have remembered seeing her around.&quot; He noted Cass&#39;s cloudy eye, and glanced back to Valentine&#39;s similar clouded gaze briefly. Was she blind as well?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“A pleasure. Hiraeth speaks very positively of you,” she said, her tone still that nearly sleepy murmur it always had been. And while her eyes were foggy in a way that did certainly resemble Valentine’s condition, those eyes also met Jaska’s gaze perfectly, implying at least a moderate degree of eyesight—though there was something very nearly corpse like in the appearance of her eyes, sighted or not.

Valentine, meanwhile, remained as blind as ever, not interjecting on the meeting, but politely smiling and listening along, nodding warmly towards Hiraeth as she was greeted.

Axa’s eyes were squarely on Cassiana, though. But as ever, her body language and (nonexistent) expressions were hard to get a read on.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

When did <em>anyone</em> aside from Valentine ever speak positively of him? But he recovered after a moment, and even offered a bit of a crooked smile. &quot;Does he, now?&quot;

Hiraeth led Cass over to the bar and propped his staff against it as he eased himself into a seat. &quot;I might have pointed her in your direction regarding some of her interests. Not sure if they&#39;re areas you cover, but it seemed worth a shot.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That felt like a positive review to her.

She shifted up to sit beside Hiraeth, carefully helping herself into the barstool with slightly more effort than it would take the average person, though none of that seeped into her demeanor. 

“It is, admittedly, hard to find work that suits my skill set,” she hummed, her smoke hand delicately tilting her staff to rest it against the counter, before turning her full attention to Jaska. 

“I am an herbalist, and I am well versed in potions, poultices, and similar remedies. But these practices are largely through way of repurposing the dead, and as you can likely imagine, such are not the most mainstream methods. Especially seeing as I have little in the way of moral quandaries about how ingredients are obtained.”

She spoke plainly, but her voice was low and soft enough that the words were rather well kept amongst immediate company.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She did not completely pull the material out, not making a mess on the bar top, but in the cup of her fingers was a sand-like material of a dark burgundy color. It had a noticeable but not unpleasant scent, rather earthy and rich, and bits of leaves could be glimpsed in the mixture.

“Discretion is intrinsic when suspicion is never raised in the first place,” she murmured, the barest lilt of amusement in her words.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
