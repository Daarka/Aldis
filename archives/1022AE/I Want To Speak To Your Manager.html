An unpleasant matter, spoken to a person who had not yet proven to be unpleasant herself, but came from a historically unpleasant race in his experience.

Matters of the magical components they&#39;d gathered taken care of, he turned to head to Altaira&#39;s office. And while he&#39;d done what he could to wash the ink off of him, there was only so much that could be done when bathing in swamp water.

Using the head of his scepter, he tapped out a knock on her door.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-979195483379597374 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=979195483379597374><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 25, 2022 7:33 PM">7:33 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>[ <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="daarka">@Daarka</span>  ]</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She seemed unsurprised to see him back in town, looking up with a polite smile.

&quot;Welcome back. I see the swamp has accompanied you on your return.&quot; In fairness, she sounded more amused than displeased by this, though that alleged amusement was muted and refined. &quot;What can I do for you, Achoris?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He wasn&#39;t quite comfortable enough around her to sit, but he did approach the chair in front of her desk, standing behind it and lightly holding his was scepter propped against the floor, hands folded over the Set-shaped head of it where it rested near his collar. &quot;I have heard that you have held training sessions with the hunters of your guild.

&quot;Let&#39;s see. Most recently, I organized a training exercise of a rather... <em>battle royale</em> nature, with magical securities in place to ensure death was not a possible outcome. Kaskra participated in this, where he and a tiefling named Jaska were the final two left alive. Their standoff was long and delicate, but eventually, Jaska prevailed as the winner.&quot; She tilted her head slightly, looking over the man in front of her with a curiosity of clearly seeking what his motives were in asking.

&quot;I take it this is more than a passing curiosity of yours.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Primal. Less swayed by emotion. I did not come here looking to give Kaskra an excuse for his behavior, but I wonder if a battle royale-styled training session instilled some sort of justification to not only work to the detriment of his teammates, but also to cause a significant amount of friendly fire.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;... Lizardfolk do tend to function with less emotion than other races,&quot; she agreed, her words measured as she thought, &quot;But that does not inherently equate to less intelligence. In my experience, Kaskra is more than intelligent enough to understand that such a training exercise was, in effect, sparring, and not a reflection of how he should conduct himself on the field.&quot; A beat. 

&quot;I very much would like to know, explicitly, what he has done to prompt this visit.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I&#39;ll elaborate more on that in a moment.&quot;

He took a moment to organize his thoughts. &quot;While we were tracking the location of our quarry, we encountered a troll and some orcs engaging in friendly sparring, and they invited us in to join.&quot; Achoris gestured toward himself. &quot;As I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware, aside from cantrips, warlocks have a very limited capacity for spells - but the spells we do cast, we do it <em>well.</em> These people were looking for a good time, and I thought it would be entertaining for all - but mostly for me - to cast a spell of darkness on the majority of the combatants. While it certainly didn&#39;t help out my teammates, this was a friendly battle and not a life or death situation, and it didn&#39;t hurt anyone, either.&quot;

The aasimar&#39;s expression flattened out somewhat. &quot;Almost immediately, Kaskra extinguished that darkness by dropping a spell of sickening radiance on the entire group. It tore through the lot of us save himself and Niamh, who managed to resist its effects. Clove and Cairn were both nearly killed by it - and Kaskra <em>did</em> kill the troll who invited us to this spar. If not for Cassiana&#39;s quick action in reviving him, we would have lost what turned out to be a valuable source of information, and we were fortunate that he thought he simply passed out.&quot;

He spread his hand to the side. &quot;That was only the <em>first</em> instance of friendly fire and poor spell etiquette.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The swamp was filled to the brim with creatures covered in egg sack-like pustules, frog men, and swarming manta-like aberrations. I had moved ahead of the group, clearing a path and preventing several creatures from swarming the others - they seemed fixated on Niamh for some reason - and had reached the pile of bodies that wound up convalescing into our main target.&quot;

Achoris&#39; lips thinned briefly. &quot;I am at my most lethal when focused on a singular enemy within melee distance. Kaskra, from the other end of the glade, cast his sickening radiance again <em>right on top of me</em> and the pile of bodies. And if I had not been able to resist its effects, it would have torn through my armor of Agathys, which up until that point hadn&#39;t yet been touched. As it was, I was forced to retreat immediately, and was unable to fight at maximum capacity as he effectively limited me to cantrips and also prevented the rest of the group from getting into melee range.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;It would appear, then, that Kaskra does not know how to make proper use of such magic. Perhaps I have overestimated his intelligence--or perhaps assumed his wisdom <em>matched</em> his intelligence.&quot;

She let out that breath in a quiet sigh. &quot;You have my deepest apologies, Achoris, for his unprofessionalism. The guild is indiscriminate with many things; we will make a hunter out of an individual of any race, any creed, any gender, nationality, appearance, or disability, and I do not care what magic or martial art our hunters practice, be it simple wizardry, or the darkest of necromancy. The one thing I will not tolerate is a lack of proper teamwork.&quot;

She pushed herself forward, rising to her feet, where she very nearly met Achoris&#39; eye level. &quot;Thank you for prioritizing informing me of this matter. I can see you would likely much prefer to be returning to the comforts of civilization at the moment,&quot; she noted, nodding towards the ink staining him, &quot;and I appreciate the importance this issue takes ahead of such comforts in your mind. It, likewise, is of great importance to myself, as well. I will speak to Kaskra. If he is not able to appropriately reassure me that these incidents will not occur again, he will not be present on the next mission. All I ask of you is that you allow me to handle the matter myself, and do not confront him personally, lest it breed unnecessary animosity and conflict amongst our ranks.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Regardless, I have always been a creature of knowledge,&quot; she murmured, gesturing to the various cabinets--presumably full of countless files--sitting regally in the room around her. &quot;When I resided in Xhorhas, it was in some of the highest echelons of the dynasty. As you can imagine, the crown is deeply invested in knowledge such as what has become of those wanted for treason. Though it has been many years since I moved about those halls, I am nothing if not a vessel of information networks. I do not know of everyone Ashira enslaved... but the man who killed her was certainly noteworthy.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It would stand to reason he gave full details to whatever officer spoke to him, but if you are asking what I know of Ashira&#39;s death? The account given to the crown was that she was eaten. It was only through divination magic that his story and Ashira&#39;s death could be confirmed, as there was no body remaining that could be brought back to Xhorhas as evidence. The person responsible was described in quite crude terms in regards to this behavior, but also noted, visually, as having elongated limbs and lightless eyes.&quot; The way she evenly met his gaze seemed to resoundingly imply that she had known all along what kind of fuckery he was up to.

The guild, indeed, did not discriminate.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Let <em>that</em> be a lesson in hubris, and bring testament to playing the long game, biding one&#39;s time waiting for that perfect opportunity, and revenge being a dish best served cold. All while having been severely malnourished and having a gag or bit in his mouth so often that he&#39;d had to constantly have his cracked and broken teeth healed, cut off from his magic.

&quot;That will do. I&#39;ll write up a list of names and races of the other people she kept captive and have it to you within the week.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
