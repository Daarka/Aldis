You are all left standing in a grassy, trampled field where the &quot;building&quot; had been moments prior, most of you still injured to some extent, as Dr. Stein bids you a curt farewell and teleports back to whence he came, taking the whole disaster with him (and leaving you with a promise of 700 gold pieces each waiting for you back with Altaira).

The road back is long and tired, but infinitely less eventful.

You arrive back in Fielbarry in record time, collecting your payments and, for some, taking much-needed baths--the order of these priorities varying amongst you. As payment is collected, Altaira informs you that as an extension of your payment, your tab for this evening only will be covered by the guild for food and drink at the Creeping Root Inn. Once there, any friends in town who had not joined you on your mission are able to mingle and hear about your adventure (or nightmare, depending on who&#39;s asked), and you are all, for better or for worse, finding yourself breaking bread once more with those you fought alongside.

Valentine is as accommodating as ever, and full of her usual warmth as she ensures you all have just about any dish or drink you can request, a hospitality that takes some of the strain of your trials off your mind, and helps soothe you back into civilized living. 

Niamh returns with a silver bell in the shape of a howling wolf&#39;s head, which has been identified already by Kaskra as a wondrous item capable of detecting the nearness of shapeshifters. She also gained an electrum coin with a curious dual-faced design, unlike any she has seen for traditional currency before, and brought back a shield made entirely of iron as well. Clove carries a new acorn-shaped bell she did not have before, with unknown properties. 

The evening, and all its well-deserved comforts, are yours.

There was a bit of a haunted look in his eyes, flinching away from anyone who got too close to his personal space. Any attempts at conversation had been met with short, curt answers, and his normal quiet, withdrawn demeanor was nothing short of prickly.

By the time they&#39;d managed to get back and he was able to clean the blood and pus out of his hair and skin, he was half-tempted to just stay home... But he was ravenously hungry, and the idea of preparing a satisfying meal was exhausting, and so he went to the tavern to take advantage of the free meal. He sat hunched over a meal of roasted pheasant and wild rice in a creamy mushroom sauce, eyes heavily-lidded as he ate, occasionally breaking away to take a drink of hot apple cider or eat some of the fresh buttered bread that had also been brought out.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She knew enough of his struggles to confidently presume some things, and so she lingered near his side through the travels home, mindful to be present without crowding him. When sharing a saddle, she often leaned forward into his back, but notably never wrapped her arms around him. 

Once they had both gotten cleaned up, with the acrid smell of faintly-acidic bodily fluids washed off Kaleva and foul, rot-smelling dried blood washed off Skena, she seemed to be in agreement that there was no harm in taking advantage of a free meal. If necessary, they could excuse themselves as soon as they were fed and come back home for some much needed alone time. &quot;Alone&quot;, of course, referring to them being alone together. 

She obtained a much smaller, simpler meal consisting of a single but rich-looking slice of coffee cake, and sat herself down at Kaleva&#39;s side to meekly nibble away at it, looking similarly tired as the tiefling--but with her focus seeming to be entirely on her friend, a quiet, gentle concern evident in her demeanor.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

To Skena he said, &quot;I don&#39;t think the incident with the werewolves had anything to do with the Steins. I need to get in contact with the order and report what happened.

No less identifiable without the customary mushroom hat, Clove stepped quietly into the room.

Their hair was unbraided and wild, cascading around their overly large and pointed goblin ears. Their hair was a full shade lighter than the brown tones their friends were accustomed to seeing. Hiding under the mimic table had dripped enough ichor onto Clove&#39;s head that a full bath had been necessary, no matter how disagreeable the endeavor. 

A wide grin revealed a mouth too full of teeth, yet this managed to be charming rather than threatening when accompanied by Clove&#39;s eyes crinkling in happy amusement at seeing some of her party members and friends. A soft chime accompanied each quiet movement, as the newly acquired acorn bell was displayed in a natural hole at the corner of one large ear. Clove appeared quite proud at the gentle sounds it created.

Clove rocked back and forth on their heels for a moment, debating whether a drink was fancied before casually approaching Kaskra. Blinking twice, Clove pulled the acorn off the small hook which had converted it to an earring. 

&quot;If, ah.. when you&#39;re done working on your skull, I was wondering if you could have a look at the acorn? Like you studied the wolf bell?&quot;

Clove had been very impressed with Kaskra&#39;s Identification of Niamh&#39;s wolf bell. While delighted with the acorn already, Clove couldn&#39;t help being curious if secrets lurked beneath it&#39;s surface as well.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It took a second of confused anxiety, before she registered what Nils had been referring to, also looking a little sheepish.

But she couldn’t help but notice how Cha Cha seemed to almost refuse to look at her, and her posture curled inward somewhat. Swallowing, she turned her soft murmuring back to Kaleva. “I don’t know if they make house calls… but I can send a message to Roots if you’d prefer to speak with her outside of town, given how tired we both are.”

She said tired, but what she meant was <em>rattled by trauma</em>.

The other corpselike cleric, however, was perfectly at ease, carefully settling herself down beside Nils. “You remind me of an old man refusing to embrace new inventions,” she noted amusedly. “Perhaps you ought to start studying the arcane yourself. Get with the times, as they say.” Her tone seemed to imply she was very likely not being remotely serious.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

No less identifiable without the customary mushroom hat, Clove stepped quietly into the room.

Their hair was unbraided and wild, cascading around their overly large and pointed goblin ears. Their hair was a full shade lighter than the brown tones their friends were accustomed to seeing. Hiding under the mimic table had dripped enough ichor onto Clove&#39;s head that a full bath had been necessary, no matter how disagreeable the endeavor. 

A wide grin revealed a mouth too full of teeth, yet this managed to be charming rather than threatening when accompanied by Clove&#39;s eyes crinkling in happy amusement at seeing some of her party members and friends. A soft chime accompanied each quiet movement, as the newly acquired acorn bell was displayed in a natural hole at the corner of one large ear. Clove appeared quite proud at the gentle sounds it created.

Clove rocked back and forth on their heels for a moment, debating whether a drink was fancied before casually approaching Kaskra. Blinking twice, Clove pulled the acorn off the small hook which had converted it to an earring. 

&quot;If, ah.. when you&#39;re done working on your skull, I was wondering if you could have a look at the acorn? Like you studied the wolf bell?&quot;

Clove had been very impressed with Kaskra&#39;s Identification of Niamh&#39;s wolf bell. While delighted with the acorn already, Clove couldn&#39;t help being curious if secrets lurked beneath it&#39;s surface as well. </span></div></div><div class=chatlog__header><span class=chatlog__author style=color:rgb(183,133,159) title=_trash_goblin data-user-id=267100801669922818>Birdfolk</span> <span class=chatlog__timestamp title="Saturday, October 22, 2022 9:38 PM"><a href=#chatlog__message-container-1033600217431412826>10/22/2022 9:38 PM</a></span></div><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Kaskra looked up from the skull as Clove approached and gave her a little wave.

Did we pull anything else out of that mess, or was it just the bells?</em>&quot;

The last question aside, he rummaged through his pack to produce the pearl-tipped owl quill he had used during the missing. It certainly wasn&#39;t anything spectacular, but all the same it was one of the few items he carried that was free of absolutely any blemish, and even in holding it he seemed to pay a fair amount of attention to not bend it unnecessarily. 

With another lick, he&#39;d go through the motions again. Very, very softly a voice not his own (or maybe it is and he&#39;s just weird about speaking when not using magic) would mumble the words of the ritual as his left hand turned the little acorn bell over and over to inspect it, and his right would scrawl his findings in the air beside him with the help of the quill.

Minutes passed, but finally he seemed satisfied. &quot;<em>That&#39;s a handy little charm you have. Just in case the notes are confusing: you should have better luck communicating with plants now, and any plant creature should be able to understand you just fine without any need for other magical interventions.</em>&quot;

This small, polished acorn has been made into a magical bell that rings softly when moved.

And a personal loss - she kept reminding herself that the little guy wouldn&#39;t have felt much of anything, wouldn&#39;t have noticed the nauseating substance and the way it burned against the skin, but losing him beneath the ooze had left her stomach in knots nonetheless.

Tiny claws pricking her skin aside, the relief was palpable - the groaning from her stomach though, was audible, and she was suddenly grateful for the guild sponsored meal that she was already late for.

After a few minutes of hastily dressing into a pair of clean cream breeches, a soft turquoise blouse, and drawing sweeping lines of kohl over her bright eyes, Niamh and the wee boy were trotting over to Valentine&#39;s.

Skena had been periodically distracted by the Nordic men’s hijinks, but as things settled again, she reached her magic out to silently contact Kaleva’s superior. A few moments passed, before her eyes refocused, and she turned her head to murmur softly to him, “She said she can drop by later this evening; from the sound of it, it’ll be after we get back, even if we did end up staying in town late, so we shouldn’t need to worry about hurrying.”


As late afternoon crept on and the tavern crested into its peak of business, there was the arguably small detail of a particular individual settling themselves down on an empty chair near the door. A detail that would undoubtedly be overlooked if it wasn’t for the distinct and potentially disturbing appearance of this individual, with murky sea-green complexion, short hair the color of oxblood, strange legs, mandibles instead of a humanoid mouth, and two empty sockets where eyes should have been, accented by a third, intact eye of sickly yellow on the forehead over them. That eye squinted comfortably, it’s small pupil idly shifting about the tavern’s patrons. And perhaps most notably was that the androgynous and alien looking individual had the long, chitinous tail of a massive scorpion.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, October 24, 2022 3:51 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“I can confirm they came from the south, but unfortunately, I cannot educate you on their race. It’s been bugging me, actually.” A pause. “Pun not intended. Regardless, they seem rather pleasant.” She smiled warmly at the men. 

“I’ve hired them to help with any removals of problem patrons, should such things arise.”

Which was a bit odd; despite the alien appearance, the stranger was thin as a twig. Chitinous, yes, but not particularly muscled, nor very large in build in general. The tail looked entirely incapable of prehensile gripping, though whether or not the implication was that problem patrons would end up stung remained to be seen. If anything, it was the labeling of the almost unnaturally narrow creature (that looked as though Cha Cha could snap them in half over his knee) as a bouncer that was more unsettling than if it had been a big, brawny orc at the door.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Petra, dear? No one&#39;s in trouble, and they&#39;re welcome to stay in my tavern--but these men seem interested in experiencing being thrown out by you. Would you mind obliging them?&quot;

The alien figure&#39;s single intact eye turned to face Val as they were addressed, but they said nothing. Didn&#39;t seem to be really emoting, either. But they didn&#39;t sit there staring blankly for long, rising to their feet a brief moment later and turning their attention back towards the two large men, as their tail relaxed out behind them to almost float over the floor. They moved slow, almost lazily, in a way that presented a demeanor Nils might find similar to how Eidunn had held herself when she had all her limbs. This <em>Petra</em> had no weapons, no apparent armor, dressed only in loose and unnoteworthy trousers that were cut off towards the knees, and an even looser, poncho-like top of dark, muddy greys and blacks. Twig-thin arms hung casually at their sides as their odd, insectoid feet clicked their little talons on the hardwood with each step, unhurriedly heading towards Nils and Cha Cha.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Curious. An intrigued hum - or rather, puff of air - left him as he made a mental note to check up on that later.

Or maybe they were Just Like That, which was altogether a different kind of power move. That wasn&#39;t even getting into the lack of obvious weapons or armor.
Perhaps he was questioning why he signed up to be the bouncer&#39;s guinea pig.

What did you even say to someone coming over to throw you out?
He raised a hand in a friendly greeting, scooting his food a little more securely onto the bar as he stood up from his stool. &quot;Hail. Just a bout of friendly scrapping, aye?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At least, not a verbal one. They turned to look towards Nils as he spoke, and for a moment, there was nothing in their expressionless face. 

And then their face itself <em>unfurled</em>.

Mandibles that had laid so flush against their jaw that the extent of them was easily missed now stretched wide, fanning out to an alarming degree. The lower jaw, too, spread open, full of sinew and strange stretches of crisscrossing muscles, lined in countless little razor-sharp teeth that should not, by all that was normal with humanoids, be there. The flesh within the mouth was barely pink, much closer to a shade of grey with how desaturated and very nearly <em>dead</em> it looked, but all just slick enough with saliva to make the sight that much worse. At the center, towards the back of their throat, was a ragged stump of muscle: a tongue that had been violently cut out.

While they maintained a very human-like silhouette to their skull normally, all pretense dropped away when the various pieces and appendages that made up their mouthparts were splayed wide--and suddenly, Nils was looking at the upper part of a mostly human face that, from the cheekbones down, was practically exploded into a grotesque, alien horror, framed in the rather aquatic-looking frills of fins that lined their neck like needle-pointed spines. And as their jaw unwound itself in all its unnatural ways, a rattling hiss rose from them. Almost snake-like, but deep and... worse. The eyes they should have had were long gone, only hollow cavities that resembled the interior of the mouth in color, if not a bit darker--but the one unnatural eye on their forehead was boring into Nils. 

Then there was an odd, jerking gesture, like their wrist had been yanked by a marionette string, raising it in Nils&#39; direction and, with another oddly jerking twist, flexing what little muscle existed in that arm until their tendons were visible on the back of their hand.

Provided he did not immediately lose his composure, he might have the mind enough to note how the odd sensation--shapeless, incorporeal pressure that seemed to firmly grip him despite having no tangible form--was very similar to the smaller scale of it he experienced when trying to hold Cassiana&#39;s missing hand. Except her &quot;grip&quot; strength with that spectral appendage was quite weak, especially in comparison to this effect causing total paralysis. 

He would have plenty of time to sit there and dwell on the sensation, though, as once the spell took hold, Petra&#39;s attention immediately snapped back to Cha Cha.

Despite <em>looking</em> frail and entirely without mass, Petra took the blow shockingly well. Straight to the chest, that horrible hiss hiccupping slightly as the wind momentarily left their lungs. But they didn&#39;t even stagger back a step--and Cha Cha would find the impact felt... hard. Not like any chest he was used to punching. It was shaped strangely beneath that loose-fitting poncho, in a way he couldn&#39;t immediately make sense of from just that brief contact. Furthermore, it was <em>hard</em>. Like hitting the shell of a massive beetle, not flesh.

Some of those mysteries were solved a moment later, as there was a flurry from under the poncho&#39;s fabric--and <em>two more</em> arms whipped out. These were a bit thicker than the original pair, but most importantly, ended not in hands, but in two long, narrow pincers. He barely had time to see them and register what they were before they had clamped down on him, latching onto his wrists one after another. The grip was like a vice, not quite threatening to crush his bones, but still deeply uncomfortable and feeling nearly impossible to simply wriggle out of. On each claw, the insides were lined with occasional, subtle bumps that came to narrow points, creating a lazy sort of serration that made the grip have just that much more traction.

And then, leaving Nils where he was frozen for the moment, the horrific creature began to haul their weight backwards, dragging Cha Cha towards the door with strength that easily kept pace with the horsing around he did with Nils, despite their drastically lesser mass. 
<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">25 to hit with snippy snappy bits. Cha Cha takes 8 bludgeoning damage.
bonus action, Petra attempts to grapple him and succeeds with an Athletics check of 24 unless he can beat that with an athletics/acrobatics roll of his own. Narratively I already wrote that it succeeded because i confused myself with order of operations here, but if you roll higher, he can just immediately slip out and take his next turn as normal. Nils is up next to attempt to save again (WIS, DC 15)</code></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;What the- th&#39;hell&#39;re these? Ya got fuckin <em>claws?</em>&quot; He yelled, as though that too were <em>also</em> some form of unfair magics.

Unable to break free from the grip, he ended up simply dangling like a very heavy weight, wriggling and scrabbling for some sort of purchase.

Which would make perfect sense, if that were the case.

Nils&#39; forward momentum didn&#39;t seem to account for this unnatural solidity, and with a shift of one foot back to brace themselves and a flair of their tail for balance, Petra was not knocked prone. 

Once they were sure they maintained their balance, they wasted no time in attempting to give the tiefling the same treatment Cha Cha had received. But while they were deft and heavy to hit, the shield between their claws and Nils&#39; body created some complications; they seemed to lack the deftness to reach around such an obstacle with the same efficiency that they could attack directly with.

Though their tail flexed and hovered, occasionally dipping forward like it might thrust down and attempt to pierce the tiefling, it never quite committed to engaging. Instead, they hauled on Nils&#39; shield, attempting to not push it back against him, but pry it to the side enough to get a better angle. It seemed like it was going to be just as fruitless as their other recent attempts had been.

And then something flared in their single remaining eye. Like a ripple of light hitting the surface of the feature, or something else that was not <em>entirely</em> overt as being anything more than just a trick of the light, but looked a little <em>too</em> distinct to be just a natural glimmer. As Nils flexed and braced against them, a split second occurred where they seemed to perfectly predict his movements, and a claw darted in at the opening to snap shut around his neck--

But there was no surge of suffocating pain. The pincers snapped closed around the collar of his tunic, sparing his throat from their snare, but holding him just as firmly. Especially as the second claw latched around the edge of his shield, granting Petra leverage against it so he couldn&#39;t keep thrusting her back with it. 

Finally managing to get the grip on him they were seeking, they dug their heels in and began hauling him out the door as they had Cha Cha.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1034671060295106643 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1034671060295106643><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, October 25, 2022 8:33 PM">8:33 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">Nils is grappled; he can take any action he likes, but his movement is 0.

With their feet not planted firmly on the ground as they lunged, Petra seemed to lack the leverage to stand firm against the shove this time, and it caught them just off balance enough to actually topple the overgrown scorpion this time. It was odd; they sounded less like a meaty thud hitting the ground, and more like the solid, muffled clatter of carapace crashing into floorboards instead. 

Only dazed a moment, they began to gather themselves back to their feet, reaching out to once again attempt to snare them in the <em>same damn magic</em> because they weren&#39;t convinced that wasn&#39;t a dead horse worth beating.

Yet to be noticed by anyone was yet another tiefling up in the rafters of the tavern, but he blended in well with the shadows, sitting with his back against a support beam, one leg drawn up loosely while the other stretched out on a horizontal beam, idly playing with a butterfly knife as it spun and twisted around nimble fingers.

Fishing around in the pouch at her hip for a moment, she pulled free the gently twinkling lycan bell. She considered it briefly as she started turning it over in her hand, still unsure of what to do with it. It was of little use to her since the thing would go off whenever she wandered close to it - not much of an alarm. She&#39;d hold onto it for someone else perhaps.

&quot;Here Kaskra - why not start with this? Cool stuff is one of my favorite parts of the missions,&quot; she added, casting a wink and a toothy grin down at the boy.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Jaska, of course--but trying to glean any other signs of life up there felt like a very hard game of I-Spy. Maybe it was someone currently invisible. That would make more sense than the idea that someone was just up there and somehow hiding in plain sight with how intently Niamh was looking. 

And then a cold chill ran up her neck, as she suddenly found herself locking eyes with two beady red gleams in the shadows. Something about the shape in the dim corners the tavern lights struggled to fully reach was... nothing <em>overtly</em> horrific, and yet the lightly obscured silhouette somehow felt... very wrong. In ways that didn&#39;t make sense. 

Because it was a very small tiefling child, probably no older than seven years or so, with a pale complexion and similarly pale hair that hung straight, ending about at her shoulders, with many strands hanging over her face and partially over those red eyes. She had the stubby beginnings of young horns growing from her forehead, and a tail that was lightly wrapped around the beam she sat on--one level higher than where Jaska sat, but otherwise near to his position--and she was perched, crouching there like a gargoyle, with a face completely void of any expression. 

Nothing about those details was bothersome. But <em>something</em> about her <em>was</em>, in a way very difficult to explain. Not to mention the knife she had apparently hurled with commendable aim directly at Niamh.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

However, the strangeness of the number of tieflings could be excused by the blatant familiarity shared between three of those now present. The man who walked in had soft lavender skin, and long, lightly curling hair that somehow encompassed every color of the sunset. His horns curled like a ram&#39;s around his pointed ears, his pupilless eyes a warm butter yellow. The familial relation to Valentine would be impossible to deny - and it connected the tiefling in the rafters as family as well, though Jaska shared as many differences as similarities. His skin was a touch darker and grayer lavender, and only one eye was yellow, the other blood red and containing a cat-like slitted pupil. His horns were shaped differently too, segmented and swept back, his indigo hair only just turning purple at the nape of his neck before it ended, but it gave the impression that if it had been allowed to grow longer, it would contain more colors as his siblings&#39; hair did.

But where Jaska moved like the glint on the edge of a knife, sharp and deadly, with a similarly dangerous vibe to his personality, the new tiefling was warmth and kindness made flesh, gentle and soft as he leaned over the bar to greet Valentine and kiss her cheek as he settled in.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Despite the boy&#39;s distinctively lawful streak, he was still a 14 year old, easily persuaded to do cool stuff, for better or for worse. Besides, it couldn&#39;t hurt to practice magic in a place <em>suited</em> to do so, and not in the kitchen surrounded by silverware and food.


Arriving a respectable pause after the tiefling was a somewhat-haggard looking man. From a distance he looked almost human, though the point to his ears suggested otherwise. His hair was wild, loosely pulled back into a braid as though in afterthought, laced with the occasional brambled vine. He wore loose working clothes with just enough belts, jewelry, and other extravagance to suggest he&#39;d either once been well kept or at least well-paid. As he was now, he looked and sounded a bit hollow like your average has-been, and waltzed into the bar like it was an old friend.

&quot;Hey, Valentine. Get me a whiskey, yeah?&quot; He purred a lazy greeting, settling himself at the bar to ignore everyone else at the time being.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;It&#39;s fine, honestly.&quot; He said, pausing to take a large swig from the glass. &quot;The past has a funny way of.. creeping up when you least expect it. You gonna be okay?&quot;

It was a funny way of deflecting his <em>own</em> scare downstairs. If he just focused on Luka, making sure <em>he</em> was ok, he could ignore that. The wine helped too.

&quot;You are welcome in my room as well, if you need a safe corner to process in. We can talk about things further there, if you wish.&quot; She tilted her head slightly towards Axa&#39;s position at her father&#39;s feet, the little girl looking just as on edge as he did.

Jaska assembled the pages once he was certain all the relevant ones were removed, passing them into Valentine&#39;s hand after folding them over. He was still breathing heavily, still trying to process, staring at the hateful book with a snarl on his lips.

That tension abruptly exploded in the air, and Jaska slammed his blade into the book, stabbing into it over and over in a frenzy of violent motions that he barely seemed conscious of doing.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And then she simply stood as Jaska stabbed the journal. Her expression had softened to one of quiet sympathy, but she made no move to stop him, no twist of wanting to on her features. As she listened, though, her keen ear picked up the shallowed breaths of the small child in the mix, and after a moment, her voice gently piped up again. 

&quot;Jaska, beautiful brother--you&#39;re upsetting your daughter.&quot; The words were soft, barely more than whispers. &quot;If you need to go somewhere to vent, I can take her back to my room with Luka and myself, assuming you do not want to be there, too.&quot;

Clove shrugged, knowing Kaskra would go his own way, but glad to have reminded him that help would come, if needed.

He slowly turned his upper body to look to Axa, reaching a hand out to cup the back of her head, murmuring in Infernal. &quot;<em>Es tut mir leid, dass ich dich ver&#228;rgert habe. Was brauchst du gerade?</em>&quot;

She was clever and advanced beyond her years, but she was still a child. A child who couldn&#39;t comprehend the importance of why he was asking her to stay while he left, because she just lacked the capacity to think that far ahead and grapple with the reality that she probably <em>would</em> be less upset staying with Valentine. All she could see was what was right in front of her, which was a <em>deep</em>-seated desire to not part from him. 

She said nothing, not looking up, but ultimately released her grip. Valentine listened to this exchange with a softened expression. As Axa pulled away, she offered a hand out--not to the girl, but palm-up towards Jaska. 

&quot;... If you&#39;d prefer, I can hang onto that while you&#39;re out,&quot; she offered gently. &quot;Keep it safe. It might prove useful, anyways.

She was standing in the middle of the Tavern now. Part of her torn between some small sense that wanted to see where Jaska had gone. Offer something. A word he probably would not appreciate, but sympathy all the same. It turned her inside out to think there was something more, it was easier just to dislike someone. 

The other, still sane part of her wanted to stay until closing and bask in the warmth and relative quietly of the now partially emptied bar. 

&quot;I mean...I don&#39;t think they are coming back...&quot; Dog was not leashed, but still only took two partial steps to lean forward and try to glean what might be on those unfinished plates as well. Very well trained.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Acknowledgement of how clearly nervous seeing them had made Yarrow—though the observation was… careful. Not malicious or domineering, nor even teasing. A shapeless wondering at the degree of separation between the man standing before them, and the circumstances they had crossed paths in before. Perhaps, in that thought alone, was a faint thread of worry, though well muted without confirmation of it being warranted.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, November 2, 2022 11:30 AM">(edited)</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=eyes><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=👀 src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/twitter/twemoji@latest/assets/svg/1f440.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

The sudden explosive yelling from inside, as well as the departure of two individuals not long after, had drawn his curiosity even more.

If this was a regular occurrence in the little town, he just <em>knew</em> he was going to enjoy his time here.

And so he wandered in, peering around the inside to see just who was left - just in time to see a bog witch feed her(?) dog from scraps left on the table by departing patrons. For whatever reason, this earned a snort of amusement from him.

What the others inside saw was the sudden appearance of a tall, well-groomed elf with golden scales and a long, dark braid worn around his shoulders like a scarf. His clothing was modest - a simple leather jacket over white shirt, belted trousers and boots that had a rather &#39;lived in&#39; look to them. The only ornamentation was a set of silver, brass and gold keys dangling from a leather cord around his neck.

&quot;Y&#39;sure that&#39;s healthy for the pooch, miss?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
