No matter what she tried to redirect herself with, she found herself trying to catch the direction Jaska had gone. 

Dog wasn&#39;t entirely helpful. Without a clear indication of WHO Jaska was, why he was following and the time that passed the creature had meandered around the front of the establishment for a few moments with his bewildered owner. Piper didn&#39;t push, she was just as apprehensive to find herself under shade and struggling to discern exactly what might be dangerous. 

Still, she held herself high. Shoulders squared and her pace deliberate she would trek on and hopefully not far to find him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Jaska was slouched in a back alley, the ember of his cigarette reflecting in the crimson of his cat-like eye, casting a faint light off his harsh features and leaving the rest of him mostly in shadow.

Those features immediately shifted to Piper and Dog, staring at the two of them intently.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I have questions.&quot; She was trying so hard to keep her voice even. 
&quot;Not about what happened. About after. The anger.&quot; 

She was focused on the only real lights she could see. The reflection off of his strange eye and the smolder of the clove cigarette. She&#39;d heard once that it easy to see light in the eyes of a predator, something about hunting better in the dark? 
Why did she have to remember that now?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His hand was stained with something dark and wet. And when he dropped the cigarette to the ground and snuffed its meager ember with his boot, he stepped forward into the light of one of the nearby street lamps.

His hands had smears of blood on them, his clothes splattered with the same. Apparently that anger had been turned on some unfortunate person. The alley was dark, maybe they were still there.

&quot;Ask them, then,&quot; he said shortly.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Was it appropriate for him to talk about sex as a means of blowing off steam to a teenager? Probably not. Did he care? No. If she was going to talk to him while he was covered in the blood of whatever poor sap crossed his path earlier, he figured she could take it.

The second caused a barely there flush to her cheeks. It wasn&#39;t alien to her. There was no one in her age range here, anyway. 

&quot;Because it bubbles up sometimes. I&#39;m not going to ask everyone who just has untreated anger management either but it gets to be an itch. Or a...I don&#39;t know, an infection.&quot; This wasn&#39;t an entirely fair breakdown. Piper was limited in her experience.

Maybe that&#39;s why he&#39;d enjoyed antagonizing her, why they bickered like adolescents, like it was some kind of game as to who could be more annoying. They had something in common. The anger that made them want to lash out.

Or maybe they were both brats and that was just the way of it.

&quot;Well. I am going to guess you don&#39;t have much in the way of combat training to come out on the winning side of a fight. And I don&#39;t want to know the feasibility of the second option is for you. So.&quot;

He came to a decision, turning on his heel and motioning her to follow. &quot;Come with me. There&#39;s a place not far from here I think you might appreciate.&quot;

He led her toward the seedier side of town, a couple of blocks away from where she&#39;d found him, and went into a squat, rectangular stone building. There was an earth genasi behind a desk, bald, with marbled streaks of earthy colors running through their skin like agate, and a pair of quartz crystals growing from their head like a set of horns. &quot;Hey, Jaska,&quot; they greeted, not even batting an eye at his bloodied state, and looking at Piper and Dog curiously. &quot;Who&#39;s this?&quot;

&quot;Piper. We need to rent a room. Half an hour should suffice for now. You can put it on my tab.&quot; Before that could start to sound any more alarming, he looked to Piper. &quot;This place offers what are called rage rooms. You rent out a room - they have several kinds available, depending on the destruction you want to cause - and you are encouraged to destroy anything you like within that room.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At least the presence of her large companion might have had something to do with it. 

Piper trailed after Jaska without a second thought. She either held herself in high enough esteem to take someone who looked like a walking scarecrow or understood he could have done something during any other spat. She was absolutely silent during the trek. Until they met the genasi, nodding briefly when Jaska uttered her name. 

&quot;Hullo. And Dog. Rage rooms? You can pay but...There won&#39;t be an extra bill for anything I break?&quot; Oh, she was suspicious now. Her brows were furrowed and she kept looking between Dog and Jaska, as if the canine was going to offer some real caution in this moment.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

We buy them cheap off estate sales, secondhand stores, or get them donated, usually if they&#39;ve already got chips or cracks that make them undesirable for normal use and they would have just been thrown out anyway.&quot;

They gestured along the wall, where various protective garb was hanging in various sizes. &quot;You pick out a face shield, protective gloves and chest guards, that kind of thing. Boots, if you plan on stomping on things or kicking them. In the room itself are things you can use to break them, like clubs. If that sort of scenario isn&#39;t your style, we have rooms with punching bags you can beat the shit out of, rooms designed around chopping wood or throwing axes. Basically, it&#39;s a place you can safely vent. They&#39;re soundproofed too, so you can scream and holler and drop as many f-bombs as you like and not be judged for it.&quot;

They pulled out a slip of paper, pushing it Piper&#39;s way. &quot;I just need you to sign a liability waiver. Basically we aren&#39;t held responsible for any injuries you sustain in the act of breaking things, nor are we held responsible for harm you might do to others purposefully or accidentally.

After that she was listening to the rules carefully, and there was a clear look of anticipation in her eyes. That itch was already driving her. The last few days had just been a mix of irritation and memories fueling something more bitter and if she could just channel it some way...At least a little of it. 

As soon as the paper was in front of her she would squint and lean forward, using her pointer finger to hold her place where she needed to sign.

There isn&#39;t even a way she can think to properly thank Jaska for what she&#39;s shown her. 

The idea is even awkward to her. She is still waiting for a barb while she sauntered over to the protective eye shields.

In the room itself were several shelves full of stacks of plates, vases, trinkets, and glassware. A platform sat in the center of the room, meant for placing objects on before they were struck with one of the bats or clubs sitting in a bin next to the door. Jaska plucked a baseball bat from the bin, testing its weight, and took a glass carafe from the shelf to set it on the platform. &quot;From here on out, everything should be self explanatory. Break the breakables in whatever manner you so choose.&quot; 

He stepped back, grabbed the handle of the bat in both hands, and swung with all his lanky, borderline malnourished strength.

Since her eyesight was not the most impeccable, Piper had always preferred up close when it came to physical. There were other options, but she was mindful that she was in public. She chose a few wine glasses. Something of class. And instead of taking them to the platform, she hucked them into it like any hyper active troubled street rat might.

Piper pulled the strap over her head and let the lenses settle over her eyes. Underneath she was squinting as everything adjusted. As well as could be expected for rough fit, but details were a little clearer here.

She wanted a 3-way collision and the sound of immense chaos. At least in relation to this room and what was achievable. She wasn&#39;t the type of chaotic to intentionally shake a peaceful location. (I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d roll for this!)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Jaska&#39;s eyebrows popped up as the third projectile collided with the other two, and completely without his consent, a surprised laugh burst up from him as he watched the glorious destruction. &quot;<em>Nice,</em>&quot; he purred approvingly.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not that she was a professional, but it wasn&#39;t always luck. When all you had to work with was a shape until you were in it, you had to work fast. The next plate she lobs in silence. 

Beneath her dark vest and the short sleeves of her shirt there is a momentary glow. A soft green-blue, warm and steady lights up scrawls on parts of her exposed skin. On the backside of her right arm, maybe rib case, peeking just below her turtleneck. It isn&#39;t quite external, closer to birthmarks filled with glowstick fluid. 

As the plate nears the platform there is a clink. A detached hand gives it an extra push to the side, a firm slap before vanishing along with the glow.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I suppose someone who works with a doctor would be well-versed in the areas of the body that will hurt the most, or disable someone quickly.&quot; He flung the last of his plates and brushed his hands off on his thighs. &quot;Is there a particular reason why you don&#39;t normally wear corrective lenses?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Would I have stood a chance on the first day?&quot; 

She paused to let it land. 

&quot;But really, I&#39;m told what I have is called low vision. These are more like magnifying glass lenses. They help give a little more of an edge to shapes and that helps me with things like distance. If I&#39;m foraging I wear them, and I have a tinted pair for indoors with bright light.&quot; 

She took a deep breath after her little spiel and smiled a bit. 

&quot;I manage pretty well with Dog until I&#39;m familiar with an area but if I want to impress and maybe hit a mark I&#39;ll pull them out. I&#39;ve always wanted to try increasing the magnification but I need to tool some thicker leather to fit the lenses. It is going to look ridiculous.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
