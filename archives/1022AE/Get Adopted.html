&quot;Not... my parents. I was named by a tiefling named Marko, he raised me.&quot;

Stefan blinked at him in surprise, then grinned. &quot;That was you? We never managed to get out to visit Marko in those days, but we heard he&#39;d taken in another tiefliing.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Didn&#39;t want to be directly involved, but he could always be relied upon as a place of food and shelter if needed for a short time. Emphasis on short time. Crotchety old goat liked his solitude. Made it all the more surprising he took you in,&quot; she said with a nod to Kaleva, fetching a fourth glass that Stefan filled with milk and taking a seat at the table, gesturing for them to do the same.

She helped herself to a cookie as Stefan and Kaleva sat, Stefan happily dipping his cookie into his milk and munching on it that way. &quot;So how&#39;d you worm your way into Marko&#39;s heart?&quot;

Kaleva took the milk offered to him, sipping on it as he sort of slouched into his chair. &quot;I... It wasn&#39;t really my choice? He found me after I ran away from home. Kept me hidden until we got to his place.&quot;

&quot;Your parents didn&#39;t look for you?&quot; She was watching Kaleva keenly.

&quot;My father impregnated my mother while under a human disguise and ran off when he found out she was carrying. She didn&#39;t know what he was or what she had growing inside her.&quot; Kaleva shrugged slightly. &quot;She hid me away, didn&#39;t want me in the first place. Probably glad I was gone.&quot;

Margret&#39;s lips pursed into a thin line of displeasure. &quot;What a shallow and heartless woman. I wasn&#39;t expecting Nils to be born as he was, but from the moment I saw him I felt nothing but overwhelming love and an urge to protect him. That&#39;s how it should be for all mothers. You should never have had to suffer for her defective heart.&quot;

Kaleva sank down a little further. &quot;I don&#39;t know about defective. She was young - she didn&#39;t choose any of that.&quot;

&quot;She chose to neglect you,&quot; Margret said sternly. &quot;You, who are just as deserving of love as any child who was expected and wanted. Regardless of how ill prepared she was, how heartbroken by her lover leaving her with the result of their coupling, how confused and scared she might have been by having a tiefling child, she had no right to take that out on you. She had a choice. You did not.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Celibacy is a stupid decree,&quot; Margret said with a roll of her eyes. &quot;Sex is a completely natural act, and not a single person or animal would be alive without it.

&quot;Ah... I wondered about that for the longest time. Aasimar can fall from grace... not in the social sense, but in a physiological manner. We can be stripped of our more celestial attributes if the celestial we are tied to pushes us away. We lose contact from them. I... have met <em>so few</em> other aasimar, and despite being very research-oriented, there just isn&#39;t a lot of consistent or well-published documentation on aasimar. Partially due to the race&#39;s rarity, but also because... many aspects seem to vary from individual to individual. There is no prescribed way celestial influence takes shape in a mortal. I... <em>look</em> the way I do almost certainly because that celestial influence in me comes from a god of death and funeral practices. But the closest thing I have to a blood relative is another aasimar, the direct son of Set, with that heritage making him my uncle in a very unusual way. And he looks nothing like me. Unnaturally long, lanky limbs, eyes like lightless voids of black. But he has a warm, golden-brown complexion, and though he&#39;s built very narrow and slim, his complexion doesn&#39;t look emaciated like mine can in the wrong light. So a researcher could learn all the nuances about how my physiology is, and... more likely than not, none of that would apply to any other aasimar.&quot;

A pause as she realized she was getting long-winded and taking a long time to get to her point. The blush didn&#39;t go away. &quot;And--I guess I explain all that just to say that... What was true for me is not necessarily a truth for any aasimar. There&#39;s just... no way of knowing things like that. But... it&#39;s common for aasimar to have some manner of halo, from all I understand. My uncle does. I used to. When things got... really bad, I was...&quot; 

It hadn&#39;t just been babble before; it was easier to explain aasimar research than it was to properly elaborate on her own issues.

&quot;... Lonely, I guess. In... the deep, crushing, existential kind of way, where it consumes you entirely. I had met Kaleva in Cautica, and he had lived in that temple with me for about a year. I thought he was under my protection while he stayed there, but I... guess I thought I was someone with some degree of sway over things due to my position. And I wasn&#39;t. I was a trophy, and my keepers didn&#39;t like having a tiefling around. When attempts to convince me to send him away didn&#39;t work, I... I think the Head Priest tried to have him framed for murder. I mean... he <em>succeeded,</em> Kaleva went to trial. Which, in Cautica, should have been a death sentence for him. It would have been, but I threw myself into the middle of it and fought off the Arbiter, until the Head Priest was so alarmed by me kind of literally alighting myself in holy fire that he stepped in to negotiate having Kaleva exiled instead. And he got his way and... I went back to being alone. For ten years. I got letters from Kaleva at first, until I didn&#39;t. Which wasn&#39;t his fault, he had his own problems preventing that. So I just...&quot;

It was all just messily oozing out. It wasn&#39;t like she didn&#39;t have anyone to talk to; she would have had no hesitations about venting her traumas to the tiefling himself. But she... never really did. They had both lived it, and there wasn&#39;t much she could tell him that he didn&#39;t already know. And so much of it had trauma attached, to stir it back up would affect him, too.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1032529770715566154 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1032529770715566154><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 19, 2022 10:44 PM">10:44 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She closed her eyes, rubbing over her temple with her fingers. &quot;... The loneliness got... really bad,&quot; she concluded faintly. &quot;All I could do was try to occupy myself, but I felt no more alive than the corpses I worked upon. And I just wanted some shred of companionship. Which is... a lot of words to just say I began making necromantic minions. Rats, mostly. When the Head Priest discovered it all, I was forced to destroy everything in front of everyone else. At some point amongst all that... I lost my halo. As soon as he realized, he threw me out. And for most of the time since that happened, I&#39;ve been confused as to how what I was doing would go against Anubis&#39; will. I was careful, I didn&#39;t ever meddle with souls. Only material, no different from ferromancy or hemocraft. But the evidence seemed unwavering: I had fallen, so I must have done something to earn it.&quot;

She dropped her hand, opening her eyes again to give Margret a sheepish and tired attempt at a smile. &quot;... Anyways, it... turns out aasimar can sometimes fell themselves. Just assume they are forsaken enough that they manifest those results. It happened to my uncle, too. But Anubis never felt <em>that</em> distanced from me. He guided me, when I was thrown out, so I could reunite with Kaleva again. He never took away the magic I drew from him. Sometimes my halo comes back, too. It doesn&#39;t really stay, but Kaleva thinks it returns when I&#39;m happy, doing things I love, and being who I was meant to be. Whatever that is.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Though she had no real biological parents growing up, between Oberon and, more rarely, Anubis, Skena had at least had the influence of fatherly affection. Sure, Oberon had ruined it later on, but there was still a man who made her feel loved and protected, who held her on his lap when she was a child and taught her right from wrong.

But as Margret&#39;s arms closed around her, she found her heart suddenly swelling with an entirely unexpected surge of something bittersweet. It was a nourishment she was starved of, and having that given now was like the release of some pressure she hadn&#39;t known she carried. At the same time...

For the first time in her life, she really, <em>deeply</em> missed her birth mother. Missed the ghost of a woman she had never known. Longed for the maternal love that could have been. Mourned a vacancy whose emptiness had been so normal her whole life, it had never felt like a gaping cavity of a wound. 

Now it did.

Her jaw clenched and unclenched a few times before she could answer. &quot;... I--&quot; her voice came out cracked and weak, and she paused, swallowed, and tried again, &quot;... I tamed a couple rats that... lived around the temple garden. But they don&#39;t... live very long. And when they died... I was just... I was so tired of losing everything. My... I-I had always studied... sciences of the brain. I always had a fascination in just... wondering what information becomes... <em>physically</em> written into our brain matter. If... even after we&#39;re dead... it might be accessed again, with the right approach. Not... Not divination magic. But approached with science, and... using necromancy as the instrument. And I... I made a lot of progress. I was able to... to recover some patterns of raw instincts and reflexes. And I spent... a lot of months just refining those things. Trying to... honor the patterns that the brains suggested had been there in life. Trying to rebuild their personalities. So that when I extended some of my lifeforce into them, that energy could travel through those same patterns, the way their lifeforce had when it was still in their bodies. And it... it worked. It was rudimentary, it needed fine-tuning. But... between that and the work I had done to their bodies, rebuilding them so they were properly preserved while still being capable of natural motion... some of them looked almost indistinguishable from live rats when I was done. They moved the same way, had the same mannerisms and reflexes. And I had a lifetime of practice in preserving bodies. Even... reconstructing the anatomy of the deceased, if their loved ones objected to sending them to the afterlife heavily marred. It was... almost like being able to get back what I had lost,&quot; she mumbled quietly. &quot;It almost made me happy.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There was a faint noise as Stefan rose from his chair, and he jumped slightly at the gentle touch to his shoulder, looking up as Stefan motioned his head for him to follow. Wordlessly he set down his empty glass and rose to follow Stefan into the other room, to the living area where the elderly man kept his books and various keepsakes.

As the men excused themselves, Margret continued to slowly rock Skena, gnarled fingers combing through her hair in soothing motions. &quot;It makes me curious how much the magic must differ from what was done with Nils and Eidunn,&quot; she murmured. &quot;But what of the rats themselves? Did they have names, personalities? Did you have any favorites?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At Margret&#39;s question, she swallowed hard. <em>Of course they did.</em> But... those were details that had only ever really seemed to matter to her.

&quot;... I named the first one Muffin,&quot; she squeaked after a moment. &quot;They had been her favorite snack, and... she was the color of the ones we had in the kitchens at the time. It was... really hard to earn her trust. But once I did, I... I just... I couldn&#39;t help but feel like... I don&#39;t know. There was this wisdom to her. She had such intelligent eyes. I had worked so hard to try to recreate that face when she died. The way her eyes, even though they were... just little beady black eyes... they seemed so understanding. Maybe it was just... how deeply desperate I was for companionship. But I really did love her. She came to see me before she went off to die, and she took a nap on my lap. For such a deeply prey-minded animal to trust me enough to fall asleep on me like that meant the world to me, but... the next time I saw her, she was dead under a bush.&quot; She swallowed again. Her throat felt so dry.

&quot;She was... the most crude of the minions. I was... still learning. And it never quite felt like I got her eyes to look how they used to. But... I liked having her on my shoulder while I worked on the others. When the others were alive, they groomed her and played with her like she was, too. Even if... it wasn&#39;t the same as her being alive to me, it felt good that they could experience having their friend back, too.&quot;

A pause. &quot;... After Muffin came Strudel and &#201;clair. They mostly looked like Muffin... there aren&#39;t a lot of genetic morphs to coat patterns in wild rats... but Strudel had three white socks, and &#201;clair only had one.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She was quiet for a moment, then admitted, &quot;Necromancy has a lot of bad associations with it, and I have long held some aversion toward it. But without necromancy, my children would not have gotten a second chance. And I see them now, still full of love and a desire to live, and I am happy for them, and happy for myself and Stefan, to be able to see them and love them again before we pass on. Yours is a different kind, it seems, because you don&#39;t &#39;meddle with souls,&#39; as you&#39;ve said. You treat what you animate with respect. It doesn&#39;t seem a perversion, the way you describe it. You don&#39;t animate for power, but for companionship.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
