While Axa coming down with a cold wasn&#39;t ideal, there was at least an abundance of fruits available that he could keep her supplied with vitamins to try to fight off the sickness. A guide was found and spores and seedlings were harvested to bring back, along with a dozen respiratory masks. Returning to less humid and sweaty environs was a relief, and Jaska promptly met with Hiraeth, finding the other tiefling to his liking. A site had been selected to build a greenhouse in, out in the woods outside of town, and Hiraeth had actually offered to grow the place to better conceal it and to save on time and materials. All they needed was panes of glass to purchase.

Such a project would take a few days for Hiraeth to complete, which was fine. While Hiraeth worked on that, Jaska took the opportunity to rest back at Valentine&#39;s, and was napping on her couch.

Unfortunately, his rest didn&#39;t wind up being as restful as he thought. While he slept, his eyelids fluttered, lips twitching and pulling into a grimace. His breathing became oddly staggered, stopping entirely for an unnatural length of time, and then being sharply sucked in  and huffed out in muffled almost-coughs.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But Jaska’s hitched and sometimes nonexistent breathing was cause for concern.

The second time it happened, she stood up from where she had been settled, moving over to the couch and lowering to a kneel beside where he was resting. Reaching out a hand, she found his shoulder, and gave it a gentle, soft rub to try to stir him to waking without startling him.

“Jaska, dear,” she whispered softly, “you’re not breathing right…”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was only then he started to take in his surroundings, the realization that there was no water filling his lungs, that he was dry, that this wasn&#39;t the hospital. His arms shook as he held his body up off the floor, and he slowly turned his head to look toward the doctor - no, toward Valentine.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He reached for the arm of the chair and pulled himself to his feet, stepping over to grasp her arm and help her back to her feet - though he didn&#39;t release her right away, taking hold of her chin in his other hand, tipping her head slightly to examine the marks he&#39;d left behind, the half-moon cuts his nails had left. &quot;Go see Skena tomorrow if you have difficulty breathing or swallowing.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A good bit of what she had told Luka to reassure him of Jaska&#39;s character was unfounded beyond her just <em>feeling</em> she knew what was what. It was nice to have a little bit of tangible reassurance that her assumptions were right, and that in his own way, some part of him did care about her. In some capacity.

&quot;I&#39;ve endured far worse,&quot; she murmured back easily, drifting away when he did finally release her to go make his drink. &quot;I&#39;m hardier than even my own brothers give me credit for. But I&#39;m not too proud to call for healing if it becomes necessary.&quot; Seeming perfectly unfazed, she began pulling forth some bottles from her cabinets.

As she did so, a little, pale shape crept forward. Axa had fallen asleep on top of the bookcase again, but had easily woken up amidst the brief surge of chaos, and now inched cautiously forward towards Jaska, wide but seemingly blank eyes searching his face for some sort of understanding to what had just transpired.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He turned his attention to Axa as she approached, and stooped down to lift her up onto his hip, walking into the kitchen to sit down at the table and adjust her into his lap. &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; he reassured her. &quot;Sometimes I remember things in my dreams, and it&#39;s difficult to shake off those memories if I am abruptly awakened.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Val didn&#39;t take long to make the drink, returning to the table a short while later to slide it towards Jaska, and settle down to sit opposite him. She was quiet for a while, before murmuring, &quot;... If you&#39;re willing, and it would not be to your detriment...

I didn&#39;t know we were going to the hospital until we were there, and I heard him explain our situation to the doctors, his desire to be voluntarily committed and treated, and signing away his rights to release himself until the doctors either determined there was nothing more they could do, or his condition was cured. Because of course they did not want me signing us out.&quot;

Jaska set aside the drink, sitting back in his chair, one hand cupped at the back of Axa&#39;s head. &quot;I could practically hear the jail cell slamming shut. Except prison would have been a mercy compared to that cold, sterile whiteness. Every procedure they planned to do to exterminate me, they ran through Luka first. And I heard him not only agree, but offer suggestions as to the best ways to force my appearance. I heard them talk in explicit detail what they were going to do to me.

The tone of his voice was deadened, in the sort of calm distance that came from speaking of words that had carved themselves into your soul.

&quot;Regardless of whether I was truly a separate entity or a fractured part of his psyche. And if it was the latter, it was nothing he wanted reabsorbed. He likened me to a cancer, better to be cut out than to be allowed any more control over his body.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

First under anesthesia, which neither of us remember, and did nothing but leave us confused and disoriented and with some short term memory loss. Then later, without anesthesia, after forcing me into control. They had to heal a number of cracked and broken teeth over the weeks of repeated attempts.&quot;

He tongued the inside of his cheek, clicked slightly, and continued. &quot;They were mostly disorienting. Often times my speech afterward was... garbled, nonsense words, or didn&#39;t make sense. It varied whether or not all my muscles were locked up and rigid, or just... rag dolled, unable to even lift my head, drooling like a faucet and covered in a cold sweat. Automatisms... Repeated motions I had no control over. Sometimes I lost control over my bladder or bowels. Or vomited. There were odd sensations, too... Flashing lights. Odd smells, like burning rubber, the taste of metal on my tongue. The headaches were monstrous. But they never did anything to comfort or soothe while I was in control. Only when Luka was there did they comfort and offer medicine and healing to relieve the symptoms.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;At a bare minimum, these <em>professionals</em> should be relieved of their positions of power. The claim that they tortured you isn&#39;t an opinion or a perspective.

Two more taps of her fingernail. And then she let out another sigh, this one seemingly an attempt to release a growing accumulation of nasty emotions. &quot;...

But it only took her a few seconds to swallow that agitation and return to her more typical demeanor, her posture slowly easing again. Where that agitation went, who could say. 

&quot;... Laracus... It sounds more and more like such a miserable place.

He let out a derisive noise. &quot;They had to sit Luka down and explain to him why what had taken place was wrong and unethical, why it wouldn&#39;t continue. It was like trying to convince a Stockholm&#39;s victim to give up on their captor.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;... Luka is... he&#39;s naive. It doesn&#39;t surprise me he would have put so much blind faith in them that it would take considerable effort to pry him out of that mindset, that they were helping him somehow.&quot; She shook her head.

&quot;... With your permission, I think I&#39;d like to do some digging, just to see if I can uncovering information about this facility. Perhaps understanding of what this said change was. I won&#39;t take any action, I&#39;m just... curious. I want to look into the establishment. Even if there was a change of management that had them revising cruel practices... you--and Luka--would both be owed something, I would think. Compensation. In the absence of that, I wonder if the new management, while seemingly more altruistic, is covering their own asses and trying to bury records or information. Luka would never think to demand reparations of any sort, but... you were both tortured. You more than him, but <em>tortured</em>. I think they should die for it--but even outside of that, freeing you with merely a pat on the ass and a little apology is horrid in terms of running a business.&quot; Val squinted a little, shaking her head again.

&quot;There&#39;s something unseen going on in all that mess, and I&#39;d like to know what it is. If nothing else, just for the sake of knowing.&quot; She had absolutely meant what she said when she vowed to respect his consent, but all the same, it was clear she was chomping at the bit for <em>something</em>. 

She was a protector of her brothers--whether Jaska liked or wanted that or not, it was the way her love manifested the most. And the more she knew, the more it was beginning to haunt her that she hadn&#39;t protected them from something this insidious. She wasn&#39;t used to dealing with such a skin-crawling regret, and in the absence of being able to turn back time, she was just... reaching, blindly groping for anything to grab onto that could <em>maybe</em> retroactively fix what had gone awry. A lawsuit, a mass murder, blackmail...

She didn&#39;t know what else to do. But to simply nod along to Jaska&#39;s memories and pat his back and tell him she was sorry he got hurt and then carry on as normal did not feel like an option.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Axa was still awake, eyeing her aunt across the table as Jaska pet her hair. But she was listening, though she gave absolutely no outward show of it. 

Her psychosomatic illness on their journey south had only really begun to subside once they were back home, and her stress levels consequentially eased back. But if nothing else, the trip had proven that, unlike most three year olds with a cold, she was perfectly capable of staying entirely out of the way, even when thoroughly miserable. The circumstantial necessity to expand their diets to more exotic options had also helped patterns in her willingness (and lack thereof) for eating certain foods to begin to shine through a bit more clearly. There was at least one proven rule of thumb by now, and it was that she consistently and unyieldingly turned her nose up at white foods, especially ones that were naturally moist or runny. 

But back home, she was slowly recovering from her quiet misery, at least enough to be able to follow along with the conversation. As the adults&#39; voices drifted off, she stirred slightly, though only to lift her head and glance up towards Jaska&#39;s face wordlessly. Hearing people divulge horrible things that had happened to them was a wild concept for her, and she was trying to make sense of it and what purpose it served.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;There was documentation of everything they did,&quot; he finally offered with a sigh. &quot;I&#39;d see them writing it down. No idea if those documents still exist. But you know about the forced drowning. They tried various drugs. Magics designed to rape the mind. Occasionally someone would try to talk to me for some psychoanalysis, but I said nothing, gave them nothing they didn&#39;t rip from my mind by force.&quot; Jaska reached for the empty glass as if to take another drink, halfway lifted it to his lips before remembering it was empty, and set it down again.

&quot;Three years. Or, nearly that. I lost sense of time while I was there. But the first time I took control after Luka left that accursed hospital...

I suppose if I was in his position, having done what he did, I would want to be aware of your perspective, too. I can&#39;t say what would come of it, but... if nothing else... I think he deserves to understand the depth of the consequences of his actions. But again... I won&#39;t meddle if it would upset you.&quot;

Axa had readjusted her position so she could rest against him while keeping her gaze on him, studying his features as he spoke. As per usual, there was no indication on her own face as to what his words meant to her, the lack of a reaction potentially being her neurodivergence--or, just as easily, being an unnatural desensitization to the subject matter.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Knowing Luka the way he did, this sort of knowledge would tear his brother apart. Luka knew what he did, what he allowed to happen, but he couldn&#39;t understand it from Jaska&#39;s perspective. Luka had always thought of him as unfeeling and heartless, made up of nothing but cruelty and vice. He&#39;d started to learn otherwise since Axa came into the picture, but...

A slow, dark smile curled Jaska&#39;s lips as he stared off at nothing, his cat-like eye seeming to burn from within, a subtle glow darkening the shadow beneath that eye. &quot;He does deserve to understand.

She drew in a slow, deep breath, before nodding again. &quot;I&#39;ll figure it out,&quot; she replied after a pause. There was a way to do this cleanly, where Luka was <em>not</em> torn apart, but Jaska&#39;s experience was still validated. She didn&#39;t know what that was yet, but she wasn&#39;t interested in taking such action with blatant disregard for Luka&#39;s sanity. 

The pendulum needed to settle at its apex, not overcorrect by swinging to the opposite extreme.

Poor Axa was having a very hard time following along. She understood the words, but the emotions attached to them? Jaska looked miserable one moment, and--now he was smiling? 

Valentine&#39;s offer must have pleased him. So he was... happy now. That seemed to be the indication.

&quot;If it makes you feel better,&quot; she said, a slight dryness to her tone gently seeming to imply that she knew the <em>feeling better</em> she was referring to was not one of healing, but sadism, &quot;We spoke the other day, and he seemed to be beginning to wrap his head around the reality of things. That seed is already planted, as he sees you more and more getting your feet under you, and showing signs of not just being a raging psychopath, but a person with a full spectrum of emotions that he can empathize with. I think even now, without a deeper conversation about it, he&#39;s horrified of what he&#39;s realizing he did.&quot;

She sighed again, resting an elbow on the table with that hand rubbing slightly at her eyes. &quot;I love him dearly. But he&#39;s too soft for this world. It was where the trouble began with Rhatihl, and it apparently allows anyone with the right approach to influence him drastically. I&#39;m glad he&#39;s here in town, now, where I feel better about my ability to keep tabs on whatever messes he may end up in. I wish I knew how to temper his heart so he wasn&#39;t so susceptible to being taken advantage of without destroying him.&quot; She waved a hand dismissively. &quot;I know <em>you</em> don&#39;t care about those things. But I do. He&#39;s a well-meaning but soft little fool.&quot; <em>Snort</em>.

&quot;The exact opposite of yourself: a jaded knot of scar tissue with veins of gold and compassion buried deep beneath. And what in the world does that make me, I wonder.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Axa&#39;s gaze dropped from his face as Jaska turned his attention towards her, but she didn&#39;t shy away from him. There was a slight note of something restless in her demeanor, but like any of her emotions, it was subtle and hard to pin down precisely.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Val’s expression had also softened as she listened to the little scratchy noises of the pencil. “Are those the coloring supplies Luka gave her?” She asked softly. “I thought for sure she was uninterested in them.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Axa didn’t seem to pay their conversation any mind. Her scratchy scribbling was slow, and for a while, seemed to just be her trying to get the hang of the required motor skills, her lines graceless and—well, what would be expected from a child her age. 

But then she seemed to reach a point where she simply gave up, instead planting her hands on either side of the paper to steady it as her telekinesis took hold of the pencil instead. There was a shorter experimental period this time, as the pencil seemed to move much more fluidly and… almost oddly skillfully. Once she seemed to have the hang of it, she hunched forward slightly over the paper, setting to work on… something.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“I was worried you’d be just a carbon copy of Luka’s body. And what an insult that would have felt like. But no… you look a part of the family, and still distinctly your own person, as you were always meant to be. Though it’s a shame I didn’t get to see your hair before you cut it. Mine and Luka’s have so many colors in it, I’ve wondered what colors you might have lopped off. Though I do think the matter of muscles is something that makes sense; you also didn’t manifest the body of someone who had accumulated much body fat. Fat and muscle, it makes sense you’d start without either accrued much.”

Through Jaska’s eyes, she really wasn’t terribly interested in her own appearance. She paid much more attention to Jaska’s glances at Axa and what she was up to, not usually one to be privy to the sight of art, a child’s or not.

Though the longer Axa drew, the less childish her scribbles looked. It was fair to assume she had never seen other children drawing, and so her approach looked nothing like the typical blob or stick figures and incomprehensible scrawling masses. Instead, she was still scribbling… but it was controlled and purposeful. Seemingly chaotic at first, but gradually building up values, shadows and highlights, shapes becoming defined on the page. The longer she scribbled, the more the scribbles tightened up into finer and finer details. It wasn’t exactly photorealism, but the image she was creating was starkly unusual for a three—or even seven—year old child to produce. 

And as features became more tangible, the vision she was depicting became more and more horrific. Some sort of creature—likely not a humanoid, yet possessing vaguely human features. A bulbous, saggy form that almost looked to be melting off itself, with bulky and warped limbs covered in odd details that could have been veins, or tears, or ridges, or even gaping expanses missing flesh from them. Odd bumps covered the presumed body like tumors or pustules, and the face looked like… almost like the face of a man. But a man who had been stretched and melted and permanently mangled into an expression of mindless agony.

Lemures are fiends at the bottom of Hell’s totem pole, just gross abominations of what used to be a person, now reduced to its most base impulses and cravings.</code></span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/928137595932786719/928539182035505202/IMG_9322.jpg?ex=65965380&amp;is=6583de80&amp;hm=5ea8582449ce588f3176e746ec2c88f11d67947a60d0cf8d6c14b2967bcbc284&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/928137595932786719/928539182035505202/IMG_9322.jpg?ex=65965380&amp;is=6583de80&amp;hm=5ea8582449ce588f3176e746ec2c88f11d67947a60d0cf8d6c14b2967bcbc284&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: IMG_9322.jpg (122.22 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

You can see traces of the violet in my hair yet...&quot;

He trailed off as he began to pay more attention to Axa&#39;s drawing, watching the levitating pencil scribbling out some truly impressive artwork. It didn&#39;t take long for him to identify it either, murmuring, &quot;Oh... She&#39;s drawing a lemure, if I&#39;m not mistaken.

I wonder what’s brought about the sudden muse.”

Eventually, the scribbling stopped. The red pencil was lowered aside, and the black pencil lifted itself up instead. It’s contribution was smaller and simpler: a single shape, tangled up in what was likely the lemure’s claws. This was… harder to make sense of, as it was a long but narrow shape that extended to the edge of the page facing Axa. But the more she worked on it, the more it looked like it might have been a digitigrade leg, an implied body presumably off the edge of the page. And if that assessment was correct… then this drawing was not a simple frontal view of a lemure. It was a point-of-view depiction of a lemure latched on to the viewer’s leg.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His head tipped just slightly. &quot;But that is no longer the case. Were anything to try and hurt you now, I would fight by your side in an instant.

Val watched quietly through Jaska’s eyes, her own expression softened in gentle compassion. “Is this creature the cause of the wounds you had when we first met?” She asked softly.

Axa gave a little shake of her head. Then, after an awkward and indecisive pause where she tried to find her voice, she echoed one simple word Jaska had said earlier. “Rape.”

Val was instantly silenced, her eyes widening slightly.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Suddenly, the memory of the foul, greasy haired man in the Stray Coin came to mind, and though that man had technically done nothing to Axa himself, Jaska knew in that moment his time was coming to an end. Soon.

Such filth would not be allowed to exist around his daughter.

Val sighed softly, tempering her reaction to ensure she didn’t express her shock and quiet horror in a way that was jarring for Axa. “… Sometimes, you almost forget it was <em>Hell</em> she was in,” she murmured faintly, half to herself.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“In the meantime, she should be alright,” she added gently. “Everyone assumes her a tiefling, and tieflings are native to this plane; even if someone sought to get rid of her, banishment is likely not where one’s mind would go.

Axa&#39;s tail curled to dab the bead of venom against her pant leg, soaking it off and effectively wiping the barb dry, before relaxing her tail to let the barb all but disappear again. So she now had venom of an unknown potency soaked into a random spot of her clothes, but that at least probably meant it wasn&#39;t dangerous unless injected or ingested...?

Val had also studied the surprise anatomy with quiet interest, a soft smile on her face. &quot;I wonder if there are tieflings with similar features. Apparently our tails come in all shapes and sizes and varieties, but specifically to produce venom... <em>that</em> would be a unique mutation. One I haven&#39;t heard of before.

&quot;By all accounts, he is an upstanding, law-abiding citizen.

&quot;He smelled like dog <em>before</em> he got a dog. All the time. Every single time he came into the bar, no matter time of day or how long he&#39;d been in town.

They talked at length about magic, and the things she shared about her own abilities had Wesley absolutely enamored, and he began encouraging her to pursue some sort of academic glory. She balked considerably, talking about how she had been put on a pedestal before--had spent her entire life on a pedestal, by the sound of it--and had no desire to return to that sort of status. When she realized the conversation was catching the attention of others beyond her intended companion, she panicked a bit and fled very suddenly. She&#39;s a meek creature, but I haven&#39;t heard her so miserable as she was explaining the life she had once lived.&quot;

Axa&#39;s black scribbles began to take on a vague, hulking shape, potentially humanoid. But... potentially not. The presumed face of the creature she was illustrating was not that of a person, but something long, with a muzzle.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I can&#39;t say. As is evident by his own unspoken affiliation, they keep their business under the table, but I&#39;ve picked up enough to piece together that he&#39;s not the only of that kind in this town.

Using his secret as leverage is all good and well--but I would <em>strongly</em> advise against <em>acting</em> on any threats, or twisting his arm <em>too</em> sharply, lest his allies rise up against you, and we learn exactly how many werewolves are in Fielbarry due to them all trying to wipe you off the census for threatening their collective wellbeing.&quot;

She slowly sat back again, reveling in the taste of fresh tea even as the excitement of her conclusion died down. &quot;You come before them in my mind, and you always will. But they <em>are</em> good kids, from all I can tell, and I don&#39;t wish them harm. Unless and until they present a threat to you, Axa, or any other aspect of our family... but I strongly suspect that conflict will never come to pass. Mm... I&#39;d be fiercely curious to know whatever you might uncover about the remaining secrets floating around those two. The lycanthropy explains much about Kaleva, but... not everything.

Turning, she moved back to the coat rack, finding a garment of her own there and feeling for the pockets, then rummaging within. &quot;I had something made that will be useful for you.

Well, this is hard to do blind.&quot; Giving up almost immediately, she held the handful out towards him.

&quot;They should all be golden bands; one has a citrine gem on it, one has a ruby, and one has amethyst. Find the ruby one and take that one.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I can communicate telepathically at will, as you know, but I have to be the one to start the conversation. If you press the gem on yours, it will give a little sensation on mine, and I can take that as an indication to reach out to you and open that communication if there&#39;s something you need to reach me about.
