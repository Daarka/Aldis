Like the patch on his upper arm after Cairn had given him that hearty slap.

He didn&#39;t often look this bad. If anything, he looked worse than that first night Skena had originally healed him by pouring her own life&#39;s energy into him to supplement his own. His skin had a bloodless, yellowish tinge to it, and his eyes were visibly glazed over. The smell was... pretty awful too. But that was nothing in comparison to just how revolting his rotting body felt.

Automatically he started to head toward the guild hall, but hesitated as Skena started heading elsewhere. &quot;...Did you move?&quot; he inquired as he followed after her.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Granted, she wasn’t actively rotting like Jaska, but there was an <em>ugly</em> mark of blackened, necrotic flesh around where the hag had grabbed her throat that, no doubt, did not feel good. Her life was no longer in danger thanks to the healing she had received, but it still looked painful. 

Likely to Jaska’s mild horror, she led him towards Finders Keepers, pushing inside and making her way past the shop front and directly into the heart of Ingrid and Arsast’s home.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But he followed her in, rather hoping he would be lucky enough to avoid being seen by Ingrid. Or Arsast for that matter. He really did not want to have to explain why he was rotting.

Speaking of rot. There was an audible sort of gurgle in his belly, the churning of building gas from the decomposition. He turned his head away to belch into his sleeve, and the <em>taste</em> that came up with it had him letting out a sudden, coughing retch. His expression was one of horrified disgust, and he kept his sleeve up in front of his mouth, his severe features pinched.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ingrid is an old friend of Kaleva’s, and they agreed to let us use their home as a doorway to our own.”

Picking through the living space, she came to a door in the wall. It didn’t exactly stick out like a sore thumb, but it certainly didn’t match the stylings of any of the rest of the fey kids’ home—and Jaska would have no memory of it being there previously. Without hesitating, Skena turned the handle and made her way through this entryway, holding the door open to allow Jaska to follow before shutting it behind them.

They stepped into a small room, bare of everything—except for a golden bowl sitting on the floor off to the side, filled with… what looked like blood? With a bloodied paintbrush alongside it. Opposite them was another door, which Skena moved towards and pushed open, leading them into a much larger living area. 

It looked nothing like Finders Keepers. And judging by the view out of the large archway that seemed to open up directly into a forest, they probably weren’t even still in Fielbarry proper. 

“Make yourself comfortable,” she offered softly, shutting the second door behind them—and revealing that on the outward facing side, it looked to be nothing more than an inconspicuous bookcase.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, March 19, 2022 8:59 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Probably fortunately for Jaska, Kaleva and Atreyu were out - Kaleva having taken the hound to the swamps near where Skena was set up just in case he&#39;d been needed, as promised.

Atreyu would have probably flattened Jaska to the floor and rolled all over him.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; he replied absently, looking around and taking a seat on the couch in front of the fireplace. Unbuttoning his waistcoat and setting it aside, he untucked his shirt and unbuttoned it next, knowing that Skena would likely need access to the patch of skin that Cairn had unknowingly sloughed off his upper arm.

&quot;That hag did a number on you as well. Are you going to be able to tend to the both of us tonight?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Moving over to where Jaska was seated, she tossed back the potion, taking a moment to settle herself and try to regain her own stability as the healing set in. The ugly black mark only lessened slightly, though. 

“… Thank you for intervening when you did,” she murmured after a moment, setting aside the emptied bottle and sitting next to him to look over his arm as he removed his shirt. “I know necrotic magic when I feel it… and I suppose it makes sense that such attacks would be so devastating on you.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As she worked, she reached out with her consciousness to find the glimmer of Kaleva’s mind somewhere out in the world.

While Skena worked on his arm, Jaska leaned forward slightly to prop his elbow of his free arm on his knee, gingerly massaging the bridge of his nose, his eyes closed. He muttered lowly, &quot;There are times I resent this body. For all I am grateful to have it in the first place, the fact that I can&#39;t generate my own life force is a serious drawback.

She… didn’t have the capacity to cast sending again. Not if she wanted to heal Jaska. 

Hopefully he wouldn’t worry too badly on his way home.

Refocusing on Jaska’s words, she frowned sympathetically. “… I wish I knew a more permanent solution for you. I’ve wracked my mind for one many times. The closest approximation I’ve been able to figure has been if you somehow obtained some sort of… external store of lifeforce. Something you could draw from as needed instead of needing me.” She sighed, and added, “Don’t get me wrong, I’m happy to help. It’s no burden to me. But I can understand that it’s not ideal for you. Still, I… have no idea what kind of device would grant such a utility. That’s where my musings have always hit a dead end. I wouldn’t know how to ‘fill’ such a thing with lifeforce, either. Short of someone like me doing something like we already do.”

And speaking of how unpleasant necrotic damage felt… she took a deep breath as she concluded her mending, and the golden light began to stir up more in earnest. As was routine for them now, lifeforce poured into Jaska—as it simultaneously drained from Skena, ravaging her already necrotic wounds and exacerbating the nasty black patches once more that had been slightly lessened by the healing potion. 

This time, she couldn’t help but grunt softly in pain, though she was unflinching in seeing the magic through to fruition. As the golden glow faded again, Jaska was left just about good as new. Skena slumped back against the couch, on the other hand, biting back a quiet groan and trying to relax again after the spike of nauseating pain. 

She was almost completely tapped, having already pushed most of her capacity for spellcasting earlier in the day. So there was no follow up this time of her healing her own wounds. It looked like they were here to stay for the time being.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Jaska looked to Skena after the healing completed, waiting for her to then heal herself... But it became apparent after a few moments that she was spent.

And... something in him gentled, at that. Knowing that she would have nothing left for herself, she gave all that she had to see him whole again, and would spend the rest of the day suffering that same agony until she had rested enough to replenish her magic.

The sounds of forest creatures in this place came as zero surprise, and he found his thoughts rather muzzy, chalking it up to simple exhaustion.

“That’ll come in handy if you ever encounter some sort of… rogue angel,” she commented absentmindedly, not realizing how close she herself was to being under that label.

The question didn&#39;t seem to require an answer though as he continued on. &quot;I suppose I can appreciate that.

Had even begun to do so, when the sudden sound of large paws thumping on the ground approached at a fast pace, followed by the scuff of a quick stop.

Jerking upright, Jaska instinctively reached for his dagger, but settled when it was Kaleva who walked quickly through the door and beelined it for Skena, kneeling down and looking over her injuries with a frown.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But she remembered the gentle, loving talk she had with Kaleva, and his words about how labels were largely for the benefit of others, and the importance of correcting Jaska gradually melted away. The look of being mildly blindsided faded from her expression, replaced with simple acceptance, and she slogged through her thoughts to belatedly respond.

&quot;There was a weird hag. I&#39;ve not heard of them before as having, like... well. Nothing about it was typical. It had a lot of limbs and... just... bones. All moving around kind of freely inside the skin. I think it saw me heal someone and focused on me instead. It was... a lot of necrotic magic that it did... Jaska killed it before it got too carried away with me, though. Kaleva I think there&#39;s a deer loose in the house somewhere.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He quickly made his way out of Ingrid&#39;s storefront and to the guild hall, straight for Altaira to get pointed toward the nearest healer. After getting directions to Cass&#39; residence, he set off at a jog, trying to jostle Skena as little as possible as he made his way to the outskirts of the city and the little cottage attached to the closed-off greenhouse, using his boot to kick at the door several times in an imitation of a knock. 

Hiraeth had been deeply involved in a book when the frantic pounding startled him into motion, reaching for his staff to hobble to the door. &quot;I&#39;m coming, just a moment...!&quot;

He blinked when he opened the door to find an unfamiliar tiefling with a very stinky not quite dead corpse in his arms. &quot;Ah... hello, wha-&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m looking for Cassiana, Altaira directed me here. Is she here?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As Kaleva announced the reason for his visit, there was a low, unbothered voice that stirred up from behind Hiraeth. &quot;<em>Ohh</em>, a visitor for me?&quot; Cassiana sounded wholly lackadaisical as she limped her way towards the door as well, looking only marginally more alive than Skena herself. But at least this healer had no visible wounds.

She leaned on her staff as she came to a halt, a curious but rather sleepy gaze looking over the two strangers. &quot;And what has Altaira seemingly tasked me with, then?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Hiraeth opened the door wide to allow them in, gesturing them into the tiny cottage. There wasn&#39;t much to it. Two chairs by the fireplace, a little kitchen with a small table to eat at, some shelves on the walls that held various crystals and bones and carved trinkets, a single bookcase, and a single-sized bed clearly built for one. It was built like a studio, with the bathroom being the only place that had its own separate room.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Ah. I can take a look, certainly. Pleasure to meet you both.&quot;

Skena was not very accustomed to being on this side of the emergency healer visit. In fact, the last time she&#39;d had healers working on <em>her</em>, she had just almost scorched herself to death in a coliseum...

&quot;I-I think I&#39;m--probably? fine, I just... I transferred lifeforce to a friend who was in worse shape, and it made my wounds worse, but it&#39;s something I do for him a lot so that&#39;s not unusual.&quot; Her voice was even more soft and meek than usual, perhaps a touch of rather uncharacteristic nervousness suddenly bouncing around inside her tiny frame. &quot;I thought there were wild animals that got into our house, though, but Kaleva made sure there weren&#39;t. But I heard them, clear as day.&quot;

Cass listened without offering much in the way of reaction, almost seeming like she wasn&#39;t properly processing the details with how little she was acknowledging. But as Skena slowly drifted off, she nodded, nonplussed. 

&quot;A hag, you said?&quot;

Skena nodded slowly. 

Cassiana&#39;s smoke hand lifted, the forefinger of the shape hooking in Skena&#39;s collar to pull the fabric back, her glassy eyes appraising the sickly black necrotic wounds. Specifically the shape they took; a bite mark. 

&quot;Mm.&quot; Her ethereal touch fell away again--and then gave a flicking gesture, as if to fling water off the tips of her nonexistent fingers. There was no water, but the gesture did fling more of that same smoky substance directly into Skena&#39;s face, causing the smaller cleric to jolt just slightly despite there being a lack of physical impact. The smoke then settled into the open wounds, seeming to drain directly into her body, until the next breath Skena took let out that smoke on the exhale. 

But as that breath billowed out, Skena blinked hard several times. It was like all the fog clouding her mind bled out with that breath, her thoughts clearing up pristinely in just a matter of seconds. &quot;... That... feels much better. Thank you.&quot;

&quot;Then you were afflicted with Witch&#39;s Delirium,&quot; Cassiana replied evenly, leaning back on her staff again. &quot;A disease that lies dormant within some hags. The symptoms are inconvenient, but not life threatening. Nor are your injuries.&quot;

Where Skena had bled herself dry healing Jaska beyond the point of necessity, it appeared Cassiana was a different breed of cleric. She was not exactly cold, but her bedside manner was... pragmatic. Free of emotion. Friendly, patient... but for someone like Kaleva, who only really knew a healer like Skena, there was a <em>starkly</em> noticeable lack of martyrdom.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He finally let Skena stand on her own again, easing her down onto her own two feet, slowly enough that she would become aware of what he was doing as he was doing it. &quot;That&#39;s good to know. Thank you.&quot;

During all this, Hiraeth had moved aside, limping back to his chair to ease himself back in it. He sat so close to the fireplace that the tip of his tail actually rested in it, and the flaming tip had become unable to be distinguished from the rest of it, so it... actually looked like his tail had caught on fire. But it certainly didn&#39;t seem to be bothering him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A hand, still slightly rotten around the edges, reached to hold his, her other hand still managing to hold onto the cup of tea as she looked back to Cassiana. &quot;Yes, thank you. I should be able to handle everything else myself once I&#39;m rested.&quot; A beat. Her brows furrowed slightly. 

&quot;How is the disease spread?&quot;

Cass quirked a brow ever so slightly. &quot;Bite wounds from the hag, predominantly.&quot;

&quot;Hm. I&#39;m not the only one she bit,&quot; Skena murmured softly. &quot;I&#39;ll keep an ear out for other hunters with similar symptoms.&quot; Another pause. &quot;... Come to think of it, I believe Jaska was bit, too...&quot;

That seemed to tickle Cass&#39; intrigue ever so slightly, but she made no comment, despite the obvious recognition of the name.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;We have our happy ending, Kaleva. If it&#39;s not happy, its not the end yet. Anubis wouldn&#39;t take me away from you like this. I just... I don&#39;t know. I...&quot; She drifted off a moment, trying to find her words. 

&quot;... It&#39;s not like I&#39;ve had long conversations with Him. But... He&#39;s... He&#39;s in my veins. In my dreams. A part of me just... innately understands who He is. He&#39;s a god of death, but... He doesn&#39;t <em>seek</em> the demise of living things. Death comes for everything in time. There&#39;s no need to rush it. He wants us to live our lives fully... and when we finally come home to Him, He wants to welcome us and comfort us and ease us to rest. His purpose isn&#39;t to cause death, it&#39;s to be the god that welcomes us home on the other side of the veil. And... knowing what I know about His domain... knowing how intimately He&#39;s woven His will into our lives... it would feel starkly out of character and against all the mannerisms I know of from Him for Him to snuff me out. When I&#39;m barely thirty years old. When we only just now truly found happiness.&quot;

She drew in a deep breath--pausing only when doing so reached a point where it became painful--and let out a long sigh. &quot;I&#39;m not suggesting either of us are invulnerable. We should still be wise, and stay safe where necessary. But I just... with every day that goes by, I feel more and more like <em>this</em> is the life I was meant to be living all along. One that serves Him even better than being the Daughter of Divinity in a temple of His name. More and more, I feel like we put distance between ourselves and the pain in our pasts. I&#39;m starting to just... <em>begin</em> to feel like maybe that pain isn&#39;t coming back. Never like how it was before. New trials, maybe. But never that pain that almost destroyed us both.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Relax,&quot; she murmured, glancing up towards the shrine as she took a deep breath.

&quot;So assuming this works... it&#39;s not the same and you and I talking now. It&#39;s not even the same as if I asked you a question. The magic opens communication to my god, but strictly within the confines of me asking a question about something that will occur within the next seven days--and then my god&#39;s answer. So if I want to ask more... existential sorts of questions, I have to be a bit creative with my phrasing for it to work.&quot;

She placed a hand over the mummified cat--which was only barely recognizable as the shape of a cat, swaddled as it was in burial linens and coated in resin. Her other hand slid to the side, finding Kaleva&#39;s, and gently closing over his fingers. In effect, dragging him into the center of the spellcasting with her.

Her eyes closed, and golden light began to bleed out from beneath her hand, over the mummified corpse. That light bloomed brighter and brighter, until it had consumed the entire shape--and then particles of that glowing shape began to break away, drifting through the air and blinking out like showers of embers. Yet taking mass with them as they flitted away, until, in a matter of seconds, the entire mummy had evaporated in the form of glowing particulates. 

When her hand hovered over nothing at all, she opened her eyes again, expression warming slightly in quiet excitement; she did not speak, but the look on her face made it clear that whatever she was attempting, it <em>had</em> worked this time. 

She lifted her gaze, her eyes landing on something unseen to Kaleva. Golden sparkles danced around the outer surface of her eyes, and her expression softened and warmed as if looking upon someone she loved dearly and had not seen in a painfully long time. 

There were a few moments of silence. And then she delicately whispered, &quot;Please let him come, too. Just this once.&quot;


A beat. And then a warm wind buffeted Kaleva&#39;s face, forcing his eyes to close. Something in his core gave a sensation like falling--but Skena&#39;s hand was still on his, and he never lost the sensation of that grip there. When he managed to open his eyes again, he was somewhere else entirely.

He still sat on the ground, with Skena still beside him. But they were somewhere that looked like the wilderness of the Cusai desert in the middle of the night. A waning crescent moon hung in the center of a sky that was vast, and full of more stars than Kaleva had ever witnessed in all his travels. And despite the thin sliver of the crescent, it cast the silvery glow of a full moon, illuminating the desert surrounding them in an ethereal wash that would have made it all crystal clear, even if they did not have the ability to see in the dark. 

But it was more than just the dreamlike scenery. The environment came with a thorough sensation of peace. Of all one&#39;s needs being eternally met. It was not the wild desert where someone would have an inherent caution about encountering snakes or scorpions or the like. There was no sense of danger. Barely even a sense of true <em>wilderness</em>. It was, in a word, comforting. Comforting beyond all measure.

All of that would sink in only a mere heartbeat before two more details became apparent. Firstly, if he looked to his side where his friend was seated, the aasimar he saw there would be one he hadn&#39;t seen in years. She bore no wounds, even looked surprisingly healthy despite her naturally gaunt features. And most prominently, her head was adorned in a shimmering halo of twinkling lights like millions of tiny stars, glowing strong and unfalteringly over the crown of her head.

Secondly, opposite them stood a towering figure of a man with the head of a jackal.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He blinked at Skena&#39;s whisper, his brow faintly furrowed in confusion, before he felt that wind that forced his eyes closed, and felt himself falling. His grip tightened on Skena&#39;s hand, and when he finally opened his eyes and saw Cusai all around them, his eyes went wide.

Jaw dropped, he took in the scenery, the stars and the moon, the inherent... <em>peacefulness</em> of this place. And then there was Skena, like she&#39;d stepped out of his memories, that halo that he&#39;d almost forgotten the look of now proudly shining around her.

And then he saw Anubis, and his breath and his heart caught. He was frozen for a moment, and then lowered his head and shoulders, averting his gaze in distinctly submissive body language, despite how much he wanted to just... stare, to take in His appearance, to commit every detail to memory. His tail curled in close to his body, and he... was scared.

Who was he to a God, anyway? A tainted filthblood, descended from devils, a thief and a murderer. Unworthy to be in His presence.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She glanced over to Kaleva, saw him... cowering. Her brows knit slightly over her gentle smile, and--without releasing his hand--she slowly pushed herself to her feet, giving him a gentle tug to coax him into standing as well. 

If she was in his position, faced with a god she only barely was familiar with, she&#39;d likely feel similarly humble. But the reality was... this wasn&#39;t just a deity she worshipped. She felt a degree of familiarity towards this entity that never made her feel like she needed to grovel. The god she knew was one she wanted to hug. And she wanted Kaleva to feel the same. 

Shifting to bring her free hand around so it could clasp over their already joined hands, she pulled him a few paces forward--tugging quite firmly if he resisted--to close some of the distance between them and the jackal-headed figure who stood at least fifteen feet tall. When she had done her best to pull Kaleva along with her, she turned her gaze back towards the god, who... seemed to be watching this all with a sort of timeless patience. 

For an entity who had the head of a carnivorous predator--one whose visage even Kaleva used in acts of ferocity--He somehow did not appear sharp or stern. The was an inherent regality to His posture, but... a softness to His eyes. As if to further support this detail, as the two young adults drew closer, the god&#39;s posture shifted, and He gracefully eased into a kneel. Actually bringing Himself closer to their level instead of domineering over them.

Skena had stars in her eyes--which, in this environment, was only partially metaphorical. There was a subtle twinkle to every move she made. She may have had an ear to ear grin were the expression not gently reined in with soft awe. 

&quot;... I know the confines of this magic are limiting,&quot; she started--and despite the quiet words being barely above a whisper, they carried easily across the entirety of this space, making it effortless to hear every syllable. &quot;So I hope it&#39;s okay for me to... push the boundaries slightly.&quot; She gave Kaleva&#39;s hand a little squeeze.

&quot;... If Kaleva and I parted and never saw each other again after today... would you still watch over him?&quot;

The canid head turned from facing Skena, to directing His gaze at the tiefling beside her. As His gaze shifted, His eyes--sold gold with no pupil, matching the color of Skena&#39;s own irises--shimmered, and changed to a teal green shade that perfectly mirrored the color of Kaleva&#39;s. When His maw parted, the voice that came forth was wonderfully deep and uniquely textured, sounding as though it came from all around them like an unshakably calm, protective embrace.

When Anubis spoke, he jolted, and it took him a moment to register what he said. <em>Blood of Loki?</em> Swallowing that revelation, he slowly lifted his gaze, and looked up at the God before him.

Tears spilled from his eyes and tracked down his face when he looked into eyes that mirrored his own. His throat closed up. This was so much different than that day in the colosseum, so much more clear. But even through the fear and awe of standing before Him, the love he felt toward this being filled him, and he managed a small, tremulous smile.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">I have been watching over you since long before you knew how to see me.</code></strong>

The words seemed to spur memories to the surface of Kaleva&#39;s mind; though Anubis did not say anything specific, it was like the words guided Kaleva&#39;s focus to various moments in his life all at once. The way he had, as a young child, been able to finally pry his way out of the basement his entire prior existence had been confined to. The way his first true comfort in life was a gentle dog. The way Marko had raised him in the wilderness, showing him how to take only what he needed, to respect and work alongside the natural order instead of blazing a trail against it. Even the less comforting memories of finding the devastation that had claimed Marko&#39;s life--now present in his memory not with the pain that they had always carried before, but a quiet peace as the implication alongside that carnage became one of all those souls Kaleva loved, now gently welcomed into Anubis&#39; care. Every little decision Kaleva made as a young adolescent on the path from that bloodied snow all the way to Cautica, seemingly random choices and circumstances that now all lit up in his mind like lines between stars in a constellation. A path, subtly guided by a quiet divinity, taking him exactly where he needed to be. Showing him what love was, what he was worthy of. Giving him something to hold onto in the years that followed. Every hunt he went on, the way he continued to take only what he needed, to move with nature and not against it. Even in his years with the gang in Moredrey, the understanding that all of his actions came from a place of hurt and loneliness, never sadism or true malice. Even the awful years in prison... it was like there was a faint, fragile hand over his mind, a thin barrier to keep him from irreparably breaking despite all he endured. Visits from someone kind, despite how small of a blessing it ultimately was. But someone who he would meet again, and would be able to look in the eye and truly know he could trust them because of the gestures they took to extend that kindness in his time of need. And of course, the path Skena was led on that brought her back into his life. Like welcoming him home after a long and arduous day of grueling experiences to be met with the open embrace of unconditional love he deserved. The two of them finally finding unyielding stability in one another that they had only gotten a taste of before. So many things that Kaleva had always quietly wanted, bit by bit coming to fruition.

This sudden realization that he wasn&#39;t just someone Anubis had a vested interest in because of the role he played in Skena&#39;s life; Anubis brought Skena into <em>his</em> as a way of giving him the love he deserved.

He cried harder than he&#39;d ever cried in his life. All of the pain and insecurity he&#39;d carried with him through his entire existence, all the deep-rooted lack of worth brought on by a lifetime of prejudice and hatred, all of it poured forth like a festering wound finally lanced and allowed to breathe, to purge all the sickness and pus so he could finally, finally heal, thanks to the loving hand of a God he&#39;d looked up to and loved for so long, but had never known for sure if he was deserving of His love in return. Until now.

Kaleva sank down into the sands and buried his face in his hands, and when all the tears had finally run out, he felt simultaneously exhausted and lighter than he&#39;d ever felt in his life. He felt Anubis&#39; love like a shield around his heart, and knew that the hatred of others would never be able to touch him again.

She knew it was the raw sobbing of a soul that was finally liberated. And it was all she had ever wanted in life.

As his crying gradually ran dry, there was the foreign touch of a gentle hand that dipped beneath his chin, lifting his face to see that the visage of the pitch-black wolf was now standing directly before him, the figure closer to the size of a typical human (though quite a tall one still). His hand was cool to the touch, though not uncomfortably so. Not unlike Skena&#39;s own body. A thumb, the digit somehow both thick and simultaneously bony, and tipped in a canid claw that was not wholly dissimilar from how Kaleva&#39;s appeared in his lycan form, swept softly across his cheek to clear away the tears staining his charcoal skin.

At first.

When his consciousness was next aware of something, he realized he was... in the mountains. It looked similar to the wilderness he had known in Holbrook. There was snow on the ground, but... he didn&#39;t feel uncomfortably cold. In fact, though nothing was visually the same... the feeling of quiet peace and safety was reminiscent of the vision he had earlier shared with Skena.

He was walking through the trees, moving forward simply because it felt right to be doing so. Light, sparse snowflakes fell silently around him, the crunch of snow underfoot being familiar and nearly nostalgic in his ears. It was scenic and beautiful. Just as beautiful as the dreamlike desert earlier, but beautiful in a different way. He felt like he could wander aimlessly in this space forever. 

And then his gaze landed on another figure in the snow ahead of him. A big Samoyed, her fur gently dusted in accumulated snow.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Paused to look back at him, saw that he was following. Then continued to bounce through the snow, making sure she never ran too far away. 

They ran together for a while through the trees, until she led him to a place where the trees parted. As they ran out of the trees, Kaleva saw they were on a large cliff, a rocky ledge that extended beyond the treeline like a picturesque platform. The perfect place to be to observe the expanse of sky all around. Countless mountains lined the bottom of the horizon, but the sky above felt endless and vast, not a single cloud obscuring the immense number of stars dusted above him. And, most prominently, the sky was softly illuminated with the dancing lights of the aurora borealis, like a living painting that this view--everything from the ledge to the crust of mountains framing the sky--was solely meant to display in its full glory.

And Kaleva was not alone in appreciating it. Another figure was sitting a short distance away, on a place of the cliff where the snow had been cleared away, and a small campfire was crackling. It was a grizzled old tiefling, with long, blonde hair and a similarly long beard comprised largely of fluffy white streaks. He seemed to be watching the sky, but looked over as Whisper bounded back to him, her tail wagging away excitedly.

&quot;You finally found him, did ya, girl?&quot; He asked, almost lazily, as he looked further back to see Kaleva. &quot;She&#39;s been out looking for you all day.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He wasn&#39;t sure why he hadn&#39;t realized it with Whisper. He remembered her body laying in the snow a short ways away from Marko&#39;s, almost invisible save for the red, sticky blood in her fur. But she had seemed peaceful in death, like she was sleeping.

Marko&#39;s horns had been cut off from his head, his eyes open and glazed, and he had been strung up in a macabre display as a warning to any other tieflings in the area.

Approaching them, he went to go sit down beside Marko, gazing up at the aurora borealis.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Whisper shimmied up to sit right against Kaleva&#39;s side, the puff of her soft fur providing an old comfort as she continued to make the occasional happy noise. While Marko did not exhibit the same giddy excitement, there was... a bit of a softness to his gaze as he looked Kaleva up and down.

Whisper was immediately back to being giddy and tail-waggy and licking all over Kaleva&#39;s face with happy grunts and miniature <em>awoo</em>s. 

&quot;Come on, old girl,&quot; Marko called after they&#39;d had their little embrace, &quot;Lead the way for my <em>senile ass</em>.&quot;

With a final, meaningful lick on the tip of Kaleva&#39;s nose, Whisper finally pulled away from him, seeming calmed by having successfully found him. She trotted loyally back towards her master, and then beyond him, doing as asked and leading him back towards the treeline. 

Marko lingered a moment longer, looking back at Kaleva long enough to give a final little nod towards him. He&#39;d said about all he knew how to say, but he seemed at peace with that. Finally, he turned and started off after Whisper, his stride slow and easy... but not quite the stiff and achy movements of an old man. 

He seemed to indeed be doing just fine.

As Kaleva watched, the forms of both Whisper and Marko began to waver like mirages, transforming bit by bit into ribbons of green and blue light. That light drifted up through the air like the smoke had from the campfire, until it had joined in with the rest of the aurora borealis above.

Kaleva would be able to watch the dancing lights for a while longer, standing by himself on the cliff without... actually feeling alone. Gradually, the dream faded, and as he watched the ethereal light in the sky, he soon found the vision being replaced with the groggier sight of the bed around him as he roused back to the waking world. That supernatural feeling of everlasting peace was gone, but a bit of it still lingered, like residue of the dream. 

This mortal world was not inherently peaceful, but... in this moment, in the home he had built, surrounded by those who loved him... it was very nearly just as good.

He felt... lighter. Less burdened by the suffering he&#39;d known throughout his life. Those scars were still there, of course, they&#39;d never be fully healed. But they didn&#39;t weigh so heavily on him that morning, and he let himself just savor the feeling of being happy and at peace.

But Atreyu was too much of a puppy to want to spend the entire morning in bed, and soon climbed out of bed, grabbing the blanket under Kaleva and starting to tug at it, yanking him right off the mattress and onto the floor with a thud.

&quot;<em>Oof!</em> Tre, you <em>dick.</em>&quot; Kaleva scoffed out a laugh, which just got louder as Atreyu started dragging the blanket - and Kaleva, subsequently - out of the bedroom. &quot;What are you-- Look, I&#39;ll get up, would you just-- where are we going??&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Turning off the stove, she scooped the last of the pancakes onto a plate that held a stack of fresh ones, and picked up that, as well as a plate full of sausage, bacon, and eggs, walking it over to where Kaleva sat and placing them down in front of him.

A couple bites of eggy while he thought, he continued on. &quot;Fenrir is a monstrous wolf, son of Loki and... I can&#39;t remember her name, but some giantess. Anger-something.

“Fenrir? I can research into him today. If it’s as you describe, then I think it would be possible for some… cultist or something who followed him to have brought infernal heritage into their bloodline. And Anubis would still have been accurate by calling you blood of Loki, a god.” She shrugged.

“Maybe that was His way of associating you with something you could be proud to be titled. Something that rang a bit more noble than <em>blood of Fenrir</em>. It might sound a bit judgmental or antagonistic if he called you by an ancestral tie to an evil entity. If you are a descendant of some tie to Fenrir, I think… I think Anubis only referencing Loki may have been a show of respect.”

She tucked a bite of sugared up pancake into her mouth, chewing a moment, before continuing. “But maybe there’s a silver lining about Fenrir. Who knows.

I&#39;m--wow, I&#39;m surprised you remembered. Yeah, it... actually became a recurring nightmare in the years after you left. It was always the same. There was a heart on Anubis&#39; scales, being weighed against Maat&#39;s feather. I could tell the heart was going to be lighter as the scales settled, but before they were able to fully settle and yield a verdict, chains would rise up and strap themselves over the heart, dragging it downwards. The first time I had the dream, that&#39;s about all there was to it. I just helplessly watched as the heart plummeted into this abyss. But in later versions of the dream, I&#39;d reach out and grab the heart, trying to pull it back up. But the resistance that created would cause the chains to slice into the heart as they pulled, covering my hands in blood. And I could never lift it all the way back up, I just... delayed the inevitable. Sometimes I would grab the chains instead, and try to pull those up, but then they&#39;d slice into my fingers as I pulled. And I never managed to affect any real change. Just sometimes put up a bit of fight... but the heart always ended up drowned in the abyss.&quot;

She shook her head a little. &quot;I was never entirely sure what the dream was supposed to be conveying. Sometimes I had ideas, but nothing consistent ever seemed to trigger them. I had it the first time when you were in Cautica, but in the years after you left, there was no rhyme or reason to when I would have the dream. It seemed strange to attribute it to you when it was still happening years after you had gone silent in my life, triggered even when things were relatively doing okay in my world.

&quot;I thought I was having it again last night,&quot; she continued softly. &quot;And I haven&#39;t had that dream in... years. Certainly not since we&#39;ve reunited. I was... scared at first. When I recognized the images. I saw the heart, saw the chains slither around it, and reflexively reached to grab the chains and pull. But... this time, the chains snapped. This time I actually did pull the heart back up. And... it&#39;s... hard to describe, but... when the chains snapped, in that split second, I just... <em>understood</em> something.&quot; She looked up at him, her brows knit slightly. 

&quot;I hadn&#39;t been sure before, but it&#39;s clear now that the heart belongs to you. Which I say because... when those chains snapped, I was flooded with this knowledge that every time I had the nightmare before, it was because of what was happening to you. Even when I wasn&#39;t with you, couldn&#39;t see you, didn&#39;t know what was going on, someone had tried to damn you for who you were. And the memories you carried of me were trying to lift you back up, but they couldn&#39;t. And I didn&#39;t realize it until now, but... I was made aware of it every time. Of every time some piece of me was trying to pull up some piece of you, but never being able to truly save you from the things happening to you. When the chains broke, I understood what they represented. And it&#39;s... realizing in hindsight how <em>much</em>... I...&quot;

Skena took a deep breath, her eyes a bit wide. &quot;... I... I don&#39;t know. On one hand... it&#39;s more than a little unnerving that he could put out a bounty on information about me like that, and, had we not been extremely fortunate with Achoris, have <em>gotten</em> said information quite easily. It&#39;s unnerving that someone would want information like that to find something to leverage against me, because... unless <em>using</em> that leverage was as simple as airing out my dirty laundry to the locals, he actually <em>could</em> do real damage with authentic information. He could get in contact with Oberon... tell him where I am. Tell him I&#39;m still associating with Anubis, still acting as a cleric to Anubis. And... gods, I don&#39;t know what Oberon would <em>do</em> with that information, but... but if he at any point decided he wanted me back, he could know where to find me if someone like that made it easier for him.&quot; She slowly ran a hand through her hair, teetering on the edge of a stress spiral, though not quite having fallen down it yet.

&quot;... On the other hand... I think he saved my life yesterday. That hag <em>brutalized</em> him with her necrotic magic. Neither of us realized how intensely necrotic magic would carve through Jaska due to his condition. But when the hag focused its attacks solely on me, he jumped in and killed it with a direct attack, putting himself at risk of sustaining more damage that had almost killed him in one fell swoop earlier. Just to get it off me. And I&#39;m not naive enough to think that means he cares deeply for me or something, but... even the most harshly critical assessment of that would be that he very much wants me to stay alive for his benefit. To the point where he&#39;s willing to risk himself to some degree to ensure my safety. And... when we arrived back here, I healed him--and put myself in the state you came home to in the process--and he... he kept offering to make me something to eat or carry me to bed. And I asked him where that was coming from, and he said he considered me an ally. And the way he said it, the word wasn&#39;t... pragmatic like it would be to you or I. I mean, it was, but there was something else. He said it like saying so made him vulnerable.&quot; She shook her head, squinting indecisively. 

&quot;Furthermore... If the misinformation successfully got back to him, then... I mean, I was so out of it yesterday, but I still feel like I probably would have noticed if he said something like that with an undertone of sinister implication, like he knew it was a lie. But he seemed perfectly at face-value and sincere with the words. And if he believes that the darkest dirt he has on me is that we&#39;re star-crossed lovers who were driven out of Cautica for some forbidden romance, then... then even if he <em>does</em> try to hurt me, he wouldn&#39;t know how to do so effectively. Right?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But based on what you&#39;ve said... It&#39;s clear that he does have a vested interest in keeping you alive and on his side. Which is good.&quot;

His tail flicked to one side, then to the other. &quot;Speaking as someone who is intimately familiar with paranoia and distrust... I think I can see where he&#39;s coming from. I think having information on you is a security blanket for him. So that you&#39;re not the one holding all the cards, and if you ever decided to use the information you have on him to hurt him, he&#39;ll have ammunition to fight back with. But as long as you don&#39;t give him a reason to use it, that ammunition stays in its box.&quot;

Kaleva glanced back up at her. &quot;I could be wrong, but that&#39;s how I&#39;d see it. Unless there&#39;s something deeper going on that he&#39;s setting up, but I can&#39;t imagine what that would be, or why he&#39;d turn on you when you&#39;ve been nothing but helpful to him. Purely from a pragmatic point of view, he&#39;d be wasting a valuable resource turning on you.

Then, he let out a low curse. &quot;And he knows how to get here, too.&quot; He didn&#39;t blame Skena for bringing him here, he understood why, and that was before they knew what he was up to.

&quot;For all we know about him - that his soul is decaying, that he has a young devil he adopted, that he&#39;s skilled and dangerous in combat... What do we know about <em>him?</em> What are his motivations? Where did he come from? He... Didn&#39;t know that children have baby teeth and adult teeth, how could he not know that?

But… he only knows how to get here through the portal, and he can’t do that without one of us with him. He doesn’t really know where we are in relation to town if he had to get here traditionally, at least.”

She drifted off in thought as Kaleva posed questions. “… His sister is Valentine, brother is Luka. But he seems to like Valentine and be close to her, whereas he seems to <em>loathe</em> Luka. Which… Luka’s always seemed very inoffensive to me. Reminds me… almost of myself, in some ways? In his demeanor? So I have no clue what Luka did to earn that hatred. But Jaska was just casually talking about stabbing him last night—he found a dagger in the swamp that he thinks will cause more harm to creatures of a good nature, and he mentioned testing it on his brother to see if… oh what did he say… to see if he was as innocent as Valentine claimed he was. And he’ll refer to Valentine as his sister, or Axa’s aunt, but only ever refers to Luka by his name, never claims any familial ties to him. So something is definitely fracturing that family, but… I have no idea what. I haven’t interacted with Luka enough to know if the hatred is reciprocated the other way around too. But with Valentine… she seems staunchly protective of Jaska. Luka, too… she doesn’t seem to participate in any of that hatred. She paid me out of her own funds for my discretion when she first had me come over and treat Jaska’s condition. And she’s… always smiling and polite and personable, but something about how she asked for my discretion almost sounded like a threat. And—have you noticed her staff actively looks around at stuff? Almost like it’s a creature of its own? I have no idea what that’s about. It could just be a construct, though.”

She shook her head slowly. “… Jaska is fiercely protective and loving towards Axa. The… <em>panic</em> in his face when he thought she was sick because she lost a tooth… that little girl is his world. But I don’t know why he didn’t know about children losing their teeth. The most obvious answer to that would be that he himself either weirdly never lost baby teeth, or… he wasn’t ever a child? Or maybe he was a child, but for some reason, has no memory of those years. But beyond that…” she shrugged, looking at Kaleva helplessly, “I have no idea. I’m just as in the dark as you are.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Shaking his head slightly, he muttered, &quot;The more I hear about that family, the more it puts me on edge. I agree that from what I&#39;ve seen of Luka, he seems harmless.

The rest of the morning was spent largely in the library, after a brief detour to get the paint Kaleva had requested. When she had exhausted the local knowledge on Holbrook deities, she dipped into the bakery to purchase three chocolate chip cookies, wrapping up and tucking away two in her bag while nibbling on the third. A nutritious lunch.

From there, she headed back to a road she didn&#39;t usually have business on, wandering half aimlessly until she found the massage parlor. Wrapping up the half of the cookie she hadn&#39;t finished eating, she tucked it away and smushed down Gummy in her bag as well, gingerly pushing open the door and stepping in to look around.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Several plants softened the interior, creeping vines that trailed down the walls. The area was lit by soft, warm lamps, and there was even a little koi pond in the seating area with a small waterfall that provided a constant water trickle sound. The little bell above the door dinged softly when Skena entered, and a few moments later Luka walked out from the back area.

The similarities to Jaska were evident in his facial structure and the shape of his eyes, but while Jaska was whipcord thin, Luka had a slightly more filled out figure that softened the sharp cheekbones of his face and made him look far less severe than his brother. His long, wavy ombre hair was pulled back into a loose ponytail, and the golden eyes that turned to Skena had a peaceful gentleness about them, warm and welcoming and friendly. His horns curled around his ears like his sister&#39;s, but his tail forked at the end like Jaska&#39;s.

I think people get into trouble when they think it&#39;s their obligation to encourage everyone they encounter to think and feel the way they do. But... even when I don&#39;t understand someone&#39;s way of forging a path through this world, I can coexist with it and... for lack of a better term, mind my own business.&quot; She offered Luka a small smile.

&quot;But in fewer words: I wasn&#39;t intrigued to meet you based on Jaska&#39;s recommendation. Even Axa, as minimalist as she is with traditional communication, has occasionally expressed disdain for an individual... but I&#39;ve never seen her show signs of distinctly disliking you. Between her... abstract, but undeniably brutally honest impressions of the world around her, and Valentine&#39;s eternally glowing praise... and the fact that you run a therapeutic business, which neighbors many of my interests and a bit of my life&#39;s work... you seemed like a good person to know.&quot; She exhaled softly. 

&quot;That, and... I&#39;m not much of an extrovert, but I&#39;ve been realizing lately that my circle is quite small. It was understandable when I was new to town, but at this point it&#39;s losing its justification.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Thank you, Skena. I will do my best not to disappoint. Admittedly I could use more friends myself. I have plenty of clients who I see regularly and am happy to greet and speak with when we encounter each other out in the city, but I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m a bit of a shut in socially.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m... actually a bit of a runaway. Well. No, that&#39;s not accurate. I&#39;m in exile,&quot; she admitted slowly. &quot;I used to... be a sort of... crown jewel at a temple in another country. I lived there, grew up there... I never knew my biological parents--&quot; her cadence hiccupped a little as she realized that was not entirely accurate, either, but... one thing at a time, &quot;--I was dropped off at the temple as an infant, and raised by the Head Priest and clergy. And... that was a great deal put on my shoulders, because... who I inherently was had me set up to be an important person from the day I arrived there, with no room for deviation. And I... suppose I dropped the ball quite irreparably a couple years back, and I was cast out for it.&quot; She paused, before shaking her head a little. 

&quot;But those details aren&#39;t relevant.&quot; Why had she just divulged them so easily? Maybe that--that lonely gleam in Luka&#39;s eyes was breaking her heart. She wanted to be his friend. &quot;I share this to explain that my whole life, all I knew were sacred practices surrounding death. Funeral practices, embalming, dissection, everything in those realms of study. And... despite how little wiggle room I had in how I was raised, those things have always been natural fascinations of mine, so I had little need to rebel against the trellis I was set to grow upon.&quot; <em>Until roughly around the time I was forced to perform euthanasia...</em> &quot;And while those things were practiced in a religious context at the temple, much of my free time was spent engrossing myself in the science behind it all. Anatomy, biology, psychology. I&#39;m no massage therapist,&quot; she added with a little smile, &quot;But I&#39;ve relocated more dislocated joints and realigned more compound fractures than I could count. I think, in a pinch, I could be an emergency chiropractic. I&#39;ve certainly done triage, anyways. And that&#39;s... kind of like chiropractic procedures... just... a lot messier.

He turned his thoughts to the rest of her rambling, and mused softly, &quot;The schools are complimentary.

The collagen builds up in the damaged tissue to heal and strengthen the wound. But the body doesn&#39;t know how to arrange these collagen cells into their natural structure, and so they just... clump together, causing tightness and stiffness in the affected area.

I don&#39;t want to take you away from too much more of your business today, but... if you&#39;re willing, and not previously engaged, we&#39;d love to have you over for dinner tonight.&quot; There was a touch of something solemn, but earnest in her small smile. &quot;I can introduce you to the person I wear my scars for. I think you two would get along.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

... <em>What Did Jaska Hate Him For?!</em>

That was going to bother her fiercely. But at least now they&#39;d have a conversation over dinner, with Kaleva present alongside her, to maybe delicately probe about the issue further. But even if the mystery wasn&#39;t solved... she genuinely did look forward to interacting with the man more. He had all of Valentine&#39;s sunshine, with none of that... occasional glimpse of something sinister and threatening beneath the smiles that Skena had picked up on from his sister.

What a bizarre family.

She made a few stops at various other shops before heading back home, hunting down Arsast in his home to let him know to expect Luka, before dipping through the portal herself. As she shouldered through the second bookcase-door and into the main room, her bag was nice and full with various new purchases, and Gummy leapt out to lighten her load somewhat as they returned home.

&quot;Kaleva?&quot; She called out lightly, looking to see if he was home as she made her way towards the kitchen to put groceries away.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Tuesday, March 22, 2022 10:46 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Kaleva, I have even <em>less</em> ideas about why Jaska hates him than I did before I met him,&quot; Skena replied frankly. &quot;Luka has to be one of the single nicest people I&#39;ve ever had a conversation with in my entire life. And he just looks so... <em>lonely</em> and it&#39;s heartbreaking. The look on his face when I explained I worked with Jaska, like he was fully expecting Jaska to have tainted my impression of him, and for that to have lost him the chance at another friend... oh my <em>gods</em>, Kaleva, I&#39;ve never had a stranger break my heart like that.&quot;

She shook her head, setting out the sweet potatoes she had bought. &quot;I wasn&#39;t blinded by sympathy or anything. I genuinely could not, for the life of me, get any hint of <em>anything</em> even worth <em>slightly disliking</em> him over.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She sounded thoroughly bewildered. And like this might keep her up at night. &quot;Something <em>must</em> have happened between them. More than just them being incompatible. Because Luka is... a little bit like me, a little bit like Valentine, and both Valentine and I are people Jaska has no trouble getting along with. There had to have been some sort of actual <em>event</em> that put them at odds. Maybe Luka did something that Jaska considered a betrayal. It&#39;s--I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s very likely, but maybe it&#39;s possible Luka used to be someone completely different, and who I met today is a reformed sinner or something.

&quot;So--Most of what you had remembered of the stories was accurate, in broad terms. The giantess&#39; name was <em>Angrbo&#240;a</em>,&quot; she added, probably not pronouncing it correctly, as she had only read it and not heard it spoken. &quot;Fenrir is a son of her and Loki, and Sk&#246;ll and Hati are offspring of Fenrir. There don&#39;t seem to be a great <em>quantity</em> of stories about Fenrir, as the narrative around him is very straightforward. He was a being of immense, pure evil, and the gods realized that and sought to bind him to lock him away. There was some poetic fluff about him being bound with the sound of a cat&#39;s footsteps and the beard of a woman and such, things that are paradoxical in nature. In the process of him being bound, he bit off the hand of the god, Tyr, so they effectively gagged him by running a sword through his maw. That pantheon believes that when Ragnar&#246;k comes, he will break free of his binds and swallow the god, Odin, after which Odin&#39;s son, V&#237;&#240;arr, will avenge him by killing Fenrir. Sk&#246;ll and Hati seem similarly straightforward; Sk&#246;ll is said to chase the sun across the sky, while Hati chases the moon. And when Ragnar&#246;k comes, both will finally catch and devour the celestial bodies.&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, March 23, 2022 8:41 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

If it wasn&#39;t a trick, he wouldn&#39;t bite down. Tyr knew he would lose his hand but sacrificed it anyway to ensure he was bound.&quot;

Reaching up to pluck sprigs of dried herbs from the bundles they hung from, he began to crumble them in his hands and rub them into the steaks. &quot;I always thought it was kind of sad.

She glanced over with a sympathetic smile as he continued. &quot;Loose parallels, maybe. By all accounts, Fenrir is meant to be the embodiment of evil. But... then again... those who record such knowledge as this tend to be bards, with a passion to embellish. Similar stories were told of Achoris, even in the short time since his exile--comparatively to Fenrir, anyways--and as it turns out, there&#39;s much nuance to him beyond a blanket label of evilness.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I think there are objective cases of good and evil... celestial beings are good. Fiends are evil.&quot; A pause, and she glanced pointedly towards Kaleva, &quot;True celestials and fiends. Not aasimar and tieflings. I&#39;m talking about devils in the Nine Hells, or the celestial beings who act as hands of the gods they serve throughout the different planes of Heaven. There is little nuance to the nature of creatures like that. But... mortals?&quot; She shook her head.

&quot;I think... labels like good and evil are... purely subjective in the case of mortals. Maybe there&#39;s some metric that the gods use to judge... maybe it&#39;s as simple as <em>good</em> being those whose hearts weigh lighter than a feather, and <em>evil</em> being those who are destined to be devoured by Ammit. But that distinction is for Anubis to make, not me. Not any mortal. No, I don&#39;t personally consider Achoris to be evil. But only based on my subjective understanding of what defines <em>evil.</em>&quot;

She shrugged. &quot;But Achoris is a mortal. The labels affixed to him come from other mortals who simply didn&#39;t like the things he did. Fenrir is not mortal--but I can&#39;t say for sure where these accounts originate from. The word of the gods? Passed deliberately down to mortal storytellers? Or are these perspectives originating from just... more mortals? Embellished as they passed down generations until it was all just poetic narrative? Maybe your sadness is founded. Maybe Fenrir was a victim of circumstances. Maybe these are unjust portrayals of him.&quot; She made a bit of a helpless face. 

&quot;But it&#39;s all we have to go off of. Taken with a grain of salt or not, the story of Fenrir seems to have little room for drastically deviating versions of events. I found several records, by several different authors, written at several different points of history--past and present--and the variations between them were negligible.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;...And where does that leave a pureblooded devil like Axa? A child? Can we look at her, at her pure devilish blood, and say that it is her nature to be evil and there&#39;s no chance of her being able to deviate from that?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I think...&quot; she sighed, pausing a moment to actually think.

&quot;Speaking strictly literally. She is not mortal. If she is killed on the material plane, she will be... in a sense, re-assembled back in Hell. The only way to truly kill her would be to kill her in Hell. Now... I&#39;m not saying I wholeheartedly subscribe to this with no room for nuance or exceptions. But if my studies have been accurate... yes, she would be inherently evil. What it means to be <em>evil</em>, I can&#39;t say. She could be inherently evil, but through nurturing, grow beyond that original capacity. But <em>evil</em> doesn&#39;t mean void of love. Dispater, one of the most prominent archdevils and lord of Dis, the second layer of Hell, seems to be, by all accounts, quite earnestly in love with a mortal woman named Erecura. Despite Dispater being about as traditionally evil as they come. I think... again, not to say this is a hill I&#39;m willing to die on... but I think in regards to beings like devils, <em>evil</em> as a label is meant to describe a core driving force. Kind of... like an instinct. If I threw something at your head right now, you&#39;d flinch, or duck, or move to grab it. That&#39;s inherent to how you live. In a vaguely similar sense, beings like fiends are... <em>predisposed</em> to certain motivations. Just as celestials are predisposed towards different motivations. What they are is so integral to <em>who</em> they are, whereas mortals can kind of be... whatever, agnostic of the body or ancestry they were born into.&quot;

She shrugged again. &quot;But... for someone like Axa... I genuinely cannot say what she has the potential for. Strictly by the books, she is what most would agree to be <em>evil</em>. I don&#39;t know if such creatures, even with the right circumstances, are able to be anything outside of that.&quot; She shook her head, leaning back on the counter as she stared up at the ceiling in thought.

&quot;Mind you... devils and devas and all of those creatures... they&#39;re not like mortals. The same way there aren&#39;t really instances we know of where a wolf identifies as a rabbit, wants to live life like a rabbit. No, a wolf will always only know how to be a predator. Does that mean a wolf is incapable of forming a bond with an animal it normally preys upon? No, not at all. There have been recorded instances of that. But it is still a wolf. People like you and I aren&#39;t bound to such confines, which is why it feels so wrong to label someone in broad strokes. I... I think that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to explain, anyways.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She may be tamed, in time, to accept affection from mortals, to not prey upon them at will. But she will never not be that wolf. There will always be some non-zero percent chance that her nature resurfaces, regardless of the nurturing she has received. There is a reason people do not walk around with things like manticores as pets. Some creatures can give the illusion of having their predatory natures tamed out of them, but the chance of them reverting to their deeply ingrained nature is never fully eliminated.&quot;

She took a deep breath then. &quot;... Mind you, this is just my understanding based on the research I have done. Granted, it&#39;s been a <em>lot</em> of research over decades of time... but there&#39;s always a chance that our mortal understanding of such matters is not wholly accurate. But if what I know is well informed, Jaska was <em>immensely</em> wise to bind Axa as he did, keeping himself safe--and also keeping safe anyone he deemed under his protection.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Contracts, rules, fine print. Jaska seemed to understand that well enough to be <em>exceptionally</em> thorough in his contact with her. And I think she would sooner tear herself apart at the seams than violate the contract she was sealed to, just because... that&#39;s what she is. She&#39;s a creature of law just as much as a creature of evil. And with those safeguards in place, she has a very good chance of carrying on the life that would be given to a little mortal girl in her position. Her wings are clipped, in a sense. And she does seem fairly happy. <em>Much</em> calmer and more enjoying of her surroundings than when she first was brought home. For now, I at least am reasonably confident she&#39;s safe to be around... provided you&#39;re someone Jaska wants to keep alive, and are consequentially under his protection.&quot;

She pushed off the counter, going back to leafing through her notes. &quot;But I digress. The reality is that we have no way of knowing for sure if Fenrir is evil like a fiend, or if Fenrir is evil the way Achoris has been labeled such; a label applied subjectively by mortals. I would hope, actually, that he is evil by nature, if only because I would agree that it would be quite sad to have his legacy as it is were it not accurate. If he was merely a victim of circumstances, of poor influence. I hope it is as binary as the stories make it sound. But either way, you won&#39;t find me hunting him down to free him from his bonds.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Your apparent ancestry, your childhood, your magic, and your religion, too. In a slightly more indirect sense,&quot; Skena agreed. 

&quot;Well, I did poke around a bit with things in culture surrounding Fenrir. And there weren&#39;t any records that were concrete, nothing that pointed to names of organizations or anything, but it did seem to imply that cultists had existed across the ages--not often, but enough to warrant brief documentation. I suppose their philosophy was that Fenrir would grant protection and power to those who freed him, which is... well, what a lot of cults around condemnable entities seem to be drawn towards. But it would stand to reason that it&#39;s entirely possible that your ancestry includes at least one of these cultists. Perhaps even a warlock who drew power of some degree from Fenrir. I would be absolutely <em>fascinated</em> if that were the case; it would lend credence to the idea that Fenrir <em>would</em> actually tempt mortals with power in exchange for freedom. But if I had a sword through my face for all eternity, I&#39;d be bribing anyone who listened, too.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He trailed off at a knock on the door behind the bookshelf, and from outside Atreyu let out a single bark. You know, just in case they hadn&#39;t heard it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Come in, Luka. And thank you for letting him through,&quot; she added towards the satyr. As if welcoming him in required several things to happen all at once, she bid him inside, thanked Arsast--and then immediately stepped back to look over her shoulder.

Atreyu sat there like a very good boy, still holding the unicorn toy in his mouth. He perked his orange ears forward and wagged his tail, giving the toy a few chews as though he were showing it off. Look at what he had!

&quot;Thank you-- oh good heavens, look at you!&quot; Luka&#39;s eyes went wide as he took in the very large puppy in the living room. &quot;Oh, Skena, he&#39;s gorgeous.

Atreyu let out a muffled woo-woo from around the toy, tail thumping rapidly on the floor. In the kitchen, Kaleva let out a snort of amusement. He liked Luka already.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And when I regained myself, I would be in a different place… Time had passed, and the people who had caused that distress looked at me with fear, often bearing wounds, or simply never to be seen again.

&quot;It wasn&#39;t long before Valentine observed what happened when I was triggered into blacking out. And when I regained consciousness, she told me we had a brother, his name was Jaska, and he lived inside of my mind.&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, March 23, 2022 11:54 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But then how...?

Luka nodded at Skena. &quot;A disorder characterized by the presence of two or more distinct personality states. Previously called multiple personality disorder, it is usually a reaction to trauma as a way to help a person avoid bad memories. In my case, a way to deal with distress and fear. My patron had seemingly fractured my mind and birthed a personality that would handle what I could not… Giving me the means, as promised, to deal with the situations that I was otherwise unable to stand up against.

&quot;At first, I was relieved. I didn&#39;t know what Jaska did while he was piloting my body, but as long as I didn&#39;t have to deal with the unpleasantness, I was content. But… then, my friends stopped talking to me. Started avoiding me, or confronted me and accused me of doing or saying things I had no memory of doing. And it only got worse. I became a social pariah. Valentine was the only one who stuck with me, who got along with this other personality in my head.&quot;

As the words poured out of him, it was almost as though... once he&#39;d started, Luka could hardly stop. A scab was picked off the wound, and now it bled freely. &quot;So I pleaded with our patron to remove him. And he… took that quite literally. I remember my head feeling like it was splitting open. My tail split into two, and another set of horns grew from my skull. It was agony beyond description. I think he was building Jaska a body using my own body&#39;s mass… And if not for Valentine&#39;s interference, I don&#39;t think I would have survived.

&quot;But the damage was done. I still had the extra set of horns, the forked tail. Constant migraines that would lay me out, due to - as I would later find out - an extra eye nestled under my skull. Probably some duplicate or split organs. And Jaska was still there. And now he knew I had tried to get rid of him.&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, March 23, 2022 11:59 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Like he&#39;d scarcely had anyone to talk to about all this stress.

&quot;... How horrific,&quot; she murmured softly. &quot;I--I&#39;ve studied the brain more than almost anything else.&quot; Her brows pinched slightly. &quot;I know how devastating things like brain tumors can be to quality of life.

He looked miserable at the memories. &quot;Jaska didn&#39;t make it easy, either. He was resentful of having to share a body with me, resentful that I had attempted to have him removed. He&#39;d... sabotage my life in ways I could do nothing to prevent or repair. Aside from destroying friendships, he&#39;d get me kicked out of various establishments I had previously enjoyed... I... was miserable, and desperate, to get my life back.

&quot;One day, I learned of a mental hospital in Laracus. A place where they studied such mental disorders as what I thought I had, and worked to cure such things. It seemed the only option left to me… My last chance of getting my life back. So I traveled there, and after speaking with the doctors, I signed myself into their care under the knowledge that I could not sign myself out until my condition was cured, lest Jaska do it for me. They told me… they had a theory. That because Jaska was a fractured part of my own mind, created for the purpose of handling confrontation for me… if they triggered Jaska to emerge, and then caused bad things to happen to him until he withdrew again… maybe they could trick my mind into realizing that Jaska&#39;s presence was not helpful, that the bad things happened as a result of him emerging, and they stopped when he went back in. In that way, they felt they could reverse the psychological break, and Jaska would be eradicated as a coping mechanism.

&quot;I listened to their theories. I heard what they planned to do. And I gave them the okay.&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Thursday, March 24, 2022 12:07 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Because Skena was right. He&#39;d had no one to really talk to about this outside of his sister. And the man was in desperate, desperate need of therapy.

Luka looked up helplessly at the pair, guilt written into every facet of his demeanor. Tears silently tracked down his face. &quot;He was punished just for existing. From the moment he woke, Jaska was forced to deal with hatred and abuse. He was thrust into situations he didn&#39;t ask to be put in, and didn&#39;t have a single conflict resolving tool other than violence and an acerbic tongue. I had already tried to have him removed once. And now, here he was, trapped in an institution and told he was not real, that he was nothing more than a coping mechanism gone wrong, and that the goal of their &#39;research&#39; and &#39;experimentation&#39; was to erase him from existence.&quot;

His voice dropped to a whisper as he choked on his shame and guilt. &quot;They killed him. Over and over again. Electrocution. Drowning. Strangulation. From the moment they triggered him to appear, they started killing him. There was no reprieve. It didn&#39;t stop until he faded into the back of my mind once more. But he always came back. This went on for about three years… until the hospital abruptly found itself under new management, and the atrocities being done were put to an end. I was released, and with nowhere else to go, I started making my way back to Valentine, here in Fielbarry.

&quot;But Jaska was still there. And he did… <em>everything</em> he could to get me back for what I subjected him to. I&#39;d wake up in agony, covered in wounds… cigarette burns, cuts, bruises and broken bones. Hungover, diseased, poisoned… I&#39;d find myself in humiliating and mortifying situations I had no memory of putting myself in. That was my punishment for signing off on his torture… and it still wasn&#39;t enough.&quot;

Reaching up, Luka wiped at his eyes. &quot;Valentine was the one who found out the truth. That Jaska was not a fractured off facet of my mind, but his own separate entity. His own person. Forced to cohabitate with my body against his will. And it was Valentine who finally discovered a means to give Jaska his own body and remove him from my head.

&quot;He&#39;s… calmed, remarkably so, since getting his own body and gaining autonomy. But he will never forgive me for what I put him through. And I can&#39;t blame him for that. I will burn in hell for what I&#39;ve done to him, there&#39;s no amount of good deeds to make up for that. The best thing I can do for him now is stay out of his way and let him live the life he wants to live.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She paused. Sighed. Gave his hand a little squeeze, and continued to keep her hand over his. &quot;How Jaska feels right now is out of your control. Whether or not he ever finds forgiveness does not have anything to do with you. I know it feels like it does because you&#39;ve assumed blame for all of who he is at the moment, but unless I&#39;m making assumptions incorrectly, I get the feeling you&#39;ve made your remorse clear to him. Whether he accepts that or not will depend on where he&#39;s at in his own healing. And it may never happen. Its his prerogative to handle those relationships however he chooses to. You have done the best you can. You sound like you very much have an open-door-policy sort of mindset in regards to making amends with your brother. The ball is in his court. Forgiveness from him may or may not come... but the most important thing missing is you forgiving yourself.&quot;

She tilted her head slightly, her features gently twisted in sympathetic heartbreak for this poor man. She had wondered what horrible secrets must have been between the brothers to create the fracture that she saw between them. But the reality wasn&#39;t any sort of juicy gossip. It was just... thoroughly tragic. Tragic for Luka, and tragic for Jaska. Jaska&#39;s entire demeanor and mannerisms suddenly aligned like celestial bodies in Skena&#39;s perspective; it all made sense. It all tracked perfectly with the background Luka had shared. Of <em>course</em> he was the way he was. How could anyone who began life like that be anything different? It was all completely and utterly transparent with this new context.

&quot;Luka... if someone else told you of how they had unintentionally caused harm to another, but that they were absolutely contrite about it and desperately seeking redemption... would you condemn them? <em>Truly</em> try to listen to your own story, as if it belonged to someone who wasn&#39;t you. Would you tell that person that they deserved to go to <em>Hell</em> for what they had done? Would you tell them they don&#39;t deserve a drop of the happiness they ever get to experience for the rest of their life? Would you tell them nothing will ever wash away the stain of what they&#39;ve done? Would you, Luka, look another living person in the eye and say those things to them if they told you how they made a mistake when they didn&#39;t know any better?&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Thursday, March 24, 2022 1:07 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He&#39;d forgiven Jaska every foul thing he&#39;d done to get back at him. Preemptively forgiven him for anything he would do later on. &quot;I just... I wish there was a resolution. I don&#39;t want this strife between me and Jaska to continue to upset Valentine. I want to be part of Axa&#39;s life. I want to call her my niece. I want to see Jaska flourish in the business enterprise he&#39;s building and be able to toast his success over a glass of wine. I want the four of us to spend holidays together, to be a family. And the reason it&#39;s not is because of the choices I made. I can&#39;t not feel shame over that. And that&#39;s not even touching on the fact that... I hurt him. Deeply.

Luka turned his hand over so he could wrap his fingers around Skena&#39;s. &quot;I see them in every glimpse of insecurity that crosses his face, in every defiant need to prove himself. I see them in how natural violence comes to him, and how much he tries to be self sufficient. I see them in how he...&quot; Luka choked slightly. &quot;In how he protects Axa from me.

What if he never forgives you? What if he hangs onto a grudge out of petty spite? You can&#39;t allow him to have that control over you where that then ruins your ability to move forward. You&#39;ve done everything that could be asked of you. You&#39;ve opened the door to welcoming him into your desire to apologize and heal, but you can&#39;t force him over that threshold. Whether or not he seeks that repair process with you <em>has nothing to do with you</em>. Luka... <em>you deserve to be happy</em>. Nothing you have told me makes me think anything otherwise. You&#39;re such a pure creature and you&#39;ve overflowing with empathy for others, empathy for those who don&#39;t even give you the time of day.

She squeezed his hand again, as if she could push her words into him through that little pressure. &quot;This world chews up and spits out soft, kind people,&quot; she continued, her voice soft. &quot;It happened to me. It happened to Kaleva. It&#39;s not your fault that your kindness and trust was taken advantage of. You only ever intended for good things to happen as a result of your actions, from the sound of it.

&quot;... If it makes you feel less inappropriate for sharing... I told you I was exiled, but not what for. My temple considered certain acts of necromancy to be sacrilege. It... It seems a silly thing to say now, when I&#39;m... reasonably confident, for the first time in a long time, that my god doesn&#39;t... actually care. But for a long time, it&#39;s eaten me alive.&quot;

Her gaze was down on her plate as she delicately picked off another bite of potato with her fork. &quot;The scars I mentioned to you... those come from over a decade ago, when I first lived with Kaleva. That was in Cautica, where my temple was. Where my whole life had been at that time, and would continue to be for the next ten years. The Head Priest who raised me was... like a father to me. But he... he loved me selfishly, I think.&quot; She spoke in a careful tone that made it seem like she... maybe had not fully come to terms with that. &quot;I was no longer of value to him when I lost my halo. But a decade before that happened, he decided he did not like Kaleva&#39;s influence on me. Mind you,&quot; she added with a soft, almost sad smile, &quot;Kaleva&#39;s influence was simply one that encouraged me to... I don&#39;t know. Be happy. Not even to rebel. Just to be happy.&quot; She shook her head a little.

&quot;When Oberon tried to talk me into parting with him, I... I had a... reaction, that I still don&#39;t fully understand. I&#39;ve since come to think it was something similar to what certain kinds of aasimar experience, where they burn with holy fire. But mine was always... mutated. Volatile. It burned <em>me</em>, causing horrible burns and scorch marks that were practically tattooed into my flesh. Unchecked, I think I could have unintentionally killed myself by simply staying in that state for too long. Oberon quickly backed down as he... watched his crown jewel damage itself. And... I didn&#39;t realize it at the time, or for any of the years that followed, but... I think he chose to approach his dilemma indirectly next. Kaleva was suddenly framed for a murder that he most certainly did not commit, and set to be tried. And... trials in Cautica are morbid affairs. It&#39;s practically synonymous with execution. When I became aware of what was happening, I threw myself into the coliseum arena with him, and fought off his executor until his sentence was lessened to exile. I didn&#39;t see him again after that, not until I left the city in my own exile a decade later. But... I had to stay presentable. So the temple healers cleaned up what they could of my face and hands. The rest of my body is still a mess. My back most of all; when the Arbiter landed a killing blow across my back, it was... only by the grace of divine intervention that it not only did not kill me, but shattered his hammer on impact.&quot; She gave a slightly awkward little smile. 

&quot;Given how little mass I had to begin with... I think I&#39;m half comprised of scar tissue by now.&quot; 

Sucking in a deep breath, she sighed it out again. &quot;So... there. Now we&#39;ve both been inappropriate.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She was starting to fill up, despite having only made her way through about half a potato. &quot;I do earnestly appreciate it.

Kaleva smirked at that, and Luka flashed him a grin. But then Skena&#39;s words sank in and he blinked. &quot;Wait, what does Jaska need an on-call healer for? Is he alright?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I don&#39;t think he&#39;s necessarily <em>fond</em> of me or considers me a friend, but he certainly put himself in harm&#39;s way to ensure I stayed safe the other day.

Luka blinked at her, and from the furrow of his brow, the quietly worried and distressed look on his face, it was safe to say he saw through her attempt at evasion. But he didn&#39;t seem hurt or upset by it, and even gave her a small smile. &quot;I&#39;m glad you are able to look out for one another. Truly. Jaska may not know much about how to have friends, but he does know how to look out for his own. And if he needs to turn to anyone, I&#39;m glad he has you.&quot;

&quot;Excellent.&quot; Luka rose up and retrieved the box of torte, opening it up. &quot;I can dish it out if you don&#39;t mind me helping myself to the plates and cutlery.&quot; At Kaleva&#39;s nod and instructions, he got the required plates and cut each of them a slice, setting a piece out for each of them. The torte was quite rich, chocolate cake and hazelnut frosting mixed with layers of buttercream. The kind of decadence that was sure to make any Skena swoon.

&quot;So I&#39;ve learned quite a bit about Skena and her hobbies, and I know you are a skilled carpenter and painter. What other sorts of things interest you, Kaleva?&quot;

The dark-skinned tiefling paused briefly as he savored a bite of the torte, thinking and shrugging slightly. &quot;I like dogs. Canines in general. I like living off the land. Hunting, fishing, foraging.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Kaleva blinked a bit at that. Most people just tended to blanket sled dogs and not ask about the specific breeds, and he found himself tentatively offering up more information. &quot;Depends on how many I can handle at one time, but i&#39;d like to get a breeding pair of samoyeds, huskies, and malamutes. At some point I might risk heading back up north to Selvagr to see if I can locate a pair of kugsha. Like the Cautican hound, they&#39;re a rare breed and native only to that area. But I&#39;d either need to find someone to purchase them for me, or find a means of disguising myself... They are outright hostile toward tieflings and will kill them on sight in most cases. I&#39;d prefer to go myself so I can select my own, but...&quot; He shrugged helplessly.

Luka thoughtfully chewed on a bite, thinking. &quot;There are amulets that exist that can give you a human appearance, in addition to temporary spells. The amulet would be more reliable though. I&#39;ll keep an eye out for one if you like, or have Valentine look into where you can purchase one. She&#39;s quite talented at locating things like that.

Kaleva let out a low whistle, and Luka nodded slowly. &quot;Interestingly enough? When Jaska got his own body, he lost access to all his spells as a warlock. Or, I guess... <em>my</em> spells.

&quot;Well. More power to her, then. What an accomplishment. I certainly hope it remains as nonthreatening as it sounds like things currently are.

They&#39;re a bit bigger than knives. And blood magic works best up close.&quot;

&quot;Blood magic?&quot; Luka asked curiously. &quot;You&#39;re a blood hunter, then?&quot;

&quot;Mhm. I&#39;ve been assigned to work with the guild in Fielbarry to help on some of their more dangerous expeditions.&quot;

Luka took another nibble of the layered cake, gold eyes doing a rather poor job at disguising their curiosity. &quot;Admittedly I know very little about blood hunters. What sort of magic can you do?&quot;

The tip of Kaleva&#39;s tail flicked slightly under the table, but he kept a fairly neutral expression. &quot;I use my blood to imbue my blades with elemental energy. Either fire or frost currently. There are also various curses I can afflict - as long as the target in question has blood. But even if they don&#39;t, I can amplify the magic to force it on them. For example, I can make them bloat up to where they injure themselves if they try moving too fast, or I can sear a brand on someone and be able to locate them like a compass, always knowing the direction they&#39;re in, and they&#39;ll sustain damage automatically if they attack me or anyone by my side.&quot;

&quot;Fascinating! It sounds like quite the versatile craft.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Though… on the note of things being a secret for good reasons… just so I can rest easy that I’ve explicitly stated it, I trust you to not repeat the details of my past.

&quot;... What I said earlier, about... devils and angels, and what they are being an intrinsic aspect of who they are. None of that is true for mortals,&quot; she murmured gently. &quot;How one is or is not nurtured makes a world of difference when it comes to mortals. If Axa <em>were</em> mortal, not the categorical fiend that she actually is, then I would be a strong believer that it doesn&#39;t matter that she began her life literally in Hell. No matter what her experiences there were, I would have no doubt in my mind that now that she has healthy, unconditional love and parental guidance and protection, she would grow to be an equally healthy woman capable of just as much compassion and mercy and gentility as someone without her origins.&quot; 

She hitched a shoulder a little. &quot;Jaska is mortal. Despite his... extremely unusual creation, beginning life as practically a teratoma, I have no reason to believe he is not capable of becoming anyone at all, given enough time and nurturing. If Luka&#39;s story is accurate--and I have no reason to doubt him--this is all... relatively fresh events. Unless, after diverging from his host brother, Jaska was perfectly fine for a while, and then something <em>else</em> happened to cause his deteriorating condition--then I have a rough idea of when that divergence happened based on when I became involved. And... I&#39;m not the most active in town, but I certainly never saw Jaska prior to that time. Which means, despite how he must <em>strain</em> to present himself as collected and in control... he&#39;s only <em>barely</em> just begun to get his feet under him. Why <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> he still have a lot of paranoia stirred to the surface that hasn&#39;t had a chance to settle down yet?&quot; She shook her head, absentmindedly folding up the dish towel as she concluded drying everything. 

&quot;I guess... what I&#39;m trying to say, I think, is that it feels too early to judge him. I think, in this extremely unique situation, I&#39;m reasonably confident saying he could still become anyone at all.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

They&#39;re <em>fascinating</em>. It&#39;s a type of tumor, but it&#39;s unusual in that it&#39;s comprised of... how do I put this...&quot;

She leaned against the counter, staring up at the ceiling. &quot;... So on your scalp, you have little cells and follicles and all that stuff that&#39;s designed to grow hair. Your whole body is kind of mapped out like that; your scalp knows to grow hair, wheres your mouth knows to grow teeth, and your fingers know to grow fingernails. Just like your scalp knows <em>not</em> to grow teeth or fingernails. But sometimes, little cells from one area will end up somewhere else, and they&#39;ll do the only thing they know how to do, which is to grow the things they&#39;re meant to grow. But something&#39;s gone wrong for them to end up somewhere they shouldn&#39;t be, so the result is a mass that grows like a tumor, except... if you surgically remove it, you&#39;ll find it&#39;s comprised of all these pieces of anatomy mottled together that look... a little bit like if you put random bodyparts in a blender. In simpler terms, it&#39;s a tumor that can have hair, teeth, and tissues that, when examined microscopically, should belong to distinct parts of the body which this tumor is most certainly not. Even muscles and bones. There&#39;s even cases--absolutely <em>wild</em> cases--where this same anomaly will result in entire <em>limbs or digits</em> growing where the shouldn&#39;t. Sometimes completely internally. So you only realize it&#39;s a teratoma when you do surgery to remove the mass, and find that--<em>oh</em>, it has fingers.&quot;

She spoke like it was a wonderful, enchanting story. Like she was telling a whimsical tale about fairies or something. &quot;Jaska wasn&#39;t actually a teratoma, because teratomas are a bunch of confused cells--but not their own living creatures at all. Similar to how a cancerous tumor--which teratomas can sometimes be--is not a creature. It&#39;s a tumor. That said, the way Luka described how their patron initially tried to separate them by mutating new growths all over and inside of Luka&#39;s body... it reminded me of teratomas. An eyeball in a brain is not something I&#39;ve heard of in regards to teratoma cases, but it does make me wonder if such a thing could happen naturally, outside of the influence of an insidious patron entity.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
