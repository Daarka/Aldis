The sky was painted in brilliant red that faded into indigo, beautiful for all that the landscape was harsh and unforgiving.

Like something out of a picture book, an oasis could be found nearby. Apricot and fig trees provided hope for sustenance, and also provided shade from the sun. But it seemed the little haven was occupied by someone already, a single tent set up and the makings of a fire ready to go, but not yet lit.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

For any particularly traveled individuals, it was a semi-distinct sound; not from a heavy animal, but a lithe horse bred for traversing the desert. In the dying light, there was a faint glint of dying sunlight as horse and rider came into sight. 

It was a slender, buckskin horse, its coat almost bearing a metallic sheen, and its mane shaven to leave an almost vaguely serpentine profile against the sand. The rider was small, and bundled in lightweight but concealing black clothes. Not typically ideal colors for navigating a desert... but to those familiar with the native culture, black was a sacred color. One of life and purity. 

And chances are, this rider was, if not a native, at least familiar with the deserts of Cautica, as an--also black--scarf and veil wrapped around their head and face, only two glints of golden pupils visible from their natural anatomy. Garb to fend off blowing sand and merciless sunburn, as did the rest of the outfit.

The horse was reined in as the rider spotted the tent, a few blinks and a squint as they tried to assess the scene; it wasn&#39;t sufficient justification for passing over the oasis for the night, provided there were no signs of hostility.

His skin was a rich copper brown, his hair straight, fine, black as sin, and hanging down to his lower back. He was dressed in loose, breezy clothing well suited to the desert, black with gold accents, and a loose hood around his shoulders.

As he turned to look at Skena, pitch black eyes gazed back at her, no visible sclera, iris, or pupil. Just bottomless black pits that seemed to reject the light. His features were clean shaven and chiseled, with high cheekbones and a wide mouth that stretched into a slow smile as he spotted the rider.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Skena frowned a little beneath her veil, not liking the odd sensation that prickled at the back of her skull as she laid eyes on this man. It had nothing to do with his appearance; that was barely given a second thought. Something else, related to none of her bodily senses, received him differently. And unpleasantly. 

Regardless, she was still nothing if not cordial to a fault. Trying her luck first with commontongue, she called out a gentle, &quot;Good evening... are you comfortable with company?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There are figs and apricots available, and the water is clean enough.&quot;

There was something a bit odd about his voice. It... flanged, slightly. Like he had two vocal chords producing sound out of a single mouth. He stepped back, turning to walk to the fire and sit beside it, one leg tucked under while the other stretched around to frame it, reaching over to pick up one of the apricots he&#39;d gathered earlier, turning it over in his hands.

&quot;What is your name?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She led the horse over to the water, where it readily bowed its head to drink, and she dropped the reins, reaching to pull her own supplies off its back. With them, something dropped down into the sand at her feet--and then promptly scurried off into the reeds. 

Still keeping the man in her line of sight, she set the bundle that would become her own camp down on the ground, considering his question a moment. 

&quot;... I&#39;m not particularly comfortable giving it, if you don&#39;t mind,&quot; she replied softly after a moment. Not this close to home. &quot;I understand if that makes you disinclined to share your own.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;You seem to be traveling alone, and I can understand how that would invoke a sense of caution. Nevertheless, that is no reason for me to be rude.

In fact... she made the cinch a little snug again. Just slightly. 

&quot;A Cautican name,&quot; she commented lightly, moving over to the bundle of tent and bedroll and such and beginning to unstrap it, though still bundled up in her traveling garb herself. &quot;Do you live here? At this oasis?&quot;

The name was probably a coincidence.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The large quantities of fruits could be explained easily, but that was also a rather large amount of meat being made into jerky. Like he&#39;d hunted some manner of large animal.

Skena blinked at the offering, hesitating only a moment before reaching out to accept it with a nod. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she murmured politely, that prickle in her skull getting a bit more prominent the closer she moved towards him. It was like... a taste or a scent, though it belonged to none of her bodily senses. But something felt uncannily... familiar? about his presence. Not in a way that was comforting, but also not decidedly alarming. Just... familiar. Recognizable, perhaps. 

She gently set the packaged food aside (to be inspected for anything suspicious later), returning to finishing up pitching her small tent. &quot;I regret to say that for as much of my life as I spent in this desert, I never exactly had the chance to explore it as you describe. I&#39;m sure there is much of interest and beauty to be found there. It sounds as though it holds your interest sufficiently, too. Perhaps makes you happy? Or would you prefer the home you lost, given the choice?&quot; A beat.

&quot;--You do not have to answer that if I am being too forward.&quot; She was very intrigued, but had to remind herself this was a stranger in the middle of empty desert who may not feel like spilling his life&#39;s story to her.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

What things he had of value were kept on his person, and they were few. The most visible was a single piece of jewelry around his neck. A bolo tie - a black leather cord with silver tips and a silver pendant that Skena&#39;s closer proximity would reveal to show a large garnet framed by a pair of was-scepters engraved into the silver.

&quot;I do not mind your questions,&quot; he replied with a smile, taking the now-packaged foods back to his tent to pack them away securely. &quot;I enjoyed my home and my life, while it was available to me. I was quite ambitious, and had big dreams. But dreams do not always so easily become reality, and my hubris was eventually punished. For a while I thought of returning, but...&quot;

Achoris tipped his head back, squinting up at the darkening sky in thought. &quot;I suppose I outgrew the idea. The more I explored and the more I learned, the smaller and more insignificant Cautica became.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Settling down to sit on the end of the bedroll, she allowed herself a moment to relax, turning her full attention back to the other man. The other aasimar. The other aasimar without a halo.

&quot;I sometimes wonder if there is truly a type of person fit to be a child of divinity, or if it is fundamentally flawed as a concept. Though, admittedly, I only am aware of a small handful of accounts. A very small handful. Perhaps they are outliers; I cannot say.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He looked back to her with a curious tilt to his head, one brow raised. &quot;I cannot say for certain. I knew of no others during my time, though I had heard of a small handful in the past, and rumors of another one popping up in the Temple of Anubis a while ago. Which is an odd and interesting concept in itself, because that would make me akin to an uncle... Though Cusai deity family trees are tangled things.&quot;

Shrugging, he went about taking out some matches to get the fire started in the rapidly fading light. &quot;Either way, I do not regret my experiences.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Every beat, every little idiosyncrasy in his mannerisms. Things she always paid attention to, but currently had her undivided attention. 

There was a moment of silence there, before she stirred into motion again. Reaching in the pile of her belongings for her water skin, and finally moving to unwrap the veil and hood from her face and head. Stark white became immediately visible as her flesh was uncovered, sunken and gaunt features resembling those of a pallid corpse. And her eyes, not unlike Achoris&#39;, only differed in their golden pupils. Perhaps it was the gods&#39; way of equipping them with eyes that would have an easier time in the desert sun... though Skena still drew the short stick there, as the rest of her anatomical composition seemed to counter any benefit blackened eyes would have given her. But in the dying light, her complexion at least didn&#39;t seem <em>illuminated</em> the way it otherwise might have.

With her face now uncovered, she indulged in a small drink, keeping Achoris in her periphery as she looked across the oasis thoughtfully. &quot;... I must admit, I&#39;m curious to hear your story from your own lips. Gods know the way my own has surely been warped by those still in the city.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Well met.&quot; He dipped his chin in return, settling in in front of the fire in a relaxed, seated position. &quot;I actually started off as an acolyte in the temple of Set. I joined them when I was a teenager. But I was determined to be more than that, to show my dedication and devotion to the teachings of Set, and eventually was welcomed as a Son of Divinity. It did take quite a bit of convincing, admittedly. Being born of two fathers is not exactly something that is commonplace. But the lore clearly states that Set had given birth before, and they eventually accepted.&quot;

He pulled out a black stone pipe from his inner pocket along with a little leather wallet of dried herbs, scooping the bowl of the pipe into the herbs and packing it in, lighting it with a stick from the growing fire. A puff to start the embers burning, and he continued with his story, smoke curling out of his mouth as he spoke. &quot;I craved the attention, the renown. I take after Set in that fashion. I wanted power and influence. Eventually I took over the running of the temple, because who better to run a temple of Set than the son of Set himself? Who better than the one who heard Set&#39;s voice in his dreams?&quot;

The embers from the fire lit up his coppery skin, but his black eyes reflected none of it. As if someone had painted his eyes vanta black, they were like bottomless pits. &quot;But there is a plateau one reaches as head of a temple. Especially in a city shared by so many other gods. I sought more power. I wanted the entire city to kneel in worship at my feet, and I could not make them do so the way I was. So I started researching. First making friends and connections in the temple of Thoth to try to gain access to their libraries, and then sending my own acolytes out to other places. Eventually I found what I was looking for - a way to gain the power I sought by entering into a pact with an otherworldly being. And the moment I sealed the pact, I also sealed my fall from the grace of Set.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Finally, she broke eye contact, her gaze wandering thoughtfully over the sand again. &quot;... I have not heard Set&#39;s voice. I do not know him the way you do. The way I know Anubis.

What is wood but the corpse of a tree? Cut and polished and stained and sealed in a lacquer that staves off decay. The herbs you pack it with are burnt for your own consumption instead of allowing them to be decomposed by snails and worms on a forest floor. Even the head dresses I wore in ceremonies at the temple, the skulls of jackals--all prevented from their natural process of decay so they could serve our uses. Mankind cannot exist as it does without stubbornly denying decomposition what it craves. There are more corpses of lives gone by surrounding us than we realize. If it is unnatural, then the temple would look down upon linen, upon leather, upon anything that was once living. So to animate a corpse, to use it as a conduit for one&#39;s magic--how is that different? It could only deviate from Anubis&#39; dogma if it dragged souls back from the afterlife. But I do not possess that ability. I shape flesh, I can puppet lifeless matter. I cannot pluck a soul back from beyond the scales and affix it within a vessel again.

A slow smile spread as some dark, cold emotion passed across his features. &quot;Perhaps that&#39;s why they were so quick to exile me.

Black shadows seemed to wrap around his form in a dark mist, swirling around him in a shroud, and from his back emerged a pair of skeletal, ghostly wings. Scraps of skin and tattered feathers hung from the bones like shredded fabric, the appendages arching up and out from his body.

Skena watched in quiet fascination, something else prickling at her skin now. Something empathetic, something that knew what those shadows tasted like on her skin, even sitting out of their reach. There was no fear in her gaze, though. If he expected any from her at his appearance, his abnormalities, the things that made him less than human, he would be sorely disappointed. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry you lost your ability to fly,&quot; she replied gently. &quot;But... they&#39;re still beautiful, in a way. But perhaps that&#39;s because I&#39;ve spent a great deal of my life finding beauty in bones.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She briefly followed his gaze to the horse, before looking back towards him with a nod. &quot;I have no interest in harming you,&quot; she replied easily, the words earnest. Did he think her the type? Oh well. She&#39;d known more cautiously paranoid people than that.

Picking herself up, she moved to refill her water skin, taking the opportunity to rinse her hands and face off as well. &quot;Goodnight, then, Achoris,&quot; she murmured cordially, though not coldly.

A couple of old, musty-looking tomes written in Abyssal. Some coin, maybe about twenty gold&#39;s worth. It all seemed perfectly modest and normal.

There was a brief transfer of unspoken information, before she rose to her feet and moved back over to the horse, delicately loosening its cinch again. Just... slightly. The saddle still remained on, and the reins were kept over the horse&#39;s head. Just in case. But the animal wasn&#39;t tied down, allowed to freely wander the oasis; it wouldn&#39;t leave when there was food and water here. And nowhere else nearby.

She then headed back to her own tent and crawled inside, that little prickle still irritating the back of her skull. She stared up at the interior of her tent with a gentle frown, processing the events of the evening, but ultimately curling up to attempt to get some rest. Or, rather, to begin to settle her mind down by shifting into her minion&#39;s senses and following along with what he was doing as he picked through the surprisingly lush oasis vegetation to see if there were any little corpses to gather up.

So it was promising when he caught the scent of decay, and he trotted his way in that direction, sniffing along the dirt. But there was no animal carcass, not even a splatter of blood in the sand. Just... freshly turned soil. Gummy assessed the obstacle for a moment, and then, not giving it much thought (if he was even capable of doing so), squared up on his haunches and began to dig. He was already a good way down before it clicked for Skena that this was not something that some jackal or the like had buried to stash for later. It was too deep for that. And... 

She instructed Gummy to stop. To get out of the little hole he had started, and sniff around the area more. And that scent of decay was seeped into the ground in... a much larger area than would have belonged to some jackal&#39;s kill. 

Gummy was instructed to return to her, and Skena pulled out of his senses with a tight sigh, shifting to pull a dagger from its sheath on her waist so she could curl up with it tucked flat against her chest. Just in case.

Gummy returned to the tent, but did not crawl inside of it. Instead, he found a shrub nearby, and slipped into hiding there, his unblinking eyes staring out between the two tents, not about to miss anything that happened throughout the night.

Just in case.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But as nothing concerning happened, she woke naturally on her own accord at dawn, easing into consciousness as the morning&#39;s heat began to coax its way into the sands.

She was still cold. She was always cold. But that warmth was still appreciated.

The dagger had remained tucked against her chest all night, as she had spent the entirety of the night in the exact position she had fallen asleep in, never stirring or shifting, or really showing any signs of life at all. Rising from her temporary grave, she delicately sheathed the dagger again, taking a moment to assess the world outside her tent through Gummy&#39;s senses, before returning to her own and pushing out into the open air. She covered her mouth as she yawned silently, arching her back in a modest stretch before heading over to the water opposite where Achoris was going about his morning business. She did not strip down for a bath herself, though she did top off her waterskin and cup water in her hands to bring up to her face, allowing droplets to seep between the roots of her hair where it would ward off the scalding pressure of the sun once the celestial body had climbed higher in the sky. Once this was completed, she sat back and wiped some of the loose droplets from her face with her sleeve, reaching into a pocket and producing a small something wrapped in some sort of wax paper. As her fingers began to unwrap it, she glanced over to the other aasimar, offering a cordial, &quot;... Good morning. How did you sleep?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Shirtless as he was, it showed at least that his unusually skinny, stretched appearance was natural and not due to being emaciated.

It wasn&#39;t her ideal breakfast, but honey could easily last the journey without any preservative measures, so she was embracing her inner hummingbird. 

It took a second, but then something occurred to her, and she tilted her head slightly at Achoris. &quot;... This may seem like a strange question,&quot; she ventured after chewing and swallowing, &quot;But are you prone to having a sweet tooth?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She had been easily listening along up until that word, and then something in her brain pulled the emergency brake. She didn&#39;t spend her whole life studying bodily sciences to not catch that very specific red flag. After all... even some burial practices included degrees of consumption. 

Squinting at him slightly, her finger shifted a tiny bit along the wax paper, a little subconscious flicker of a fidget.

&quot;... Is that the causation behind the five and a half foot corpse in a shallow grave on the east bank of the oasis?&quot;

So she pulled her messenger bag in her lap, rummaging a moment before producing a few things. A coil of some sort of wire with garrotes on either end, a slim scalpel, and a carving knife. Just your basic travelling supplies, really.

Her gloves, which she had donned again after breakfast, were slipped off once more; no need to get them dirty. Sleeves were rolled up, and with little further adieu, she took the garrotes and wrapped the wire once around the woman&#39;s left wrist, leveraging her body against the corpse with practiced motions and beginning to saw her hand off with surprising competency, given her waifish structure making it seem like such brutish work would be beyond her.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Hands, feet, some vertebrae, teeth. Maybe a couple ribs. The full rib cage, pelvis, or skull, I don&#39;t think would be practical to take, though they&#39;d be useful. Likewise with most of the limbs.&quot;

As she spoke, the garrote was set aside and her bare hands, not looking dissimilar from the corpse beneath them, began to deftly work their fingers along the dismembered hand, pinching the exposed bone at the wrist stump and beginning to slide upwards. The flesh was pushed along the way--sliding off the bone with unnatural ease. The woman had not been dead nearly long enough for her soft tissues to slough off her bones in such a way, but as if nimbly working a clay sculpture, Skena gradually went about doing just that. 

&quot;They can serve a variety of uses. Raw material that I can shape into anything. Conduits for my magic, sometimes in the way of weapons. Offerings that allow me access to certain magics. I can find infinite uses for it all.&quot; She tilted her head in a small gesture towards Gummy, who was hard at work gnawing on the woman&#39;s opposite wrist. It was slower work than the bone saw wire had been, but by god he was getting it done. 

&quot;He is comprised solely of such harvested material, for instance.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I don&#39;t actually know where, if at all, you would fall in that.&quot;

She turned back to her gory task, flicking the last of the meat off what was now an almost pristine skeletal hand, the bones stitched together with what sinew remained. &quot;I never knew my mother and father. Never had the opportunity to ask them where or how Anubis entered my ancestry. The man who raised me in the temple--if he was privy to that sort of information, he never shared it with me. And I&#39;d be content to never cross paths with him again, so the information would be lost to me if that were the case. For all I know, I am what I am because some great-great-great grandparent rose to some manner of sainthood under my God. Granted, the temple always told me I was <em>descended</em> from Him, so... if I&#39;m going by that, then yes, I carry His blood. But I... honestly don&#39;t know how truthful they were with me anymore.&quot; She shrugged a little.

&quot;Even if that is the case, I have no way of knowing where exactly He is located in my family tree, so... I suppose, if I was descended from Him, and you from Set, then... technically speaking, we could be anything from directly uncle and niece to something similar, but countless generations removed. It&#39;s... I suppose it&#39;s rather moot to me. &#39;Family&#39; has always been a strange matter in my life. I have no one in my life I am tied to by blood in that manner, so family has always been defined by the actions of loved ones instead of labels. I&#39;m afraid the traditional concept of familial bonds is more alien to me than I would like it to be.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He picked a bit of grit out from beneath a nail, eyes half-lidded. &quot;My father told me of Set, told me that Set had given me to him to raise among the mortals. He didn&#39;t speak often of his relationship with Set, though he was one of His clerics. And lovers, apparently, on occasion. I tried asking him about it when I was a teenager, but I was simply told it was an experience beyond description, and to try to describe it would be to lessen it.&quot; Achoris shrugged his shoulders easily. &quot;In any case, Set&#39;s favor wasn&#39;t the only one whose favor I lost when I fell. Father took it as some personal failing on his part, turned to drink, and died a few years later in a drunken accident involving a roof and a long fall. Maybe it was intentional, I&#39;ll never know.

&quot;... My condolences for your loss. I am... likely spared such grief having never known my parents directly. But... I still find myself wishing I did. Even though I wonder what new pains that knowledge would bring me. I can&#39;t help but want it. All I know is that my mother gave me to the temple as an infant.

She let the words hang in the air a moment, before continuing, &quot;But I wish you no harm. And I do not believe you any less deserving of peace and compassion than my closest loved ones. All of that is true even before adding the variables of whatever kinship exists between you and I, either by blood, by race, or by uniquely common backgrounds and experiences.

With that, she looked back towards the corpse in front of her and resumed carefully removing teeth. &quot;Mine is a God of death, but He is not a God of demise.

I am averse to passing judgement. I am not the one who should dictate what someone does or does not deserve, or who they are allowed to be. I don&#39;t think any mortal can truly be that voice--how in the world could we know what we&#39;re talking about? We can guess, we can philosophize, but we are all flawed and biased in the end.&quot; She exhaled a short breath; perhaps the ghost of what might have almost been dry amusement. 

&quot;I do not claim to speak for Anubis. There has only ever been one time in which I felt I could, and... even then, I deferred to being his sword rather than his voice. And only because I felt him behind me, felt him taking every step alongside me, felt him filling me with such surety in my actions that it very nearly drowned out any other thoughts I could have possibly had in those moments.&quot; Her movements slowed slightly for a few seconds... before gradually resuming their work. 

&quot;But I digress. The Gods and their values and motivations are, in many ways, as varied as those of mortals. I know how I decide to live my own life, but I am not so rigid and self-absorbed in that dogma to assume that such a lifestyle would be best for everyone else I encounter, too. Even my best friend is... mm. Uncannily similar to myself in many ways, but... a polar opposite in just as many more. And...&quot; This time she did give a tiny snort, lips twitching in a small, sentimental smile, &quot;... Forgive me, I have lied to you; There have been <em>two</em> times I have felt I could speak for my God. The second is in knowing beyond any shadow of a doubt that Anubis embraced him, despite all his differences to myself. There is no one singular &#39;correct&#39; way to exist in this world.&quot;

She glanced over her shoulder again. &quot;Which is all to say that... perhaps complicated chaos suits you. Perhaps there is, in a divine and existential sense, nothing wrong with that at all.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I rather imagine that my heart will be akin to dropping a lead ball on Anubis&#39; Scales when my time comes, but part of me is curious as to where He stands on my dietary habits. I can exist without consuming the flesh of sentient peoples, I&#39;ve proven that, uncomfortable and miserable as it may be.

&quot;You do not strike me as the kind of soul that feels damned. I barely know you, and I could very well be horribly mistaken.

&quot;Of course, whatever other sins you may carry are a different matter. But also one that is neither my business nor my concern.

She didn’t answer immediately; when she did, it was with none of the surety of her prior affirmations.

“… I don’t know,” she admitted quietly. “I wish I had answers to… to even one of those questions.”

The silence stretched for a moment as she lost herself to her thoughts, the look on her face one of the most vulnerable Achoris had seen thus far. Finally, she spoke again. “… When I was cast out from the temple, I spent that first night on the streets in Cautica. That… stupid city was my whole life. I didn’t know what to do, and… everything I cared about had just been reduced to ash. When I slept—I was so afraid to sleep. I was braced for the kind of reprimand my… my adoptive father had given me. But even worse, because it would be at the hands of a God. <em>My</em> God. And as much as I lived by my human guardian’s approval, I feared the disapproval of my God a thousand fold more. But He didn’t scold me. I guess I was right to expect a dream from Him, but it was…” She faltered, squinting off at nothing.

“… Gentle. Compassionate. Not in the way a parent would redirect a child for having misbehaved, just in a patient and calm tone. No, I—I didn’t get any sense of redirection at all. There was no acknowledgement of my supposed wrongdoings. No sense of disapproval. No sense that anything was different at all. He simply… guided me to where I needed to be. He showed me how to find independence. How to be okay without the life I had known. And even now, when I reach for Him, He’s there. As surely as He ever has been.”

A beat. “But there’s still ice in my chest that never thaws. My halo is gone. I don’t know if more has changed that I’m not even aware of, because I’ve… never really, truly had a firm grasp on every part of who I am. Or what’s normal for me. But if not for those changes, I wouldn’t assume myself fallen. Anubis hasn’t wavered. Has never expressed discontent with my—I mean, the necromancy hasn’t <em>stopped</em> in the slightest,” she said, gesturing to the grave she was actively robbing and the undead minion assisting her. “But I’ve never heard even a whisper against it from Him. Yet when the man I had considered my father all my life cast me out for such things, the warmth left my body and never returned. But he’s—he was just a human man.” She finally turned her gaze back towards Achoris, a certain helplessness on her face—hoping he would have insight without truly expecting he would. “How could a human man, not even of my own blood, not even—not even a <em>saint</em> in my God’s name… how could <em>his</em> disapproval have felled me?” She asked, some of her bewildered, frustrated misery seeping her mostly rhetorical question in hints of earnest distress.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I would imagine if such a thing can be undone, it would require a similarly intense event. Or a prolonged state of healing.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

If she noticed the changes, she showed no sign of it, mindlessly wiping her face on her sleeve, before turning that empty gaze miserably out towards the desert again. Managing to process Achoris&#39; words, she gave a tiny shake of her head.

His head tilted, and a wry half-smile turned his lips.

&quot;That is... extremely clever, actually. Unintentional or not. They didn&#39;t want to let you go, so you threw away your halo and everything about you that they coveted so you could finally be free to live your own life.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I still <em>love</em> him,&quot; she whispered, the words carrying an unsettling, haunting echo to them--one she didn&#39;t seem to take notice of, despite it being impossible to miss. Perhaps, though, not quite so unsettling to someone like her partner in conversation. &quot;I-I wish I didn&#39;t.&quot;

Her gazes snapped back to Achoris then--all of them. Somewhere in a confusing blink of a moment, at least a dozen pairs of empty black eyes had sprouted open across her face, her neck--even one or two on the backs of her hands. Wherever her stark flesh was visible, it had seemingly been split into eyelids for the new features. 

&quot;I don&#39;t know how to stop.&quot; Every word, beyond just their haunting echo, was strangled in a desperate effort to keep herself together. Every second that ticked by made it more and more evident that she had never done anything but bury these wounds out of sight; something about Achoris&#39; simple suggestions had managed to directly drag them back into the desert sun&#39;s light. &quot;I pray all the time that the Gods would let me stop loving him.&quot; Even the edges of her form seemed to be spilling a silent sort of black essence that tumbled down towards the sand around her like smoke from dry ice--not unlike the shroud that had enveloped Achoris when he had presented his wings.

&quot;...Let yourself love him.&quot; The words almost sounded foreign coming out of his mouth, something distant in his own ethereally flanged voice. &quot;He is your father. He wronged you, yes. He betrayed you and let you down. Placed value and limits on a relationship that should have been unconditional and priceless. That is his failing, and not yours.&quot;

He forced himself to step back, as if tearing free from whatever magnetism drew him toward her, turning his gaze away and standing straight. &quot;That you love him even now shows that you understood what that relationship <em>should</em> have been.&quot; Achoris&#39; voice dropped, low and gravelly, then. &quot;His love was conditional.

But what could still be discerned of her expressions amidst the seraphic mutations was twisted in heartache. But not protest. Just the heartache of someone who did, actually, hear Achoris&#39; words this time, did process them, and found there was no solution that would cut her cleanly free of the pain.

Her jaw clenched again, and--even still, there was an uncomfortable shifting of those eyes. One would close, the skin sealing back to normalcy in that spot, just as flesh parted elsewhere to open a new eye. A chaotic, trypophobic nightmare that should have been hellish--but was potentially made worse by how deeply <em>celestial</em> the horror of it was.

She said nothing in reply, but there seemed to be some manner of acceptance somewhere in the landscape of eyes. She shakily sniffed, and--still in the echoed voice--croaked a very tired and weary, &quot;Why are you looking at me like that?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His face, and his large, wide eyes that were pools of empty blackness. All two dozen or so of them. 

Her yelp had her jolting to the side away from him, and in the same beat, he seemed to start as well, springing a foot or two into the air like her jolt had echoed through him. With that jarring shift, her own mutations rapidly began to bleed away, the inky smoke dissipating, and many eyes snapping shut and disappearing into her skin until only a small handful remained--all wide and trained on the equally mutated minion.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;It... only happened to me three times. They were the only times I&#39;d really ever been <em>angry</em>, I guess. The last time was that, um. The thing in the coliseum that I guess everyone in Cautica heard about.&quot; She sounded decidedly uncomfortable with that part. Shifting, she lifted a hand to begin to peel away the collar of her clothes, exposing her shoulder and twisting a little to make the back of it visible to Achoris. It was rather strange, the way her head, neck, collar, hands, arms--all were completely free of any blemishes, any marks at all; if not for the ugly nature of her skin and her gaunt build, her complexion would have been silky perfection, barely even showing evidence of possessing pores. 

But the back of her shoulder was a different story. It was positively knotted in gnarled scar tissue, though this limited perspective wasn&#39;t enough for Achoris to understand the overall patterning of the scar that would hint at its origin. 

&quot;The last time, it took the other clerics days of effort to erase the scars from my extremities, where people would see it. They were so exhausted by the time they had done so, and I was... very intolerant of being poked at further, so they left my torso untouched beyond simple healing. But the scars remained.&quot; A beat.

&quot;Granted, not... not all of those scars are from that fire. There was also a... a war hammer incident. Were it not for Anubis holding me, I have no doubt my story would have ended there, as a red smear on the arena ground.&quot; Another beat. &quot;Well. A... dark-brownish smear.&quot; Yet another beat. &quot;I&#39;ll spare us both the trouble and tell you now that you don&#39;t want to eat me, Achoris.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

If I went with you, helped you get whatever it was you were after, helped keep you safe... would you be willing to accompany me into Cautica?&quot; She winced a little. 

&quot;You&#39;re more than welcome to decline the offer, and I&#39;ll completely understand.

A slow, wide smile spread across his lips. &quot;Who knows... it might be fun to see what&#39;s changed and what&#39;s stayed the same since I left. Would you mind a brief pit stop to the Temple of Set?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Pretty unique? They were always marketed as only being available in the city, and now that I&#39;ve traveled a bit, I have to admit there seems to be some authenticity in that claim. Something about them having... maybe originated in Kaldaross? But... like the breeder relocated to Cautica. I&#39;m not sure. Anyways, it was... just less than a decade or so since they seemed to set up shop in the city, and I became aware of them not long after they did, since... well, desert dogs were all around me all the time.&quot;

She was quiet for a moment, the knife set aside so she could repeat the process of sloughing the flesh off the hand&#39;s bones in a way that she should not have been able to do so easily. &quot;... I guess I didn&#39;t really say much else about him, but... that tiefling friend. He lived with me for a year. It ended the day I bought him a puppy. It <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> have... he was... he was the happiest I&#39;d ever seen him. And that made me happier than I&#39;d ever been. He went out to buy supplies, and didn&#39;t come back. I eventually learned he had been arrested, pending trial in the coliseum for some random murder they were pinning to him. I saved his life, but they exiled him instead. He wasn&#39;t even able to take the puppy with him. I didn&#39;t see him again for ten more years, almost to the day.&quot;

She flicked a bit of viscera from the bones, effectively degloving the skeleton itself with her eyes down on her work, heavily lidded and almost a bit glazed over. &quot;... A lot has happened in ten years. For both of us. And he&#39;s... he&#39;s been chewed up and spit out by the world over and over again. His heart is... it&#39;s pure and beautiful. But the way he carries himself is different than it was before. He&#39;s been bled dry of optimism. He&#39;s back in my life, at least, and I&#39;m beyond grateful to have him back. I thank Anubis for showing me the way back to him often. But I just... I want to see him as happy as he was that day again. I want it to happen correctly this time. It... It feels like the biggest piece of all the broken pieces around me that hasn&#39;t yet been made right. That... That dog was always meant to be his, and he only knew her for an hour.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Well. Let’s see… Aedrenor is much greener than Cusai. More… temperate forests and plains and all that. And it actually snows in the winter, though not as bad as the far north. The people are… fine, I suppose. Varied, yet… typical. If that even makes sense. There’s still discrimination in some places, but… it varies. Some towns are pretty bad for that kind of thing, but… where my friend and I settled down is kind of a little melting pot in the center of the country. It’s a town called Fielbarry. It’s mostly the kind of town you just pass through on your way to other parts of the land, but the main thing about it is it’s home to the Valehunter’s Guild. Which is an organization of… adventurers, I suppose, who follow magical creatures to sources of aether concentrations so aether crystals can be harvested from those nodes. Most people in Aedrenor seem to have at least heard of the guild in passing, but I’m not terribly surprised it’s less familiar this far east.”

She gave a little shrug, wrapping her thin hood and veil back around her head as she talked; the material was light enough to scarcely even muffle her words. “Fielbarry is nothing like Cautica. For obvious reasons, but also just…” she sighed. “The coliseum, the manner in which my friend was framed for murder and ultimately exiled just because someone didn’t like him breathing the same air as the rest of us, even the ways you and I were cast out for our respective ‘errors’… a place like Fielbarry makes it all feel so barbaric. There are more <em>tieflings</em> in that town than I’ve ever seen together in one place before. And no one cares. They just walk around and live their lives the same as everyone else. <em>I</em> don’t even get stared at as much as I’m used to. Kaleva and I—oh, my friend’s name is Kaleva—when we reunited, not long after we traveled to Fielbarry and joined the guild. His line of occupation these days basically deployed him to the guild, and… I’m content to go where he goes. So I joined, too. I only have the coin to make this errand because of that income. But… as much as I miss the desert, Fielbarry is a lovely place. The acceptance in the atmosphere alone makes it worth everything else I miss of Cusai.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The details of its face, the carved eyes and the mouth, were set with gold, and gold bands wrapped around the shaft close to either end.

Grasping the sceptre in one hand, he began using it as a walking stick as he climbed up a dune. &quot;I can&#39;t deny the usefulness of communication magic, but I never bothered to learn it myself.

Speaking of, I think I&#39;m overdue to touch base with those back home...&quot;

She drifted off, falling silent as her attention shifted inward. A hand lifted from the reins to weave a simple but deliberate symbol through the air, golden shimmers of light lingering in a fleeting runic pattern before dissipating in the desert&#39;s breeze. She pushed her lifeforce out until she found the familiar thread of Kaleva&#39;s, somewhere in the fabric of the universe.

I think you would get along with him, at least in some capacity. You&#39;re both... somewhat similar in demeanor. Enough that I would hazard to guess you&#39;d be compatible, at least in casual interaction. But I digress; the yuan-ti is much more, ah... candid about the things he has eaten. And there is no mob after him. I believe there is a substantial difference between an individual who kills another creature for consumption due to dietary needs--and or perhaps cultural and racial significance, in the case of the yuan-ti--versus a psychopath who pursues cannibalism due to some craving to fulfill a dark fantasy or to sate some other manner of maladaptive personality. I would be lying to say I&#39;m completely comfortable with the idea either way, but... just because I have an almost problematic inclination towards mercy and dislike anything being killed--even if it is to sustain a predator&#39;s life--doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t respect the needs of the predator.

“My point was only that he doesn’t hide who and what he is, or how monstrous his people are.

Most of the shorter-lived races that would recognize him had died by this point, but there was always a chance that the elves or other longer-lived peoples who lived in the city might recognize him. Still, if he was nervous, it didn&#39;t show. He walked toward the city for the first time in about sixty years as though he had only passed this way yesterday. His was-scepter had disappeared from sight.

The sudden lack of movement from his companion had him pausing to look back toward her. &quot;...What is it you are afraid of?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Nonetheless, she turned her attention forward again, falling silent and motionless once more as her horse carried her to the gates. 

It was not a particularly restrictive city in who was allowed through the gates--though there were guards visibly posted. Being the capitol city that it was, however, Cautica was largely open to travelers striding through, with those on the road only really being stopped if something looked suspicious.

Which was not much consolation when this travelling party appeared to be an extremely long-limbed man of unknown race with his features concealed, and what might have been a child who was even more concealed. 

But they weren&#39;t stopped. Skena didn&#39;t realize until after they had passed through the gate that her fingers were trembling, and she took a moment to swallow the lump in her throat and dare to look around. 

The nostalgia was like a brutal kick in the gut. What should have tasted sweet and soft instead made her feel miserable, almost threatening tears. There was an undeniable part of her that would always love and miss everything now before her eyes... yet it had become so poisoned with trauma. And something about the open, breezy, warm desert air felt suffocating.

She waited until they were a fair ways into the city, before a faint croak left her, just loud enough to reach her partner. &quot;Shall we head to your destination first...?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Halting her horse, she dismounted, delicately sliding the reins over the mare&#39;s head to lead her as they walked. She didn&#39;t like being up so tall, especially when she was trying to go unnoticed. 

She took the lead at that point, carefully navigating through the streets, following her memory of roads she had walked hundreds of times before. They moved away from the main roads, the busier shops, away from even the temples, and towards a farther portion of the city where buildings were more spaced out. She stopped outside the walls of what appeared to be a typical livestock-housing establishment, her demeanor still undeniably tense... but even still, a tiny, almost imperceptible glimmer of some sort of muted, childlike joy able to be glimpsed every so often. 

A little sheepishly, she handed her horse&#39;s reins towards Achoris. &quot;... Do you mind? It shouldn&#39;t take long.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

While Skena went inside to go look over the available puppies, he turned to the horse and studied it up close, reaching up a hand to rest his palm upon the velvety snout. After nearly ten minutes, he suddenly became aware that someone was approaching him... And just as he was about to summon his was-scepter, a hand clamped down on his upper arm, spinning him around to face an eladrin with skin the color of oxidized iron, a brown too red to be found on humans. He was shorter than Achoris by about a head, though still tall in his own right, with honey-amber eyes and dark emerald hair dappled with golden leaves, loosely tied back in a ponytail, bangs framing his face.

Achoris aborted his gesture upon recognizing the man, and a wide, toothy grin spread across his lips even as the man hissed, clearly unhappy, &quot;<em>What</em> are you <em>doing</em> here? Are you out of your mind?!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was a very happy little thing, but it had more leg than it knew what to do with. It was black, with more auburn-colored fur at various tips of the body, and big, honey-gold eyes. It stood half as tall as Skena did, which wasn&#39;t hugely uncommon for Cautican dogs--but its proportions all seemed stretched funny.

It kind of looked like a dog version of Achoris.

Except it didn&#39;t move with the understanding of its own wonky anatomy that Achoris had. As Skena reappeared and saw the new stranger, she slammed on the brakes, throwing off the dog&#39;s forward momentum as well and causing it to nearly trip over its own paws. But it recovered instantly, tail wagging and seeming wholly unfazed.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The closer Skena got, the eladrin&#39;s words might finally be made out. &quot;--knew that being out in the desert under that hot sun for years on end would finally fry your brain. You have finally lost your senses. Going to the temple of Set on top of that?! Achoris, they have <em>murals</em> on the walls in there with your face and proportions. You will <em>not</em> be able to set foot in there without someone connecting the dots!&quot;

&quot;Murals?&quot; Achoris placed his spindly fingers to his chest, for all the world looking quite flattered. &quot;Do they depict me well? Are they flattering?&quot;

As the focus shifted to the dog, she blinked, looking down at it again. &quot;Ah... yeah, they... they didn&#39;t have anything much smaller and... well.&quot; A bit of her nervous tension temporarily was replaced with a sort of soft fondness in her demeanor. &quot;He smiled at me, and none of the others did.

A beat, and the nervousness returned. &quot;But, um. I guess I didn&#39;t... accurately remember the size of this breed.

There are two bedrooms - The more lived-in one is mine, Achoris can stay in that one. The guest bedroom is next to it. Help yourself to anything. Food, drink, bath. I&#39;ll be back shortly.&quot;

Achoris passed over the reins with a slow smile and half-lidded eyes, nodding to the other man and turning to head right on inside to make himself at home. The interior was about twenty degrees cooler than outside, with a living area connected to a small kitchen and a hallway that led to the bedrooms and the bathroom. There wasn&#39;t much in the way of decoration other than some colorful rugs and curtains. A single bookshelf with a couple dozen fiction novels of various stories, a few knick knacks here and there, the odd article of clothing and some unwashed dishes painting the picture of a bachelor pad.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;... It&#39;s. For my best friend. The only friend I had in many cases. I tried to get him a puppy once about a decade ago, and he was, um.

&quot;But I believe the guild employs scouts around the world to report back on any findings that may develop into trails they can follow to a source of aether.

&quot;... There&#39;s... There&#39;s a horrible corruption in this city. I don&#39;t know if it can be fixed. If it can, I haven&#39;t the faintest idea where to start. This... This dog is a gift for my best friend. It was a gift I tried to give him a decade ago, when we lived here together. He was elated, but when he went out to buy supplies for the puppy, he never came back. I found out the Arbiters had framed him for murder. They just wanted him out of the temple of Anubis because he was a tiefling. They wanted him to... I don&#39;t know. Stop interacting with their Daughter of Divinity. They manufactured evidence against him, decided his guilt, unsubstantiated, and threw him into the coliseum to die. It took me intervening and... nearly killing the Arbiter to derail his death sentence. But it didn&#39;t clear his name. They still were decided on his guilt, and he was exiled. He didn&#39;t get to take his new puppy with him. They wouldn&#39;t let me go with him. He was just... thrown out.&quot;

She tensely fidgeted with her sleeve, not looking up from the dog despite not seeming to actually be seeing it. &quot;I managed to get out of here about a year ago. I found that friend again. And we&#39;ve... we&#39;ve managed to make a new life for ourselves. One that&#39;s happier. But I always wanted him to have a dog of his own. This... This feels like the last piece missing from that picture.&quot; She was quiet a moment, before giving a small shake of her head.

&quot;... You seem like a good person, Ilex. With a gentle soul. You don&#39;t belong here.&quot;

Ilex frowned as he listened to her story, leaning forward and shifting to cradle his chin in his mangled hand, his remaining fingers curled in. &quot;...I&#39;ve been getting that feeling. I just...&quot; He sighed. &quot;Mmn, I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve found anywhere I felt I belonged, and that may just be a permanent state of mind.

&quot;...

He then turned and made his way to the bathroom, knocking lightly and cracking the door open, before being beckoned inside.

They weren&#39;t even roommates. How gay.

Achoris had made some kind of comment about soaking for hours, particularly if he could get Ilex to join him. But it was unexpectedly... <em>quiet</em> in there, given the previous insinuation. Soft, murmured voices and a little bit of splashing every so often, but nothing that would point toward carnal activities. And then, not even thirty minutes later, the door opened once more, and Ilex emerged - fully clothed, hair dry, sleeves rolled up past his elbows... And carrying a sleeping Achoris in his arms, the spindly man bundled in a large towel with his head tucked into the crook of Ilex&#39;s neck.

He paused by where Skena was at - either in the guest bedroom or the living room - and whispered, &quot;Could you open the door for me? He fell asleep when I was washing his hair.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Probably a perk of buying such an expensive animal; it had been raised being treated like the quality product it was. 

She looked up, blinking a few times at the sight of Ilex and Achoris, before delicately getting to her feet, and wordlessly slipping past the men to open the indicated door, before flattening herself against the wall to allow Ilex to move past, giving the spectacle a gentle but very this-is-not-my-business smile.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I think so? There was one time when I was a child, my caretakers thought my dietary fixations to be unhealthy and tried to get me to eat healthier by their standards. I was always a fairly well mannered and quiet child, but that month I cried a lot, I remember feeling rather ill, and I’ve been told I was unusually naughty, sometimes going out of my way to steal candy. Which has always been horribly out of character for me. And… after I was exiled, but before I reunited with Kaleva, I was… in quite a state. I always attributed it to my fall, or to my emotional distress, but… I don’t know. It seems most likely I was starving. Sweets and pastries weren’t the easiest to afford when you had no coin to your name whatsoever. I managed to scavenge enough coin to properly feed myself once or twice, but it was meager and altogether miserable.&quot; She shrugged a little. &quot;I haven&#39;t been deprived like Achoris has, but I&#39;m sure it would be a similar affair. And… as I imagine is true for him as well, I certainly don’t <em>mind</em> other foods. But… they rapidly lose their appeal if there isn’t something sugary to supplement it. Ideally, just… a couple little bites of something sweet once a day is all it takes for me to feel sated. More is lovely, but I can do less only so much before I find myself inescapably occupied with cravings.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>
