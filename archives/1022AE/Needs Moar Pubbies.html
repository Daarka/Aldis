He&#39;d finished building and setting up everything he&#39;d need for the first two of the sled dogs he planned to get, and had saved up the money so he could buy both, and the puppies at the stables in Fielbarry were old enough to be adopted out. What was more, there were two separate litters, which meant he could get a puppy from each with the guarantee that they were genetically unrelated so he could eventually breed his own. And Atreyu, while still technically a puppy, was old enough and <s>questionably</s> mature enough that he could be trusted not to hurt the puppies accidentally, given his size.

Part of him also hoped that him having puppies around would warm Yiska and his pack toward them and maybe encourage eventually letting them near their own pups.

It was hard for him to keep his pace level with Skena&#39;s, and at the sounds of barking, his head and ears perked and his tail started wagging back and forth in long swishes.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The surest way to delight her was to put a happy Kaleva in front of her, and so his wholesome excitement was thoroughly contagious. She didn&#39;t seem to mind that she had to jog a little to keep up, her hand clasped snugly in his, with absolutely no complaints expressed about his eager pace. 

The kennel was a cozy but well kept establishment adjoining one of the town&#39;s stables. Several dog runs with half of their lengths sheltered by roofs lined the exterior of the building, with little doggy doors in each that allowed the animals to head inside for more dedicated shelter from the elements. It wasn&#39;t a place of luxurious accommodations--but it was closer to luxury than it was to squalor. A sort of office nook made up one of the places just inside the interior building in lieu of another kennel, and there, a massive male goliath was seated, his attention down in a book. As Kaleva and Skena approached, he looked up, recognition in his expression as his eyes landed on Kaleva, and he gave a simple nod of greeting, watching them continue forward expectantly; wordlessly waiting for them to state their business.

Kaleva had spent enough time in the kennels to be familiar with this man. Aukan was a bit over eight feet tall--large even by goliath standards, and with the muscled bulk to fully fill out that shape and result in an altogether deeply intimidating figure that towered over almost everyone. And yet... he had a demeanor not terribly unlike Kaleva&#39;s. He was a bit stony and aloof with people, a man of few words; but with the animals he cared for, the enormous tank of a man was uncannily gentle and tender.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He nodded a greeting back to Aukan. &quot;Morning. I&#39;m looking to adopt two of the husky pups from the litters you mentioned before - a male from one and a female from the other.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At his full height, Skena practically had to fold her neck back to meet his gaze, but apart from the moment taken to subtly widen her eyes at the man&#39;s stature, she politely moved on from her gawking. 

&quot;They are towards the back,&quot; he said simply, leading them down the barn-like aisle of the building--as several dogs bounded indoors from their runs to bounce around the gates closest to the new visitors eagerly. Though there was, weirdly, very little barking. As soon as one dog would start yapping in its excitement, Aukan addressed it with an almost hushed word of redirect, and the dog would fall back to quieter whimpers of enthusiasm. He had a powerful aura about him, and how much of it was due to his size was unclear--but the gentility with which he treated the dogs seemed, by no means, to be in place of garnering the beasts&#39; respect and obedience. And anyone familiar with the body language of canines would also be able to tell just from this short trip through the building that despite how sensitive the dogs were to reprimand, there was not an ounce of fear in their behavior towards Aukan. It was quite commendable on his part.

He came to a halt at the last two kennels in the row, pulling a keyring off his person and stooping to unlock the first one. These kennels had been slightly modified, with cozier beds and accommodations, and with the entrance to the outdoor run closed off. The reason was evident, as within both kennels was a female dog and some half-dozen puppies in various states of clumsy play or absolute unconsciousness. As Aukan unlocked the first kennel, the mother of that litter politely sat down despite her clear eagerness to say hi to the new folks, a sort of ritualistic element to her behavior that suggested she knew that she was to sit when the door was opened, and didn&#39;t even have to be directed to do so. 

&quot;They are weaned as off last week,&quot; Aukan rumbled. &quot;You may select one for yourself.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I&#39;ve got a nice place out in the woods where they&#39;ll have plenty of room to run, other dogs they can play with, and plenty of work to keep them engaged. I promise we&#39;ll treat them with all the love in the world. Does that sound okay to you?&quot;

For all he wanted to just dive in and fawn over all those fat, fluffy puppies, he wanted to put the mother at ease first. She may not have had Atreyu&#39;s intelligence to understand the words he was saying, but he hoped she&#39;d understand his intent.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The mother dog was a sweet thing who wiggled all over as Kaleva gave her attention, covering his hands in licks. It was hard to ascertain how much of Kaleva&#39;s words meant anything to her, if they did at all, but at the very least, she seemed exceptionally welcoming of him around her puppies, displaying no signs of wariness or protectiveness. And Kaleva would have an exponentially harder time giving her his undivided attention as the seconds ticked by, as the puppies that were awake began to swarm him and take turns attacking his shoes, his tail, his pants, and falling over themselves trying to stand on their hind legs to reach him.

Skena was more than happy to let Kaleva take the lead--but of course, she was enjoying herself plenty. How could anyone be anything less than enjoying themselves in a pit of squirmy fluffy warm little puppies? But as much as they were a <em>delight</em> to watch, her attention was on Kaleva more often than not. That was her favorite part of this, after all.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Yes, hello, good morning! No, I&#39;m sorry, that&#39;s attached, but you&#39;re welcome to try taking it,&quot; he added that last part to a puppy who had taken his tufted tail tip into her mouth and was presently trying to walk away with it, stretching his tail to its limits and walking in half-circles around him.

As much as he was enjoying himself, he was also taking note of each of the puppies&#39; different personalities. One of the pups curled right up in his lap and promptly tried to fall asleep, others were bound and determined to climb their way up to his ears. One stood on his thigh and had his paws on Kaleva&#39;s chest and was stretched up to gently nibble and lick his nose, tail wagging happily. Another was delightedly chewing on his boot.

Eventually, though, it became clear that Kaleva had found his choice. The little red and white male with bright blue eyes who had been nibbling at his nose was now tucked up in Kaleva&#39;s arms, licking at the underside of his chin and wagging his tail, and Kaleva looked up at Skena with that hopelessly in love look on his face.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ultimately, she settled in to give the mother belly rubs as she watched Kaleva be softly mauled, and as he gave her that hopeless look, her grin widened.

The next litter went much the same, though he had Skena hold on to his first acquisition so he could look over the rest with a slightly narrower range, having Aukan point out the females in the litter so he could focus on them specifically.

And he wound up falling in love again, this time with a mostly black female with white socks and a white patch on her chest in the shape of a bird with spread wings, as well as a white chin and bright blue eyes.

As they stepped out of the second kennel, Aukan shut and locked it behind them, leading them back towards the place he had originally been sat at. Without much preamble (that is: none at all), he wordlessly rummaged around for a moment, before producing a few sheets of paper, already filled with neat script. Setting them on the table, he pivoted them to face Kaleva, and set an ink pen beside it. 

&quot;This is a contract,&quot; he murmured, his voice even and gravelly, &quot;Binding you to never willingly bringing harm to these animals, and agreeing that--should you no longer wish to own them--you will return them here.&quot; His words, though a bit monotone, had a sort of authority to them that made it clear that there was no permissible wiggle room in these standards; he clearly took the wellbeing of his dogs very seriously. 

Skena smiled in gentle understanding, knowing none of that would be an issue, and reached out to offer to take the female from Kaleva to free his hands.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He signed both contracts in the required places, and passed over the necessary gold for both pups. &quot;Thanks, Aukan.

&quot;I look forward to hearing of it. They are in good hands.&quot; With that, he picked up his book again, seeming content with the exchange.

Skena was doing okay with holding both puppies, but it was clearly not the easiest thing in the world, as they very quickly decided that circumstances be damned, they were going to play with each other.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Finch is cute. Song and Finch. That&#39;s absolutely charming.&quot; Her gaze shifted back to Kaleva himself then, that warmth in her expression extending far beyond the simple being enamored with cute puppies. She knew how happy he was in this moment. Knew how much he&#39;d had to overcome to get to this point--to feel safe risking new ventures that would make him happy. To know he would be able to protect the things he had built for himself, that he could aspire for something new that was important to him and it wouldn&#39;t be taken from him in a cruel twist of fate that he couldn&#39;t protect it from. He wasn&#39;t powerless anymore. He was happy. Happy, and two puppies heavier.

&quot;We&#39;re going to have our work cut out for us,&quot; she continued amusedly. &quot;Raising Atreyu had challenges of its own, but he was always very clever--and that makes it easier to teach him. Normal puppies are a fair bit more chaotic than what you&#39;re used to. But the good news is that with two of them--plus Atreyu--they&#39;ll play with each other and entertain each other a fair amount.&quot; She held Song&#39;s chunky little paw, wiggling it towards Kaleva teasingly. 

&quot;Do you want to hold these two when we get inside, and I&#39;ll explain to Atreyu that he has to be calm and gentle while he introduces himself? He&#39;s usually pretty good about not plowing new friends over, but he also puts his mouth on Gummy enough for me to be a little cautious. These two are very Gummy sized.&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, May 2, 2022 1:56 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>
