After a brief pause to take a collective exhale, the party spurred into movement again; time could not be wasted in these critical moments, or else the bounty of valuable components in front of them would go to waste. Reflexively, Cassiana cast <em>Gentle Repose</em> on the newly-created corpse, greatly slowing the process of magical deterioration to buy them more wiggle room. 

Kaskra and Cairn, previously agreed upon by the party to helm the harvesting endeavor, fell into step with one another, as Cass and Clove bestowed quick boons upon each of them to aid in their tasks. Kaskra was confident in his familiarity with such specimens, and knowledgably guided Cairn through the process of carving open the broodmother, carefully extracting the pieces of its otherworldly anatomy that they found value in. As each component was cleanly carved free, Achoris, Niamh, and Clove assisted in stabilizing it for transport back to town under Kaskra&#39;s guidance, ensuring it would not lose its potency--and value--on the journey. Achoris, somehow, was able to summon a spectral chest, a container of two by three cubic feet in capacity--though (potentially) already housing a few items.

Working together in this manner, pieces were extracted--with Cairn managing to avoid cutting into anything hazardous in the process--carefully preserved through magical means, and then stowed away in Achoris&#39; chest, which he explained could be summoned again once they were back in town. Even the broodmother&#39;s essence, an ethereal and intangible pulse of aether through her body that threatened to weaken and dissipate in the absence of her life, was expertly captured, harnessed, and contained in a waiting aether crystal meant to house just such an energy. As that mote of magic, almost akin to electricity in nature, transferred into the crystal, its rosy hue bled out to be replaced with a dusky teal color, emitting a faint glow of the same appearance.

When the most valuable and time-sensitive components had been seen to, the party&#39;s attention shifted to the more mundane components, as the last remnants of aether that had woven through the broodmother dissipated back into the world. With the time constraint no longer looming over them, they were free to carve away at their leisure, no longer requiring the assistance of everyone simultaneously. 

By the time this was all concluded, it was noted they had about ten minutes left to make use of their ability to walk on water, or at least before it would have to be re-cast. But for the moment, they could move about the space without being submerged, exploring the broodmother&#39;s lair. After all... they still hadn&#39;t found an aether node.

&quot;I can&#39;t say that I&#39;m opposed to a refreshing swamp dip. But there&#39;s only one thing more I need to grab.&quot;

She took a small dagger from her belt and made her way to the creature with the largest mandible in the clearing. The blade proved to be wicked sharp as she made short work of extracting the entire left half of the pincher. While she lacked the carving grace of Cairn, Clove&#39;s efforts did not want for enthusiasm. 

Her task completed a few moments later, she swished the freed mandible in the murky water to clean it. Hefting her prize, she spun back to the group with delight in her eyes.

Something caught his attention, and he paused in his meandering stride to tilt his head, leaning forward and pushing his curtain of hair out of the way to peer beneath the surface of the water he walked upon. A small cavern beneath the water was visible to him, and something shiny glinted in it. He straightened up and called back to the group. &quot;Cairn.

The gleam of reflection had come from the facets of some aether crystals encrusted around the opening of an underwater cave, and the density of those crystals only increased the deeper in he looked. 

He would be able to swim all the way in, to find a pocket of air as the underwater cave opened up to a more standard cave, with the only point of entry seemingly being the watery passage. Inside, he found himself surrounded by a semi-familiar sight; while the immense density of aether crystals was new, the treasure was a bit more his speed.

Washed up on the water&#39;s edge were countless coins, gems, and various pieces made from precious metals. Amongst the hoard were tatters of clothing, long rotted by the water, and the occasional bone, wisp of hair, shoe, or other mundane belonging. It appeared that, while the broodmother had made sickening use of the organic matter she drew into her lair, these items were not so much of interest to her, and the currents had swept them out of the way.

She lazily kicked her way to the island where Kaskra was sketching. Climbing out of the water, she wrung her body in a vaguely canine manner, flinging small drops of water around her.

She continued to drip dry as Kaskra walked over, and ponderously read his note. 

&quot;Well, I was thinking some kind of magic to keep the sharp points and edges strong, but I&#39;d like to fashion it into a club of sorts. I&#39;d hate for the impressive stabby bits to break if I&#39;m hitting a bad person!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As one might expect, the overall condition of the poor the was hardly worth describing after the natural disaster of a group had gotten through with it. Fishbert, as he had dubbed it in his mind, and his blowgun were deposited by the group before he was off again to go and scavenge some materials from the nearby ruins.

Again he reappeared minutes later with a hodgepodge of wood fragments and slick-covered stones that he started to carefully stack in front of the mutilated body of the aboleth broodmother. If he was capable of such, he&#39;d like have felt a pang of sadness at the state of the creature. Instead he was left with some measure of regret, the final words of the creature still stuck in his head.

Still, he seemed fairly content to make his little shrine, leaving the gooped up coin on top as he sat down in front of it and closed his eyes, hands clasped firmly together.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The feeling wasn&#39;t necessarily uncommon for her, and she let a small sigh out before releasing the emotions she couldn&#39;t characterize. 

&quot;No, if you all explored and think it&#39;s good, I don&#39;t need to see it. Goodness knows I&#39;m not the most investigative.&quot;

She gave a small smile, turning to Cairn.

&quot;I want a club! I keep breaking wooden ones but this mandible seems made to cromch. I bet it will last a long time!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Seemingly satisfied with the effort, her attention drifted to where Clove stood beside Cairn and Achoris as she watched the goblin&#39;s expression change as her face disappeared underneath the mushroom hat. Twisting the water from her hair, sharp amber eyes drifted up into Achoris&#39; face and narrowed curiously as she watched the interaction for a moment. As Clove seemed to relax, the stare wavered and turned into a sidelong glance as the rogue settled back into her heels, resting her elbows on her knees as she addressed the elf beside her.
&quot;That was some pretty impressive spell slinging Cass - not surprising of course, but I can definitely see why the guild keeps you close on hand to escort these missions. Thank you, by the way. Whatever those tiny buggers were trying to do, it was exceptionally unpleasant.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
