This time of day especially, it was practically commonplace for new faces to wander in, and this night was no exception. 

The humanoid--<em>perhaps</em> a woman, but an androgynous one if so--who came through the doors was nothing short of striking in appearance, practically alien. Dark skin the color of deep ocean water, accentuated by the massive scorpion-like tail trailing elegantly behind them in a delicate upward curl that held it aloft off the ground, with digitigrade legs sporting strange, rather insectoid feet--that all was enough to make the individual sufficiently noteworthy. Their hair was shaved short on the sides, russet-wine in color, with the unshaved top of the head pulled into a short ponytail in the back. Frills of aquatic fins made up the ears and looked like fringe on the sides of their neck, but that paled in comparison to the unsettling composition of their face. Nothing was remotely humanoid from the cheekbones down, instead displaying a set of what looked like mandibles framing a distinctly lipless, inhuman mouth. Above that was a relatively flat nose, and what should have been eyes were instead gouged out empty sockets. And finally, in the center of the forehead sat one intact eye in their stead, an eerie yellow in color with only a small black pupil at its center.

And that eye seemed perfectly functional, despite its vacant counterparts, idly looking around as the creature unhurriedly wandered towards the bar, those alien feet clicking their talons softly against the hardwood with each step.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A yuan-ti malison, wearing a mask of gold and a black sash around his middle, golden coins strung and shimmering as they chimed together musically from the snap and coil of his waist. Cornrows like snakes hung down to his lower back, gleaming with flashes of gems and gold wire. The glow of the gems cast an unearthly pallor over his dark skin, and made the rainbow iridescence of his scaly lower body take on a splash of blues and purple hues. His serpentine lower body coiled and rolled along with his upper body, arms moving in sinuous and graceful gestures.

The hybrid&#39;s one eye trained onto the yuan-ti, a faint tilt to her head in intrigue. From behind the bar, a pleasant tiefling spoke up to ask if the stranger wanted something to eat or drink, and it took a second for them to pull their attention off the stage and towards the smiling woman. But they only gave a shake of their head, wordlessly moving forward instead to head deeper into the room, towards the stage. 

It was dim enough, with the performance enrapturing enough, that normally they would have a decent chance of going relatively unnoticed by those who would otherwise gawk at their appearance. But any hope of subtlety faded as they drew closer to the stage, and the lights illuminating the yuan-ti for his performance cast enough of a glow onto the stranger that it inexplicably fluoresced their entire complexion, making their body practically glow an eerie teal-green. This, understandably, drew some onlookers attention their way, some with faint hints of concern, but that one off-yellow eye was trained exclusively on the stage as they came to a halt a normal distance away for spectating.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And while his form spun in circles that had his coiled tail rolling and his dreadlocks whipping out around him, his head kept snapping around to focus in on the hybrid, holding the gaze until the rest of his body forced him to snap his head around once more.

He recognized them. He knew who they belonged to. And though they had been instrumental in giving him the opportunity to escape, he did not know their purpose here.

Without a single verbal or somantic component, he used his metamagic to subtly cast a spell, and when the music ended, he just - disappeared from sight, made invisible. The audience gasped in surprise, then cheered, thinking it part of the performance.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

… But she could understand it. She stood there for a moment, contemplating the best way to appear unthreatening. Ultimately, she simply turned and ambled back towards the bar, her movements lazily slow. 

She said nothing, yet Valentine suddenly looked her way with raised eyebrows. A pause, and then the tiefling smiled again. “… That’s… steak you want?” She asked hesitantly. The single nod the hybrid offered was lost to the blind barkeep, and yet, Valentine seemed to understand the acknowledgement all the same.

“Certainly. Have a seat, dear; we’ll have that right out for you.”

Petra glanced down at one of the nearest barstools, pausing a moment, before helping herself onto it. Her tail draped almost limply down the back of the stool, the barb hanging just over the floor, looking perfectly relaxed. At least, as relaxed as a venomous appendage could.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He could not exactly move closer, not without risking running into someone, and with his size that was a very distinct possibility.

He took some time to consider options and avenues of escape if they became needed, but ultimately knew that the Inn was likely his safest place to stay.

Thus composed and as prepared as he could be, he made his way back out, slithering his way over to the bar to take up a position a few feet from the hybrid, looking her over and noting the changes that had been made to her appearance since he&#39;d last seen her. &quot;Petra.

Except by this time, her food had been served, and she was chewing on it in the worst way possible; those nestled mandibles flexing back and forth to rhythmically mince apart the steak held in front of her mouth, pulling it past her inner teeth in the process. She gradually ceased this unsettling display as her focus shifted to the yuan-ti, setting the remaining steak down. 

Even as she continued to chew, a presence entered Mahva’s mind. Similar in nature to Valentine’s telepathy, though perhaps closer in actuality to Nikotiemus’. Yet even more abstract. Not words, not quite images… but the most raw of concepts and emotions.

A memory of concern. The familiarity of Ruhak. The sinking dread of being seen when you wanted to stay hidden, of being caught in a lie your life depended on keeping. Bindings, physical restrictions. Pain. Body parts cracking under pressure. Being watched. A nauseating sensation of having one’s eyes ripped out of their sockets. The frigid cold of salty water enshrouding one completely. The taste of brine, the scent of it forced into a nose that filled with sea water. The pressure of water over one’s body, growing more and more crushing as lungs burned with the strain of a breath held longer than was healthy. An involuntary convulsion, and water filling the lungs. Spasms, the body’s hellbent attempts to stay alive despite there being no hope for such an outcome. Then cold, wet, salty darkness, clouding over the mind and quickly consuming the consciousness. 

Darkness, but dry warmth. Air. Convulsions as lethal amounts of saltwater were heaved from the lungs, the stomach, dripped from empty eye sockets. Draining from gills that had never existed before. Sand underfoot. The passing of time. Regaining the ability to see. The recognition of the environment being Kaldaross on the mainland, not the islands of Dhargari she had once shared with Mahva. A desire to distance herself from that which had killed her; movement north. Away from the coast, reluctantly. 

The notion of Fielbarry as a colorful place. An intrigue. A familiar yuan-ti. Unlikely serendipity.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Though no proper <em>words</em> entered Mahva’s mind, there was the distinct observation that Petra’d had more to her name as a slave than she currently did. Which wasn’t terribly hard to believe, seeing as an unspeaking scorpion person with gouged our eyes probably didn’t do well in job interviews. 

A pause, as she contemplated something. Then a sense of wry emotion, acknowledgement towards her empty eye sockets and strange mouth. The latter would likely take Mahva a moment to make sense of; her anatomy was bizarre enough that he couldn’t be blamed for not understanding what she was indicating. But as she returned to gnawing at her steak, those mandibles practically chewing her meal before it even entered her mouth, the odd sensation she was conveying suddenly made sense.

Her tongue had been taken, too. 

So yes, <em>technically</em>, she was in need of those pieces. But the almost whimsical air behind those thoughts made them seem less than serious.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, September 30, 2022 11:30 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He did owe her a debt. Not one she felt like holding over his head—but objectively, a debt existed. She had no moral holdups about accepting his help in exchange. 

There was a warmth in his mind, a note of appreciation and acceptance. A contemplative pause.

Recognition that all she had ever been used to doing did not translate well to a civilized job. She tipped her head thoughtfully at him, and wondered in his mind at what kind of help <em>he</em> could make use of. It was not explicitly conveyed, but… the <em>flavor</em> of the idea seemed to imply less the kind of favors commonly done between people, and more the nature of service she was used to.

Folding his arms on the counter, he turned his attention to the barkeep. &quot;Valentine, are you aware of any places in town that are in need of an extra pair of hands or two?

Her brows lifted as she hummed aloud. “The pincers sound intriguing.” She sighed wistfully. “Every once in a while, it truly is unfortunate to be blind. But I digress; how are you with physical strength and brute force, dear?” Val posed to the hybrid.

There was a stretch of silence, wherein Petra presumably responded as she had been thus far, in the privacy of the recipient’s mind. Then Val nodded.

“Then I wouldn’t mind hiring you to keep an eye on the bar. I’ve been doing all the bouncing myself thus far, and we don’t encounter many disturbances, but delegating that task to someone capable would allow me to focus that much more on my work. And would also extend that service to times I may not be manning the bar. Would that be agreeable?”

Another silence—though Petra’s demeanor looked notably lightened, mandibles back to mincing away at the meat as she communicated. 

“Excellent. I’ll arrange a room for you, and let you settle in tonight. I can walk you through what you’ll need to know in the morning.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The evening of Samhain carried several odd occurrences with it. It was hard to get a read on Petra at the best of times, so ascertaining what she took away from the series of different and only tangentially related events was near impossible. But the following morning, when she was not scheduled to be on-duty in the tavern, she slowly meandered her way up to the second story of the inn, browsing the unmarked doors until she seemed to find the one she was after. Coming to a halt, she gave a single, soft knock.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her eye lifted its gaze to Mahva as he answered the door, posture straightening a tiny fraction. That presence entered his mind again; a pleasant greeting. A touch of uncertainty.

A sense that Ruhak wanted her destroyed, but... perhaps wanted to get something out of it, as well. Petra had not been alone, but who she had been grouped with was unclear. Slaves changing hands from one master to another. No... not another master. To a butcher. The distinct feeling of a ship rocking on ocean waves underfoot. When the blindfolds came off, there was no sense of Ruhak being seen. Many strangers, all at home on the ship. One with brambles in his hair, who took gleeful sport in prying open her mouth to carve out her tongue until she practically choked in her own blood. Her head being restrained. More hands were required. But it was the visage of the man with brambles in his hair leaning over her, driving sharp agony into the sockets of her eyes, that was the last vision she had before the blackness took over. Before the water took over. 

A silence. And then other memories. Fresher memories. As fresh as just the night prior. When the man with brambles in his hair locked eyes with Petra in the tavern below. The horror in his eyes. The way he made himself scarce, ignored her attempts at communication. And that lingering curiosity that had brought her to Mahva&#39;s door... wondering what to think of him. Such a stark contrast between the sadistic, malicious glee that sent her to a watery grave, and the horrified man who had grown pale and fled her presence. Everything was tangled in uncertainty.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;That is... interesting. Admittedly, I&#39;m not sure what to make of it. I&#39;ve certainly known a great many people whose pasts are entirely different from their presents, myself included, and the reasons for those changes are varied. But as long as you work here, you are under the protection of the staff.

She shrugged a little, raising the tea to her mouth to begin what was clearly a tedious and graceless process of using her mandibles to try to drip the liquid into her mouth, then lifting her chin to let gravity drain it back down her throat. No tongue to lap with, and no lips to create suction. 

Her response didn&#39;t seem <em>terribly</em> worried about her own safety, indicating again at how adamant the man had seemed to get away from her. But acknowledging that too much of that could drive someone to rid themselves of the source of their stress. Her concern, it seemed, was more focused on knowing if the man <em>was</em> entirely different from his past or not. If he had brought those insidious connections north with him, or if he was running from them just as much as Petra and Mahva were.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It&#39;s possible that he might take action to avoid any potential consequences of his actions, whether that be running away, avoiding the location, or trying to silence you, but... The last seems unlikely, from my experiences with him. Or if he tries, he would not be likely to succeed.

The presence in Mahva&#39;s mind was a warm one, pleasant at the thought of the two large men. A feeling of purpose. Of a job well done. Of filling a role, like the satisfaction of a puzzle piece slotting into a vacant place in a puzzle. A feeling she had been missing since reawakening--but this time, it was a feeling she was able to fulfill around people who seemed... quite pleasing to her. Fun. The concept of fun seemed to gradually materialize. What she had before, in Dhargari, was satisfying and structured, but dangerous and surrounded by individuals who either did not spare her any thought, or outright sought to harm her. This... was the same satisfaction, but under infinitely more pleasant and happy circumstances. And the notion of Mahva himself was interwoven in those emotions; pleased that, of all the snakes from her past, he was the one to resurface in her new life. He certainly was no Ruhak.

It was strange. Whereas Mahva bore the visage of a man, with the silvered tongue of one as well, it was a surface-level degree of emotion and social grace. Beneath it, his emotions internally were quiet and simple. Uncomplicated and sparse. But Petra seemed the opposite; especially with the removal of her tongue and eyes, she seemed to struggle greatly to express herself through body language, and her face was partially <em>incapable</em> of emoting in many cases. Yet buried beneath that unmoving chitin, hidden behind her communication barriers... she was full of life. And for someone who had been mutilated and murdered on the heels of treason, she seemed, against all odds, to be a creature of quiet but bright positivity and lightness. The emotions that had surrounded what she conveyed of her death and of Yarrow seemed like afterthoughts in comparison to the heartfelt implications behind the happiness she expressed at just getting to do a friendly spar to prove she was worthy of the job she had acquired.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
