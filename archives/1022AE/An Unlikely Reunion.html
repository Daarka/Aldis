A boring journey was a safe journey, and even though the temperate forests of Aedrenor had long welcomed him, it was hard to shake his cautious nature aside even as he trudged along the side of a lesser-used road to Fielbarry.

He wore a long off-white duster that did little to hide his large frame. Standing over 6 feet tall and broad in the chest, he had little to worry about by way of highway bandits usually. Between the warhammer strapped to his side and the heavy-set scowl marring his brown face, he could take care of himself.

How long had he been walking again? He groaned, feeling the ache in his feet and the bite of his heavy-laden backpack straps dig into his armpits... The sun had rose high above the trees, and after a few more yards he had to admit that a small lunch break was worth the time.

Ahead, a small clearing to the side of the road  surrounded by trees looked useful for small caravans to post up for the night. A quick glance at a distance suggested it seemed empty enough, urging him forward.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But nearing the end, the sound of boots crunching through twigs and foliage were made audible to his ears, and just beyond the line of the trees, a humanoid figure walked through the woods.

The man - the tiefling, as it turned out - paused briefly in his stride, turning his head to look over at Cha Cha, and went very still.

It had been over thirty years since Cha Cha had seen this particular tiefling, with his pale blue skin and coppery brown hair. White eyes with a subtle glow seemed all the more bright with the stained streaks of face paint surrounding his eyes and trailing down his cheeks and neck. He wore chainmail over leather and furs, a familar shield on his back and a battle axe at his side. His tail had a set of three spines on the end, barely held off the ground. And the evidence of <em>why</em> Cha Cha hadn&#39;t seen Nils in thirty years lay in the evidence of a scar across his jugular at the side of his neck.

Because the last Cha Cha would have seen him, it was at the burial site where he laid to rest his wife, the elf Eidunn, and took his own life at her side.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A hand had moved to the hilt of his hammer, not quite pulling it free but holding it, just in case.

His eyes roamed the all-too familiar tiefling, he himself much larger (and admittedly, hairier) than he was thirty years ago, but he knew he&#39;d been recognized.

After a moment of shock, the warhammer came loose as Cha Cha stumbled to his feet with a snarl. He pointed it at Nils, though he dared not move closer to who he saw as the walking dead. &quot;What kinda sick joke is this? Who sent ya?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His voice barely had any inflection to it, his words seeming to sigh past his lips. He looked away, as if he&#39;d suddenly catch a glimpse of her nearby... Or maybe it was hard to face his old friend in the rebellion, aged so far beyond what he remembered.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The tip of his warhammer tilted down further, touching the ground. He made no motion to close the gap, but he was tired, and he wanted to believe him. &quot;Someone took her?&quot; He asked almost numbly, brow furrowing deeper in confusion. &quot;I haven&#39;t seen her since... since we buried her.

Alone, unlike the brave perpetual companion of the other Flamekeepers.

&quot;I&#39;m headed to Fielbarry, checking it out. Should be far south enough that no one home should be looking for anyone there, plus the local adventurer&#39;s guild is hiring.

It helped he didn&#39;t <em>smell</em> like an undead, though Cha Cha resisted the urge to give him a better sniff, just to be sure.

&quot;Ya certainly <em>smell</em> like you&#39;ve been out in the woods for a while.&quot; he mumbled, adjusting the map so Nils could see it too.

He hefted his warhammer, sliding it back into its rightful place in preparation for another long walk.

Though he was used to traveling alone out of necessity, it was nice to hear another friendly pair of boots on the ground nearby. It helped they were headed to a town, too. If all went well, they might even get to sleep in a proper bed for once.

The question was one he had quietly dreaded, though expected to hear eventually. His lips thinned a moment, a glance cast over his shoulder before he adjusted his grip on his backpack.

&quot;We failed pretty bad. The brass got some inside tips on us and whipped our asses &#39;til we were either dead, captured, or gone. I don&#39;t exactly know how it shook out in Kropar, but out where I was they blew a hole in the side of my house just as we were starting to think we had the drop on them.&quot;

An uncomfortable quiet radiated from Cha Cha, and when he spoke up again, he couldn&#39;t hide the remorse and shame in his voice. &quot;I ran away. Took a few members with me, barged into Mina&#39;s place and hid there until we could hoof it south.&quot;

Ah, Mina.. It perhaps was a familiar name to Nils; Wilhelmina had never joined the Flamekeepers, though she&#39;d helped a few folks out now and then out of &quot;common decency.&quot; Cha Cha had never been able to convince his cousin to take up the cause, though he&#39;d tried a few times in their younger years.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Abandoned their cause and the people who needed his help when he couldn&#39;t deal with the heartbreak and guilt of losing his wife.

&quot;I stopped by Marko&#39;s homestead,&quot; Nils spoke after a few moments. Like Mina, Marko was not a member of the Flamekeepers, but had been known to offer aid to its members if they needed a safe haven. He&#39;d been a portly older tiefling, red skinned, with yellow eyes and white hair and beard, and only half a tail.

&quot;It was burned down. The skeletons of he and his dogs were scattered around. His horns had been removed.&quot;

He fell quiet for a short span, and then said quietly, &quot;At least you&#39;re alive.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He could pretend it was a good thing, as the words had meant to be. &quot;Somehow, still alive. And you, still walking.

Theeere was that sense of humor he was known for. It was a bit rusty, and lacked his usual mischievous grin, but there was a flicker of sly cheek in the set of his eyes.

He went quiet, then gestured helplessly with a hand. &quot;I&#39;d lost enough already. And I didn&#39;t want them to see me like this if they were alive.&quot;

Anything could have happened in thirty years, and he didn&#39;t like dwelling on what-ifs.

He sized up the trees nearby as he shrugged off his heavy pack. It whumped to the ground with a this, and was soon joined by his Warhammer. Every little bit counted, he reasoned in agreement with Nils.

&quot;Gimme a minute. This one looks promising.&quot; He said, finally picking a sturdier tree to climb. He hopped up, grabbing a lower branch before yanking himself up off the ground into the treeline above. Carefully he picked his way up until the leaves thinned enough and he could trust no further branches, squinting out towards the south.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Emboldened by the visual, Cha Cha committed the direction to memory and began his descent to the ground. Once he was decently close he dropped the rest of the way, letting out a heavy thump. He paused to take a breath, then started gathering his things once more.

The tiefling wasn&#39;t exactly dumb, but opportunities for education hadn&#39;t exactly been available when he was growing up.

As they reached the outskirts of town, Nils grew noticably more quiet and wary, the set of his shoulders stiff and his pale eyes flicking around. But it didn&#39;t take long before he found himself relaxing by slow degrees, either, pulled out of his wariness by the sheer variety of people walking around.

Over there, a satyr was standing on a ladder while he hung up some garland of random odd baubles outside a store window, and he lifted a hand and called out a cheerful greeting to them. And not far down the street, a changeling, an obvious and unmasked changeling dressed in fine clothes tossed several coins into the offered hat of a street performer. There were genasi, tabaxi, even the occasional orc or goblin or kobold or dragonborn, and... And there were tieflings, too. Walking around without fear, without prejudice being thrown their way.

Nils slowly reached up to pull off his hood so he could better see everything, his mouth hanging open slightly.

&quot;...Is this place for real?&quot; he croaked at his companion.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But then, he hadn&#39;t exactly been expecting <em>this</em> many types of people walking around freely in one town. He slowed as they entered, his suspicious frown softening into a sense of relief and a twinge of dumbfounded. He kept expecting something to happen, something to ruin the pleasant airs of the town, but nothing came.

Nils voiced the question he&#39;d been wondering, glancing over to him. &quot;They said this place was full of strange folk, but this is... More than I expected.&quot;

He looked back, watching tieflings and aasimar, dwarves and elves, everything and everyone going about their lives without a care in the world. A small sound rumbled in the back of his throat before he cleared it. His hand pulled free from his Warhammer, moving to rub his neck while he gestured with his other thumb further in. &quot;...

His voice trailed off, staring once again in disbelief at what was walking down the street in the opposite direction. Nils had seen a lot of large dogs in his life, but nothing compared to the Cautican Hound the size of a large horse, completely tacked out like any riding animal and carrying a tiefling on its back.

Kaleva slowed his mount as he saw the bewildered looks on the faces of the two unfamiliar men, the larger of whom was familiar to him in ways he couldn&#39;t pin down.

When he looked up, Nils was looking down the street. Quickly he realized just what new thing had attracted his attention, his own just as quickly taken in. He let out a murmur under his breath about the size of the dog, wondering just where the hell they bred them that big. Seeing a tiefling saddled on top of it as casually as anyone riding a horse was just the cherry on top of the day&#39;s quickly deviating expectations.

He squinted up at him for a moment, expression guarding itself a little as he too recognized him in a way he couldn&#39;t place. He hadn&#39;t wanted to seem so new and out of place here, but he&#39;d picked up on it anyways and offered a polite turn. For that, he was grateful.

Cha Cha cleared his throat, one hand gesturing vaguely towards the town. &quot;Er, yes. Which way is the Adventurer&#39;s guild here? Was hoping to sign on here.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Any further questions he had at the moment were put on pause as Kaleva&#39;s origin was placed. He nodded slightly in understanding, having half a mind to ask him how the town had treated him; there wasn&#39;t much of a need though, considering how at ease he was striding down the streets in the saddle of a massive hound. Well enough treatment, he could reason.

The arrival of the tiny aasimar was a surprise, his head switching from looking up to looking quite far down to see her. At first he thought her a child, but her features and proportions weren&#39;t right for it. Just small then. Small, and not a small amount of visually unsettling. Briefly, he wondered if Nils was far from the only undead to walk the streets here, and felt his stomach churn a little at the thought.

Clearing his throat he pried his eyes away to look at Kaleva once again, dipping his head in gratitude. &quot;Thanks for the directions, stranger.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It&#39;s... nothing short of a tragedy that the people in Holbrook are as inhospitable as they are towards some races.&quot;

Skena glanced to Cha Cha with a curious look at his question. &quot;Vultures? I mean... yes, there are vultures just about everywhere I&#39;ve been, and Fielbarry is no exception. I, ah. I tend to collect dead things, so I do see some on occasion around our home, drawn to the smell. Sometimes I leave some of the meat out for them if it&#39;s not suitable for us to smoke and dry ourselves.&quot; She gave a little shrug. &quot;Can I ask what you&#39;re after a vulture for? That&#39;s not a pursuit you usually hear of.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She half-pivoted to gesture down the street. &quot;If you keep going as you are, the Creeping Root Inn is up ahead. Can&#39;t miss it.

Even his strange face paint situation drew very little attention. There didn&#39;t seem to be a huge need for him to do anything to alter its appearance--at least not for the sake of blending in. 

The inn was no exception; after passing through the doors, Nils found the interior cozy and lively, decidedly welcoming in its atmosphere. It was mid afternoon, which wasn&#39;t the busiest time for most taverns, but there were still a good number of patrons spread about, seated at the bar, seated at tables, occasionally going up or down the large staircase that led to a second story. There was no collective draw of attention towards Nils as he entered, no judgmental glowers from someone in a corner. Why would there be? He was just another person. Coming into an inn&#39;s tavern. The epitome of normalcy. 

This good atmosphere probably had a lot to do with the barkeep, who seemed to radiate an aura of it around her. Indeed a tiefling, and a gorgeous one at that, with a thick mane of hair in a gradient of sunrise colors, and soft lavender complexion. Her eyes were not white like Nils&#39;, but similarly lacked a pupil--and were pale, not too far off from his coloration, but with a touch of a buttery yellow hue. And their paleness seemed less like a color and more like... a cloudy film.

Especially with Skena&#39;s description of her, Nils would be able to easily tell she was blind from the way her gaze never really fixed on the thing that had her attention. And yet, she moved about her space fluidly and without any apparent difficulties, seeming to know where everything was, and exactly what a full glass felt like versus one that needed more poured into it. 

As he stepped inside, she finished up passing a drink off to a patron, going to rinse off her hands and wipe them off with a fluffy rag, her face tilted towards the stranger with a warm, inviting smile, a little twitch of her elfin ear nearest to Nils indicating she was waiting to hear more of his steps and his voice before she could recognize him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Ah, don&#39;t worry about the coin,&quot; she replied dismissively. &quot;First one&#39;s on the house. That&#39;s how I get ya,&quot; she added with a coy grin. &quot;Thank you for that description; give me one moment to reach out to my brothers. What can I get you in the meantime?&quot;

Nils blinked back at Val, taking the mead in hand with a soft thank you. Her tone and her statement had him straightening up though, a new energy jolting through his otherwise lethargic demeanor.

Nils was shaking now, and he wracked his mind desperately, trying to think of any sort of explanation that would be plausible but also not oust both himself and Eidunn as undead. &quot;I-I do understand your position, yes.

She hummed softly, giving a little nod and straightening up again. &quot;I don&#39;t think chaperones are necessary. And I have no reason to believe you have ill intent. All the same, let the record state that I am quite resourceful, and I <em>will</em> seek you out should I find something horrible has come of this,&quot; she threatened with that same sunshiney warmth. Though it did seem the threat was for the purpose of a simple disclaimer to ease her own conscious, and not something she passionately stood behind at the moment.

&quot;There is no <em>Eidunn</em> in town that I, nor my brothers, have met. There is, however, a woman who matches the description you gave, apart from the name. She goes by Cassiana Hale, and she does work for one of my brothers. She is also not currently in town; she is employed with the Valehunter&#39;s guild, and they are off on a mission currently. They should be back any day now, though such things are not scheduled definitively, as they are out on those missions until they get what they&#39;re after.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Val was able to seamlessly hold two conversations at once, much to the disquiet of anyone who caught on to that fact. She beamed at Cha Cha at his question. &quot;We have more than a little bit of everything here. I can certainly get you situated. We&#39;ll get a meal out for you in just a moment, too.&quot;

She turned to go see to his drink, and just as before, a few moments later, the half-orc reappeared with another plate of the same of what had been given to Nils. A <em>very</em> nice meal for two men who had been roughing it for a very long time, joined shortly thereafter by a glass of decent-quality vodka, slid across the bartop in Cha Cha&#39;s direction.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His lips pressed tight, and he sat his happy little ass down at the bar. &quot;I want whiskey.&quot;

&quot;Certainly,&quot; she replied, drifting towards where he was to lean in to him a little. &quot;Right after you apologize to these good patrons for creating such a rancid impression of my establishment.&quot;

Arseni&#39;s lip curled, but... he wasn&#39;t so quick to call <em>her</em> a fatass, something hesitant and clearly intimidated beneath his bristly display.

As she smiled warmly at him, she reached a hand behind her, and with a small scraping sound of unknown-material against the hardwood floor, the gnarled orange staff that had been resting against the far wall pulled itself into her hand as if magnetically. It&#39;s shifting eye settled on Arseni, at the same time as Val&#39;s own eyes began to blot out to inky black--

&quot;Don&#39;t be a fuCKING BIT<em>CH, VAL!</em>&quot; Arseni practically yelped, the words and tone aggressive, but his inflection betraying a spike of adrenaline. &quot;<em>FINE</em> give them their FUCKING BOTTLE--!&quot;

Just as quickly as it had begun to creep in, that sickly darkness bled out of Valentine&#39;s appearance, replaced once more with her usual sunshine. She had never stopped smiling, and she casually stood up straight again, humming softly to herself as she went to go retrieve an unopened bottle of the honey mead.
