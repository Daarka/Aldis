Don&#39;t really need one, I&#39;m great at climbing and jumping into places I shouldn&#39;t be. This way!&quot; 

Beckoning her to follow, the energetic satyr skipped his way through the aisles and over to part of the shop that seemed to have been set aside specifically for horrific taxidermy experiments. There were raccoon slippers that looked like they&#39;d be a tripping hazard. A squirrel with a necklace, sprawled out on display in a boudoir pose. Another squirrel holding onto a tree branch with one hand and holding some nuts with his other hand. His own nuts. There were a pair of fawns that looked like they&#39;d been just sewn together around the middle, the bottom halves of both gone, dressed up with frilly collars and cute hats with a pale pink ribboned wall mount. An absolutely horrifyingly done fox arranged to sit in a chair like a person. Several rats that had been sewn together to create a twelve-legged ratipede. Another rat with eight tails sprouting out of its face like a lovecraftian nightmare. A mounted bobcat head giving a saucy grin and side eye.

It was, honestly, a lot to take in and deal with. And for some reason Ingrid had banished all these magnificent works of art to the furthest corner.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Turning back to Arsast, she gave him an affirmative nod.
&quot;This one is perfect.

Just the double fawns and the saucy bobcat. But I&#39;ll let you know as soon as I get more in!&quot;

After ringing her up for the purchase, he motioned her to follow as he went to head upstairs. &quot;Skena and Kaleva&#39;s place is right up this way. They have a magic door that kind of serves as a portal from here to their place. They live way out of town, so this just makes it easier for them to come and go.&quot;

He led Niamh up through his and Ingrid&#39;s living quarters - quite a bit cleaner from the looks of things, probably at Ingrid&#39;s insistence - and knocked on an otherwise completely normal-looking door. &quot;Hellooooo!&quot;

It took a minute, but the door eventually opened to reveal Kaleva on the other side, blinking at Arsast and Niamh. &quot;Oh, hi.

&quot;Arsast found me this for my room with the guild!&quot;
Lowering it gingerly back under her arm as if it were a delicate treasure, she fixed the tiefling with a warm smile.
&quot;Thank you for that, by the way. I just wanted to swing by and check in - I had a couple questions for Skena, if she&#39;s home. And snacks!&quot;

Kaleva cast a tired look after the satyr, then gave Niamh a small smile. &quot;Sure. She&#39;s tending to her beehives at the moment, but it shouldn&#39;t take her long. Come on in.&quot;

The charcoal-colored tiefling stepped aside to let her into what was quite suddenly a cottage out in the middle of the woods. The sounds and smells of the city were gone, replaced with the smell of earth and pine and the sounds of bird song. It was a warm, cozy cottage that had the air of still being newly-built. In front of the fireplace in the living room lay Kaleva&#39;s massive horse-sized Cautican hound, who looked up at Niamh, perking his floppy ears and tilting his head to the side. &quot;It&#39;s okay, Atreyu, she&#39;s a friend,&quot; Kaleva said to the dog, who started thumping his tail on the ground.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, July 9, 2022 7:26 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He walked over to rub behind one of Atreyu&#39;s silky orange ears, and the hound thudded his head into Kaleva&#39;s chest, letting out a groan of appreciation. &quot;We have two husky puppies as well, they&#39;re only a couple months old.

Atreyu got up to follow them, walking alongside Niamh and sniffing at her hair, his tail wagging. She thought he was a smart, handsome stud! She was his new best friend.

The beehives were located in a small field of wildflowers, where two fat puppies were gamboling about, both of them with the same stick in their mouths. One was liver and white, the other predominantly black with white markings, both with bright blue eyes.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It took her a minute to even notice she had visitors, having been closely scrutinizing the thick mass of bees collected on the screen she was holding. When she did catch sight of Niamh and Kaleva, she gave a little start, flushing slightly, before delicately replacing the frame in the hive box, putting the lid back over it and making her way over to them. 

&quot;Hi Niamh... is everything alright?&quot; She asked, glancing between the two with a bit of awkwardness.

When she returned, she was holding a thoroughly bizarre looking creature. It was about the size of a housecat, but completely hairless, with a longer, thicker tail than a cat, and a face more like that of a large-eyed snake, framed in wide, goblinoid ears. It had stumpy, wrinkly little legs, complete with a thumb-like digit on the forepaws, and between those grubby hands and its mouth, it was fiercely clinging on to the missing fox. 

Said fox was easily larger than this creature. And yet, the creature&#39;s jaw was unhinged like the snake it vaguely resembled, and it had half of one of the fox&#39;s legs down its gullet. 

With a bit of a long-suffering look, Skena grabbed the creature by its scruff and worked on slowly prying him away from the taxidermy piece. This resulted in a lot of unattractive sounds from the little animal, with rattling garbles and growls and hisses that sounded as if they came from a cat who had been smoking for sixty years and was just punched in the throat.</span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/995483106742108190/996265903949889568/GUMMY2.png?ex=655c2c6d&amp;is=6549b76d&amp;hm=aebebf50f56be0ae3c29512ec253febe3fa6e2c2def3364ef276c86f3b15c72b&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/995483106742108190/996265903949889568/GUMMY2.png?ex=655c2c6d&amp;is=6549b76d&amp;hm=aebebf50f56be0ae3c29512ec253febe3fa6e2c2def3364ef276c86f3b15c72b&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: GUMMY2.png (1.09 MB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

He pushed lightly on his heel to rock slightly on the legs of the chair, his tufted tail absently flicking around. He paused, though, as the puppies in the living room decided it was time to serenade everyone. Song started, of course, throwing back her head and waah-waah-ing her little heart out, while Finch followed with an oddly delicate coo.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, are you not getting paid enough attention?&quot; Kaleva called out to them.

The singing intensified. Kaleva let out a snort and righted himself on the chair to go head out of the kitchen (they weren&#39;t allowed in there), and over to the singing puppies to scoop them both up in his arms at once, mouthing at their necks and shoulders with his own growls while the puppies squealed and garbled.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I&#39;m not sure how puppy rearing compares to child rearing, but in my experience baby fussing usually inevitably ends in nap piles - I&#39;ll leave you guys to it.&quot;
Slinging the strap over her shoulder, both hands made a quick pass through her hair to smooth it back down as she turned back to Skena.
&quot;Thanks for letting me invade your space for a little bit today - and thank you for the honey. I owe you one, food or drink or otherwise,&quot; she added, flashing a toothy grin.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As Niamh passed back through the portal exiting the odd but cozy cabin in the forest, she would be able to notice that shift in atmosphere--subtle though it was--and the little shiver of magic somewhere beneath her skin as she traveled at least a mile or so in one single, carefree stride. As the enchanted door closed behind her, she would find herself back in Finders Keepers, welcomed into the space with soft music coming from a record player somewhere nearby.

While the main room was the dedicated shop, filled with motley piles of clutter that didn&#39;t seem to adhere to any organizational structure hardly at all, the rooms beyond--one of which she now stood in--were not remotely comparable. They were well-kempt living spaces, with no piles, no bizarre junk immediately visible. No taxidermy, for certain. There were some bones, though.

It was a tastefully dim-lit space (predominantly decorated with shades of purple) with comfy seating, shelves on the wall lined in lovingly displayed crystals (in a nearly excessive quantity), dried flowers, <em>living</em> flowers, herbs and feathers and interesting sticks and stones and even the odd skull or two. There was a table with two chairs placed opposite each other against it, draped in a heavy, luxurious tablecloth of a deep indigo color, with an unlit candle in a beautiful silver candlestick holder that swirled up its wax base placed slightly off to the side, along with some more crystals. There were <em>so many</em> crystals. Also on this table was a single, ceramic mug, with what looked to be tea gently billowing steam from its surface. 

There was also a long, smooth pole in glossy black that ran from floor to ceiling, towards the side of the room opposite the available seating.

Approximately between the pole and the table, the resident tiefling appeared to be mid-exercise of some sort. She held herself perfectly still with her forearms braced on the ground, her body lifted vertically over them and legs gracefully arced back until her toes pointed towards the tips of her horns. Despite the precarious pose--and the fact that a black cat was loafing between her arms as a distraction--nothing in her anatomy looked strained.

The bright cyan fire of her eyes slid aside to eye Niamh as she entered, a lazy smile warming her features. &quot;Though I heard someone come in earlier,&quot; she purred easily in greeting.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The look of comfort and ease that had remained on Niamh&#39;s face quickly shifted to one of mild confusion upon crossing the threshold. This was not the staircase from earlier? It was much cozier than the staircase from earlier. And the rest of the front-facing parts of Finders Keepers for that matter. Taking a moment to marvel at the curated collections shelved around the room, her silence finally broke as she met the tiefling&#39;s gaze with a lopsided smile and proudly held the ugly taxidermy creature aloft.
&quot;Aye, I came by for some room decor - told Arsast to help me find something to rival my sleep paralysis demons. Gummy was a fan too,&quot; she added, examining the leg still slightly dampened by the... creature.

As the enchanted door closed behind her, she would find herself back in Finders Keepers, welcomed into the space with soft music coming from a record player somewhere nearby.

While the main room was the dedicated shop, filled with motley piles of clutter that didn&#39;t seem to adhere to any organizational structure hardly at all, the rooms beyond--one of which she now stood in--were not remotely comparable. They were well-kempt living spaces, with no piles, no bizarre junk immediately visible. No taxidermy, for certain. There were some bones, though.

It was a tastefully dim-lit space (predominantly decorated with shades of purple) with comfy seating, shelves on the wall lined in lovingly displayed crystals (in a nearly excessive quantity), dried flowers, <em>living</em> flowers, herbs and feathers and interesting sticks and stones and even the odd skull or two. There was a table with two chairs placed opposite each other against it, draped in a heavy, luxurious tablecloth of a deep indigo color, with an unlit candle in a beautiful silver candlestick holder that swirled up its wax base placed slightly off to the side, along with some more crystals. There were <em>so many</em> crystals. Also on this table was a single, ceramic mug, with what looked to be tea gently billowing steam from its surface. 

There was also a long, smooth pole in glossy black that ran from floor to ceiling, towards the side of the room opposite the available seating.

Approximately between the pole and the table, the resident tiefling appeared to be mid-exercise of some sort. She held herself perfectly still with her forearms braced on the ground, her body lifted vertically over them and legs gracefully arced back until her toes pointed towards the tips of her horns. Despite the precarious pose--and the fact that a black cat was loafing between her arms as a distraction--nothing in her anatomy looked strained.

The bright cyan fire of her eyes slid aside to eye Niamh as she entered, a lazy smile warming her features. &quot;Thought I heard someone come in earlier,&quot; she purred easily in greeting.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, October 1, 2022 11:40 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Taking a moment to marvel at the curated collections shelved around the room, her silence finally broke as she met the tiefling&#39;s gaze with a lopsided smile and proudly held the ugly taxidermy creature aloft.
&quot;Aye, I came by for some room decor - told Arsast to help me find something to rival my sleep paralysis demons. Gummy was a fan too,&quot; she added, examining the leg still slightly dampened by the... creature.
&quot;And Altaira had told me I could find Kaleva and Skena through your magic staircase, didn&#39; realize it led back out into your living room - I&#39;d&#39;ve brought more food.&quot; She offered a sheepish smile, tucking the small atrocity back under her arm and dropping slowly to a perch as she marveled at the little lump of Void settled between Ingrid&#39;s arms.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As she moved, gentle though it was, the cat directly under her gave a soft, curt meow that sounded suspiciously like a complaint. 

“Silence, wee thot,” Ingrid murmured lazily in reply.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her bare feet crossed, and she daintily lowered down to sit, setting the bowl between them. As soon as she sat down, the black cat--whose fur had a slight violet sheen when the light hit it just right--sashayed over to help herself into the tiefling&#39;s lap, like Ingrid sitting down had been done exclusively to provide the creature somewhere to lay down.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The easy smile melted into a grin as she watched the tiefling moving around the room, eventually sitting up to mirror her posture once they were both on the floor again.
&quot;I love it when you talk wicked.&quot; Peering into the bowl between them, her head tilted again as she sniffed quietly.
&quot;Something to burn?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Delilah--stop <em>fockin&#39;</em> diggin&#39; those bloody daggers intae me, I&#39;m <em>not turnin&#39; ye intae a spider again</em>.&quot; She gave the cat a pointed nudge, who didn&#39;t budge, but did give an unimpressed meow of a complaint. &quot;Not right now, at least. Keep this shite up an&#39; I&#39;ll turn ye intae a fockin&#39; peanut.&quot;

The cat was unmoved and unintimidated. But the threats rolled off Ingrid&#39;s tongue so casually, they were probably a dime a dozen--and likely all empty. She was, at least, fond enough of the cat to not eject her from her lap; really all she was doing was dramatically bitching about it, while permitting it to continue.

As she bitched away, she sorted through the ash and herbs in the bowl, all of which looked mildly singed. &quot;... Eh. Bit&#39;a lavender in there won&#39;t interfere. Probably. Maybe ye just get a familiar what smells lovely. In which case, ye bloody welcome.&quot;

She nudged the bowl and incense closer to Niamh. &quot;A&#39;ight. Ye do this ritual the first time, an&#39; ye summon a wee spirit from another plane tae be ye familiar. Delilah here is fey. Far as I&#39;m aware, familiars are pulled from either the feywilds, heaven, or hell. Now, there <em>are</em> right an&#39; wrong choices. But that&#39;s up tae ye,&quot; she stated, the languid cadence of her declarations making it a bit hard to tell if she was joking or stone cold serious. 

&quot;But ye gonna need tae get used tae casting the spell. Especially if ye out fockin&#39; around with dangerous shite. If ye critter so much as stubs its wee toe, chances are, it&#39;s goin&#39; back tae the realm from whence it came. So ye cast the spell again--an&#39; it brings back the same spirit. No continuity errors regardin&#39; ye relationship with &#39;em. Same bastard. Ye donnae have tae wait for it tae croak, either; ye can recast the magic when tae fock ever, and instead of summonin&#39; it again, it allows ye tae change they shape. Delilah very much prefers bein&#39; a cat, &#39;cause it&#39;s the vessel of whores an&#39; tiny entitled villains, but she makes a lovely snake as well. Think ye can manage some birds an&#39; shite too. Maybe a fish. Fock if I know. Look it up.&quot;

She pointed to the bowl with a perfectly manicured talon of a nail. &quot;Brass bowl. Incense, herbs, an&#39; charcoal. Good shite, too--like <em>this was me fancy date night money</em> good. Buy more than ye need when ye can, so ye can cast the magic in a pinch if someone sneezes on ye funky frog mate and sends it back tae hell. I promise, ye gonna be bloody pissed if ye have tae wait tae find the materials again before ye can bring the wee menace back tae this plane. Takes a good while for the spell tae finish, too. Cannae do it on a hike, takes a good hour to complete, so keep the piece of shite alive whenever possible. They donnae <em>die</em> proper, tend tae <em>poof</em> away before they even have a bad experience--but bringin&#39; it back is bloody inconvenient.&quot;

Delilah&#39;s pretty blue eyes had squinted almost all the way closed by now. Everything in this room clearly only existed to benefit her. Her current chair was a little noisy, but it was warm, at least.

&quot;Now, light that shite on fire. As it burns, ye spend the next hour drawin&#39; on wherever ye source of moon magic shite is, an&#39; ye use that energy tae shape the flame. Mold it like clay. Takes some gettin&#39; used tae, &#39;cus it&#39;s <em>nae</em> clay. Odd experience. But as the spell goes on, it takes shape easier an&#39; easier. Have a creature in mind as ye work. When ye done, be polite an&#39; introduce yeself.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not exactly a common expression for her to wear.
Her sharp eyes followed the tiefling&#39;s hands, flickering between the components and the tools and Delilah as the process was explained. These were terms she could understand. This wasn&#39;t poring over a bland textbook trying to make sense of arcana arrogance. And Ingrid was a better teacher than she had been hoping for.
Taking a moment to register the last of the instructions, she straightened her back and squared her shoulders, staring into the bowl&#39;s contents as she considered the suggestion. A creature in mind - she could choose? There were so many to consider, so many different skills and abilities that would be useful in a companion. Maybe she could just...
The charred contents of the bowl set alight with ease, and she felt the sudden weight of something pliable but unseen beneath her fingertips. Her usual grin set back onto her face, she went to work.

It had been longer than Ingrid&#39;s estimated hour by the time she finished. &#39;Finished.&#39; Where she&#39;d started had been with confidence, but it had slowly waned as time passed and she realized she didnt recognize what was taking shape beneath her hands. It was... Cute? About the size of Delilah, she&#39;d determined early on that cat size was a great size. The tail was long though, prehensile, and a furred membrane stretched between the front and back feet - little grippy toes with even littler claws. Its head was nearly spherical, and two equally round little ears flanked a pair of wide black eyes. Not a single thought behind them.
Exasperated, she stretched some of the limbs, curled the tail around her finger, stretched out his too-long tongue as if testing their staying power. With one foot pinched in each hand, she held him aloft and looked desperately back up at Ingrid.
&quot;Um.&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, October 7, 2022 12:17 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She had more patience and attention span than Arsast by a landslide, but not nearly enough to have her sitting there with Niamh, staring at her for over an hour. By the time the spell had been concluded, Ingrid had taken a shower and gotten something to nibble on, managing to shove some food into Arsast somewhere along the way. The background music of Niamh&#39;s foray into familiar-summoning was the occasional odd or concerning noise, fey gibberish shot back and forth across the house, and all manner of random strangeness or dialogue that would have certainly tested Niamh&#39;s ability to stay focused. 

By the time the magic concluded, Ingrid was lazily putzing about the room in a silk robe that slouched scandalously off her shoulders, her cup of tea having been renewed with something freshly steaming. She paused as Niamh gave her concerned declaration, glancing over. 

She blinked at the creature blankly. Then looked back to Niamh. &quot;<em>Um</em>?&quot; She echoed. &quot;Bitch--ye the one that made it, donnae <em>um</em> me like I can explain that. HEY ARS--&quot; She continued in a suddenly raised voice, &quot;COME LOOK AT THIS SHITE, YE LOVE IT.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He skidded to a stop, almost tripping right over the top of Niamh and her new familiar, lilac purple eyes gone wide as he clamped his hands on her shoulders to keep from toppling over her.

Arsast&#39;s eyes met with those of the familiar, and not a single thought passed between them.

&quot;<em>Ooohhhh,</em>&quot; Arsast whispered.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Um. Right. Hello there, uh, good afternoo-&quot; her greeting cut off into a garbled yelp as the creature&#39;s mouth popped open with a soft grumbling noise and a burp, and a tiny acidic globule careened free from his mouth to Arsast&#39;s forehead.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
