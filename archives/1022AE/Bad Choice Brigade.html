Production of spore was underway, and Jaska had established contacts in several nearby towns to start selling the product. Money was rolling in, and Jaska was finally able to purchase a house for him and Axa.

Of course, now that he had a house, he needed things to fill it with. Furniture was easy enough. Decorations were something else entirely.

The concept of decorating his space was so alien to him. He&#39;d never really had his own space. He&#39;d always shared it with someone. And Valentine understandably didn&#39;t have much in the way of decoration.

So without anything concrete in mind, he settled for wandering various shops, simply looking for anything that caught his eye. Which is how he found himself meandering into Lost &amp; Found. The door chimed as it opened, and he heard a cheerful voice call out from somewhere in the back, &quot;Fuck! Ingrid, could you get that? I&#39;m stuck!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
<div class=chatlog__message-group><div id=chatlog__message-container-944481787042758676 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=944481787042758676><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><img class=chatlog__avatar src="/icons/Daarka.png" alt=Avatar loading=lazy></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__header><span class=chatlog__author style=color:rgb(192,106,155) title=daarka data-user-id=164583493953650688>Daarka</span> <span class=chatlog__timestamp title="Friday, February 18, 2022 10:33 PM"><a href=#chatlog__message-container-944481787042758676>2/18/2022 10:33 PM</a></span></div><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Tae fock ye stuck in now? They cannae possibly be any more coins under the loveseat since ye looked two hours ago ye wee shite--&quot;

The tiefling co-owner of the shop pushed through a curtain of iridescent beads that lightly obscured an adjoining room through a doorway to the right of Jaska&#39;s entrance, wearing a semi-sheer, baggy shirt of a pretty deep blue color, with the silhouette of a bralette and booty shorts visible under the loose fabric. Her impossibly long dreadlocks hung loose, nearly brushing against the floor as she sashayed into the main room with her equally ridiculously long tail swirling after her.

A perfectly charming smile illuminated her expression as she laid eyes on their guests, opening her hands in greeting. &quot;Welcome! Feel free tae have a look-see around, do give me a shout if ye have any questions or might be lookin&#39; for somethin&#39; specific--though no promises in that regard. An&#39; tarot readin&#39;s are a gold piece each.&quot;

The little child shuffling in at Jaska&#39;s heels was doing her best to take in everything in the shop with those pink, owlish eyes, but there was... a lot. So she stuck close to Jaska&#39;s leg.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I&#39;ll figure this out!&quot;

Jaska was clearly rethinking his presence in this particular establishment. He looked over at Ingrid, brows slightly raised, but gave her a nod in return. &quot;I have no idea what I&#39;m looking for; just browsing.&quot; Looking around at all the different objects, he ventured hesitantly, &quot;Decorative things, mostly.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Genuinely one of the tamer things to be happening to the unsupervised satyr.

On bare feet, she deftly navigated the chaotic space, tapping her chin absentmindedly. &quot;What&#39;s the <em>aesthetic</em> ye goin&#39; for, beloved? It&#39;s quite motley in here--but I have a half decent memory of what&#39;s in what corner. An&#39; fancy bloke like yeself surely has his tastes.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Glancing down to the small girl at his side, he tipped his head enough to try to make eye contact and let her know he was speaking to her, next. &quot;If you see anything you like, point it out to me. We&#39;re shopping for you, too, so you can decorate your room how you like it.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She looked back at him for a moment, before slowly looking around, giving Ingrid a wary glance, and then hesitantly breaking away from Jaska&#39;s shadow to start slinking through the shop. And almost immediately effectively vanishing.

Ingrid looked after the little girl for as long as she could keep eyes on her, but ultimately didn&#39;t seem fussed that a child had gone rogue in her place of business. She wasn&#39;t the fucking parent.

&quot;Well, we do have trashy an&#39; gaudy, &#39;cause the focker who presently is stuck on a deer head is what the delicate folks call <em>eccentric</em>. But we got nicer things, too... let&#39;s see...&quot; 

She navigated the space effortlessly, poking around with some idle hums. &quot;Donnae think I&#39;ve seen ye lovely face around town before. Ye new here, handsome?&quot; She chatted over her shoulder, the flattery and charming small talk being navigated just as effortlessly.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Does this count as me getting head?&quot; came Arsast&#39;s voice from the back. Apparently he forgot there were customers. Or he didn&#39;t care and thought this was acceptable talk to have around strangers.

Jaska reached up to pinch the bridge of his nose, mismatched eyes squinted faintly. &quot;I&#39;ve been around town for... almost a year, now. My sister is the bartender at the Creeping Root Inn.&quot; He followed her around, though he paused mid-stride and turned toward one of the shelves, picking up an ashtray he rather liked the look of, turning it over in his hands and feeling its weight. It was heavy, probably solid glass or possibly crystal, the interior and top decorated with rich, earthy brown crackling.

He could probably kill someone with it. Which solidified his decision, and he kept it in hand as he resumed following Ingrid.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-944492249163661362 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=944492249163661362><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, February 18, 2022 11:15 PM">11:15 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__embed><a href=https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/1odEBPwQQ1qz7QVlyW2vZOQ1obKLsjcslFnP3Xr9Ei0/https/ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1KI6eTgHqK1RjSZFkq6x.WFXaV/High-end-4-Holders-Glass-Cigar-Ashtray-Home-Decorative-Smoking-Ash-Tray-Tobacco-Leaf-Glass-Ashtray.jpg_Q90.jpg_.webp> <img class=chatlog__embed-generic-image src=https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/1odEBPwQQ1qz7QVlyW2vZOQ1obKLsjcslFnP3Xr9Ei0/https/ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1KI6eTgHqK1RjSZFkq6x.WFXaV/High-end-4-Holders-Glass-Cigar-Ashtray-Home-Decorative-Smoking-Ash-Tray-Tobacco-Leaf-Glass-Ashtray.jpg_Q90.jpg_.webp alt="Embedded image" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

Seamlessly, she glanced back over to Jaska with that same charming smile. &quot;Miss Valentine? Oh I do see the resemblance, aye.

Jaska soon decided that ignoring the shop&#39;s other occupant was probably in his patience&#39;s best interests, and met Ingrid&#39;s eyes at her smile. &quot;That would be Luka,&quot; he said with a slight droll to his voice that didn&#39;t hide the fact he clearly didn&#39;t have a very high opinion of his brother. &quot;Runs the new massage parlor in town. I forget the name.&quot; More like he never bothered to learn it.

&quot;I&#39;ve finally gotten my own place, and now it&#39;s just a task of... making it look lived in, I suppose. Most places seem to hang pictures on walls, paintings and whatnot, but if I&#39;m honest, I don&#39;t understand the point? Still lifes of bowls of fruit? Landscapes?

&quot;Ah, Luka, that&#39;s right. Seems nice enough, but, ah... bit <em>mousy</em> for me tastes. Donnae get me wrong, there&#39;s somethin&#39; tae be said for the appeal of a virgin&#39;s demeanor, but... then there&#39;s the folks what seem like they&#39;d mortally wound themselves by sneezin&#39; too hard.

She snickered at his talk of paintings. &quot;Well... some folks like the ambiance of it. But shite ye describin&#39;--no, love, I donnae see the appeal of it either. <em>However</em>--&quot; she half-pivoted back to him, holding up a finger, &quot;Such things are quite unassumin&#39;.

Stopping, she stretched to lean over a small table, reaching through the clutter towards something only she seemed to be aware existed in those heaps, and not seeming remotely bothered to be consequentially sticking her ass up at an acute angle with shorts on that barely qualified as more than panties. She was comfortable in her own skin, that was for sure. 

It only lasted a second or two, however, before she straightened up again, holding a sort of candle holder, all one long piece and designed to hold multiple candle sticks in a row. &quot;Ye use candles, beloved?

I could get her some larger canvases and frame those. They would draw attention, sure, but likely not to the extent someone would easily think they were concealing something.&quot;

There was some hidden joke there. From his tone, he clearly didn&#39;t think her works to be boring or mind-numbing... And the edge of deviousness to his tone suggested that her drawings probably weren&#39;t your typical innocent children&#39;s drawings either.

He was distracted briefly as she leaned over, and his gaze roamed over the offered bottom, an edge of sly appreciation as he took in the sight. As she straightened up, he tore his gaze back up to her face, then the offered item, taking it in hand to look it over. &quot;Not usually...

He called out after a moment, &quot;Axa, child? Have you found anything to your liking?&quot;

From the back, there was a muffled, &quot;Oh, shit, whoops,&quot; as Arsast realized there was a child that had heard all his nonsense.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ingrid quirked a brow, tilting her head to try to see around the obstacles between her and the sound. From somewhere on the other side of the room came the hiss of a very displeased feline, followed after a moment by the faint voice of Axa. &quot;No.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Better to say it and prevent it possibly happening than to say nothing and wind up with a highly unfortunate event.

&quot;I&#39;ll just take these, then, thank you,&quot; he said to Ingrid, making his way back to the front. He paused along the way, and nodded to a crystal whiskey decanter with matching glasses. &quot;And those.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

With a little puff of glittery magic, a hiss across the room cut off mid-sound, and then picked up again as a black cat apparated in Ingrid&#39;s arms. It was a pleasantly round little creature with folded ears and icy blue eyes, the slightest violet sheen to its inky black fur--and a look of long-suffering annoyance on its face. But the cat did not protest to Ingrid settling her snugly into her arms, giving her cheek a rub as she chided her. 

&quot;Ye not bloody nice tae anyone--an&#39; I <em>know</em> ye as sick of Ars&#39; shite as the next guy, but ye usually at least haughtily ignore children, not give &#39;em a piece of ye tiny mind. If ye cannae stop takin&#39; the piss, I&#39;m puttin&#39; ye away.&quot;

The cat sank into a sourly dignified squint, pooled into a black blob in the tiefling&#39;s arms, as Ingrid made her way to what appeared to be the front counter, seamlessly turning her attention back towards Jaska&#39;s armful. &quot;Let&#39;s call it two silver, beloved. An&#39; that&#39;s after the pretty face discount.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Passing over the coin, he paused briefly as a small satyr popped out the back, took one look at the items being bought, and then ducked into the back room again to get some newspapers to wrap the delicates in, and a box to carry it. Once Arsast was getting the things prepared, he looked back to Ingrid. &quot;So. You mentioned tarot readings cost a gold.

Resting the cat on the countertop, she placed her elbows against the surface on either side of her, leaning forward with a grin like she was sharing an in-joke between old friends. &quot;Ye feel up for some <em>intimacy,</em> handsome?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She didn&#39;t move to tuck the coin away anywhere, but it was simply no longer in her hand as she stood up straight again, leaving Delilah to loaf on the counter as she headed out from behind the desk and towards the beaded curtain--though only just managing to stop on a dime so she didn&#39;t trip over the little girl that was just suddenly There. With a swirl of her tail to regain her balance, she blinked a few times, before relaxing again and glancing over her shoulder. &quot;I&#39;ve found ye wee beastie,&quot; she announced lackadaisically, stepping around the girl with an added murmur of, &quot;Quiet little thing, ain&#39;t ye?&quot; Despite the overly casual addressing of the child, her tone didn&#39;t seem... dismissive or rude. Certainly not derogatory. She simply didn&#39;t seem to altogether know how to handle children, and so--to the delight of many a child--defaulted to treating them indistinguishably from adults instead of transitioning into some sort of baby voice around them.

Axa eyed her a bit cautiously, though that was typical for her with strangers. Ingrid may or may not have seen the little bundle of black silk ribbon in Axa&#39;s little fingers, but if she was aware of it, it didn&#39;t seem to warrant a comment as she made her way to the sparkly beaded curtain, a hand gracefully sweeping it aside as she half-turned to beckon her guest(s) to follow.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Dipping his head slightly as he went through the beaded curtain, one arm lifted to sweep the beads aside, giving Axa a moment to slip past before letting them fall once more. &quot;So how does this work, exactly?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

This space, while a bit smaller, was well kempt and decorated deliberately, with the earthy smell of incense lingering in the air. Shelves were adorned in crystals, herbs, even bones, and various random items that, despite their randomness, all seemed to uniformly belong to this space. An adorably small kitchenette looked almost like it existed solely to brew tea, and towards the entrance was a table with a chair on either side, draped in a starry tapestry of a tablecloth, and holding several candles that lazily burned away. 

And roughly in the center of the room, but a bit off to the side, the area was clear save for a glossy black pole that ran from the floor directly into the ceiling.

Ingrid comfortably plopped down into the seat at the table that faced the entrance, gesturing for Jaska to sit as well. &quot;It&#39;s <em>terribly</em> invasive, ye see,&quot; she replied coyly, swirling her long, elegant fingers through the air. In the wake of her perfectly manicured claws, rows of cards began to apparate, delicately floating into her waiting grasp. The backs of each card were identical; almost velvety in appearance, and shifting in hue between maroon, violet, and indigo as they shifted in the light.

She placed the conjured deck down neatly on the table between them, and with the practiced ease of any showman, a single flick of her finger sent all the cards rippling over until they all lay face-up.

But they had no faces. Every single card was an identical, pearlescent blank slate, lined in golden filigree. 

&quot;These ain&#39;t ye typical tarot cards,&quot; she hummed, another graceful motion flipping them back face-down, and gathering them again into a neat deck. &quot;Have ye ever had a readin&#39; before, love?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her words drew his attention back to her, and he walked over to sit down across from her at the table, giving his vest a slight tug to settle it into place and then folding one leg over the other. &quot;Never. Always thought it was a load of rubbish. Cards with descriptions that were vague enough to encourage people to relate to them and therefore believe that they truly divined the future, read the past, or whatever else.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ingrid chuckled, a thumb running over the corners of the stacked cards to create a soft <em>fthp-thp-thp-thp-thp</em>. &quot;Oh, aye, that&#39;s a rampant practice. But see, as I&#39;ve said, me cards are special. They <em>attune</em> tae ye. This isnae some parlor trick. Nor do I have tae let <em>you</em> shuffle an&#39; draw tae give some illusion that ye actually related tae the results.&quot;

With a simple but elegant flourish, three cards were spread alongside each other on the table&#39;s surface all in one motion. Then, with a slightly more reverent gesture, a fourth was placed perpendicular, above the row of three. The deck was then tucked aside. 

Her fingers swirled up through the air, and each of the four placed cards flipped over on their own, once again revealing those blank, identical faces, as Ingrid eyed Jaska with a somewhat sly grin, as if proving her point as extensively as she could that there was no funny business about. With the same touchless gesture, the cards returned to being face-down, and she lowered a finger to rest her pale pink, iridescent nail over the leftmost card. 

&quot;This card speaks of ye past,&quot; she explained, before her finger moved to tap the middle card, &quot;This of ye present,&quot; and then a tap on the rightmost card, &quot;An&#39; this of ye future. Simple enough, aye?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She knew what she was doing.

With another pretty motion, she flipped over the first card. It was no longer blank; instead, its face was filled with simple shapes in shades of dark purple that illustrated the silhouette of a man. But the frame of his body was like a vessel, half filled with some sort of liquid, within which was the shape of another man, looking to be sinking--but desperately clawing his way for the surface. Drowning.

Ingrid placed her elbow on the table&#39;s surface, casually resting her chin on the back of her hand. &quot;Ye past is... quite the strange one, hm? Trapped in a unique sort of prison, barely able tae touch the outside world--an&#39; with the world ye sought from the outside crashin&#39; on the walls of this prison before it could reach ye.&quot; That smugness had ebbed from her demeanor, replaced instead with something... respectful. Gentle.

Her finger traced thoughtfully over the outline of the outer man, eyes heavily lidded. &quot;A sense of bein&#39; forced tae exist behind a mask not of ye own choosin&#39;.

He wondered, briefly, if he should get up and leave. There was a flicker in his eyes, foreboding, perhaps an edge of fear for what she would unearth, before it settled back into that grim countenance. As her gaze lifted to his face, he raised his own to meet hers, utterly silent. The twin tips of his tails were raised, the feathered tips utterly still, like a pair of vipers poised to strike.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Nor anything pitying. Just a quiet, steady respect and an appropriate degree of softness. She knew she was handling something fragile.

&quot;I can respect the power of spite,&quot; she continued, a soft smile toying at her lips. She kept an eye on him to see if he would stop her--consent was important--but assuming he did not, her hand floated to the side to turn over the middle card. 

This one was also freshly illustrated. It depicted the silhouette of a man again, this one resembling the one who was drowning in the first card. But he was no longer drowning. Though water still dripped off his frame, he was on dry land, being pulled from the edge of the water by the nondescript shape of a woman, their forearms clasped together. But with his free hand, he was still reaching behind himself, and that forearm was clasped with that of a third figure, equally nondescript, but... notably smaller than the others. The water that streaked off the man&#39;s body was artfully depicted in gold leaf foil, pooling at his feet like treasure.

&quot;Mm. But ye have overcome that nasty beginning. Not by yeself... ye have someone lookin&#39; out for ye. Someone who loves ye unconditionally. And... ye accept that love, best that ye can. Ye out from behind that mask, that prison--an&#39; ye full of ambition. Which is good. Ye deserve ye own successes. But amidst it all... ye found the opportunity tae be selfless. Tae pay ye turn of fortune forward, an&#39; save another sad soul from their own prison. Ye found the roots of ye own unconditional love, an&#39; ye stronger for it.&quot;

She quirked a brow, ghosting her claw over the streaks of gold. &quot;An&#39; ye reapin&#39; the rewards of ye blood, sweat, an&#39; tears. Earnin&#39; everythin&#39; ye got, an&#39; not earnin&#39; meagerly, either.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ingrid was yet again spot on in her assessment... And as she went on to describe the unconditional love that he found, his arms slowly, securely wrapped around Axa to cradle her snugly back against his chest, watching everything unfold over the top of her head.

It seemed Ingrid&#39;s handling of things was coaxing him back down from that fragile state, into something a bit more like acceptance. It was strange to think that someone else was now at least marginally informed of his past who wasn&#39;t one of his siblings. He couldn&#39;t help but wonder just how much she saw.

But now, with the past and the present accurately presented, any doubts clearly dispersed, there was the future to consider. And that&#39;s where his focus and curiosity sharpened, moving to the third card... and glancing briefly at that mysterious fourth.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But his touch was soft around her, and the gentle constriction of his embrace was comforting, so everything was probably okay.

Ingrid&#39;s gentle smile remained as she moved to turn over the third card. As would be expected by now, it, too, bore a new illustration. 

The man who had once been drowning, and then most recently been crawling from the water and fighting to get his feet underneath him, was now standing straight and regal. Water no longer dripped from him, but the gold foil accents had returned in the form of a crown floating ethereally over his head, and gold like liquid pouring from his hands where it gathered at his feet in the shape of an intimidating fortress. Silhouettes of people, too simple to discern even gender, were subtly visible standing behind him, but the fortress his hands created sat domineering over the body of water that had once soaked him.

&quot;Ah... an&#39; ye future is a rich one, beloved. All ye needed was... tae be heard, I think. Tae have ye voice be received as the words of a man who speaks for himself. An&#39; <em>look</em> at the things ye capable of now. The spite got ye out of ye prison, but... there is... an unusual breed of wisdom here. Spite served its purpose, an&#39; now... now ye can be smart. Methodical. Calculated. Strategic. An&#39; it turns out ye quite brilliant with such things, ain&#39;t ye? Ye able tae finally stand on ye own where ye can shine, an&#39; mediocrity just doesnae suit ye, beloved. Despite all the tumultuous loneliness from ye past, the hurt ye carried that made ye like a cornered animal... ye have allies now. Some closer than others, but allies all the same. An&#39; ye cultivate them. Nurture &#39;em. Respect &#39;em. Ye findin&#39; ye stride, an&#39; makin&#39; this world work for you for a change.&quot;

She turned over her hand to rest her chin in her palm, a small but lighthearted smile on her face. &quot;That&#39;s quite a lovely card, aye?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He flicked his gaze back to her, and then to the fourth card, lifting a hand to gesture toward it. &quot;And what of this last one? If past, present, and future are covered, what&#39;s left to represent?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

See, I&#39;m a very depraved soul, but one of my biggest pleasures is perfectly wholesome. There&#39;s nothin&#39; I love more than hearin&#39; folks talk about those they love. This card is ye heart, because in its own way, it&#39;s just as important as the past, present, an&#39; future.&quot;

She nimbly turned it face up. The simple image of the man was back, though neither crowned in gold nor dripping in water. Just... simply himself. His arms encircled the simplified silhouette of what looked to be a young woman, while behind him, the shape of another woman stood back to back with him. As Ingrid tipped her head thoughtfully to regard the illustration, her gaze was soft and warm. 

&quot;Ye never really had the tools tae know how tae trust some people, I think. Lust is one thing, but romance... it&#39;s not quite ye speed. At least, not at this part of ye life. Family, however... Family is where ye draw ye strength. Family is the people who ye&#39;d kill for, an&#39; who&#39;d kill for you, too. Ye not particularly used tae showin&#39; affection in the traditional methods, but one of the highest honors anyone could have from ye is tae be let into ye inner circle. Ye donnae always reciprocate overtly,&quot; she continued, tapping the card. &quot;Ye not even facin&#39; this individual here. Yet she&#39;s on the card all the same, trusted tae be behind ye where ye cannae see her, and honorin&#39; that position by watchin&#39; where ye cannae see tae keep ye safe. Meanwhile... ye <em>do</em> express overt love for this lass,&quot; she went on, her finger shifting slightly to indicate the figure the man was encircling. &quot;Ye&#39;d do anythin&#39; for her. There&#39;s... a mirror there. Ye see yeself in her--enough that ye want tae be the savior for her that no one ever was for ye. Ye&#39;d raze the world tae ashes before lettin&#39; her endure the same,&quot; she said, tipping her head towards the first card of his past, the drowning man.

&quot;An&#39; that&#39;s divine, beloved. She was small when ye saved her,&quot; she added, gesturing to the middle card, &quot;but under your care, she blossoms intae an adult of her own.&quot; She lifted her gaze, those eyes briefly passing over the little girl on his lap. Context clues made some things easy to guess, but she found it unprofessional to pose such definitive connections out loud. They were for the client to interpret personally, not for her to dictate. 

&quot;An&#39; I get the feelin&#39; that, but for that sproutin&#39; of unconditional love, that drive tae save her from a torment ye were personally familiar with, she wouldnae have that opportunity. May not even have a life at all. From the ashes of all that has sought tae destroy ye... ye chose tae be resurrected not with short-sighted vengeance or indiscriminate hate, but with a love that would break the cycle that created you.&quot;

Her eyes were soft, tender. Reverent. She didn&#39;t have to say out loud that she found his story beautiful; it was written on her face. 

&quot;Quite the interestin&#39; man. An&#39; yet, the sly bastard never even told me his name,&quot; she added with a slight smirk.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But then she flipped the card and told the story she saw, and he felt something in him grow... Quiet. Peaceful.

Yes, that was acceptable.

Her last comment had him bestowing her with a smirk of his own. &quot;How rude of me. My name is Jaska. And as you&#39;ve likely picked up by now, this is my daughter, Axa.&quot;

Sitting up a bit straighter, he tipped his head and admitted, lowly, &quot;That&#39;s quite the gift. A little odd to pay someone to tell me things about my life I already knew, but I suppose there&#39;s novelty there.&quot;

One brow raised as he wondered if he could somehow use that to his advantage. So he added after a moment, &quot;It&#39;s an interesting way to gather information about people at any rate.

The cat is Delilah, but donnae talk tae her, or she&#39;ll try tae sell ye drugs.&quot;

She tipped her head with an amused grin at his question. &quot;Oh, quite the scandalous curiosity there. But it&#39;s a bit nuanced,&quot; she replied thoughtfully, spreading her hands through the air as the remaining deck fluttered from one palm to the other. 

&quot;These readings draw on an attunement tae the threads of fate that push an&#39; pull us through life. An unspoken rule I&#39;ve come tae understand in wieldin&#39; these cards is that we are only entitled, in a cosmic sense, tae our own stories. Now, if I thought Ars was gonna betray me or some shite... perhaps I could ask the cards. That&#39;s lookin&#39; intae me own future, yeah? Not unveilin&#39; his story behind his back.&quot;

Her fingers flexed, and the deck bowed out slightly, until the card off the top popped free, twisting through the air, before landing face-up on the table. It depicted an illustration, just as simple and stylized as Jaska&#39;s cards had been, that showed a male and a female of identical height, arms linked as they looked at each other with downright mischievous grins. 

Ingrid regarded the card as if she already knew what it would show, giving it a patient and nonplussed smile. &quot;Pity. Looks like I&#39;m stuck with the wee shite.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ingrid smiled, an appreciative look on her face. &quot;I do see the resemblance, aye. Lucky wee lass tae have ye carin&#39; for her.&quot;

Axa may or may not have been listening, now zoning out comfortably in Jaska&#39;s arms. Whatever tension had maybe existed seemed to have passed, and she was content to exist quietly in her own space, her fingers still idly running across the silk ribbon she had procured from... somewhere.

Ingrid watched with a warm, quiet smile. Kids weren&#39;t really her thing, but this one was inoffensive and seemingly civilized--and more importantly, the soft interactions between father and daughter were delightful to witness. 

She leaned forward over the table top, resting her forearms on the surface. &quot;That&#39;s silk, innit, love? Ye like that material?&quot;

Axa glanced hesitantly in Ingrid&#39;s direction, though avoiding looking her in the face. A second went by to process the question, but instead of answering, she looked back to Jaska. Whether she was just being feral and shy, or if something about the question was confusing to her was anyone&#39;s guess.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It probably was a delight to witness. Jaska did not look like a person that really did tender or loving. He carried an air of self confidence with a subtle edge of deadly threat, someone who was all too familiar with violence. He even moved with a sort of predatory slink. But around this child, even though he seemed to retain a distant expression, he... softened. Still dangerous, still a predator, but protective.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ingrid didn&#39;t seem to mind, her smile persisting as she pushed herself to her feet. &quot;Gimme a second, I gotta find somethin&#39;...&quot;

With a swishing gait that moved her fluidly across the room, she disappeared behind the beaded curtain again, dipping back out into the main shop on her own. There were faint sounds of rummaging, but nothing too chaotic sounding; she seemed to navigate the clutter with the delicate and weightless steps of a dancer. 

It didn&#39;t take her terribly long to return. When she did, it was with a flat canvas sack, which she pulled open as she approached Jaska again, reaching in to pull out a clean, off-white rectangle of silky fabric. 

&quot;Ye can put this over ye pillow so ye fall asleep against that pretty fabric,&quot; she explained, her fingers catching in the pillowcase&#39;s opening to show its shape. &quot;Or ye can just have it tae hold an&#39; mess with on its own.

With that done, he turned his head to press a kiss to her cheek and straightened up, returning his gaze to Ingrid with a thoughtful smirk. &quot;We should be on our way.

Jaska had taken note of the store hours on his way out with his things, and a couple of days later had arranged for Axa to visit Auntie Valentine (and probably Luka) for a sleepover while he went on the prowl.

Near closing time he stepped into the shop, and when the bell chimed over the door, Arsast popped up from behind the counter. &quot;Hi! We close in like ten minutes so I hope you&#39;re not here to browse - oh it&#39;s you!&quot;

&quot;Yes, hello.&quot; He&#39;d have probably not been quite so patient if not for his comparison with Ingrid of their mutual struggles. &quot;I&#39;m looking for Ingrid, is she around?&quot;

The petite tiefling swirled around it with an effortless fluidity that made even the more impressive of the displays look like anyone could do them, her long dreadlocks and longer tail dancing through the air behind her like decorative streamers. She was dressed just as minimally as when Jaska had met her in days prior, wearing comfortable looking, but very scarce shorts and a matching crop top. Still just as barefoot; it was probable that there had been no shoes at all in the days since he saw her last. 

Ingrid dancing was like a fish in water, perfectly in her element to the extent that the look on her face barely seemed fully awake.

&quot;Scandalous... because if the shop&#39;s closed, ye cannae be comin&#39; tae shop, can ye?&quot; She hummed, her voice betraying no signs of breathlessness despite her activity.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-945533030867566682 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=945533030867566682><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, February 21, 2022 8:10 PM">8:10 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>( <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@simonaspataro_/video/6945768993823182086">https://www.tiktok.com/@simonaspataro_/video/6945768993823182086</a> )</span></div></div></div></div></div>

On his way home, he stopped by one of the restaurants to order food and a bottle of wine, and once there set the table, portioning out the shrimp scampi, pasta, and asparagus onto covered plates to keep them warm. The pinot grigio was a crisp white wine that would compliment the seafood well, and in the icebox he kept two slices of tiramisu for dessert.

The house itself was decently sized, keeping to the sort of casual elegance that Jaska seemed to prefer, not overly fancy but not homely either. Still a bit lacking in decoration inside, but what was there showed his tastes - which seemed to walk the line between gothic victorian and steampunk. Rich, earthy shades that tended toward browns and reds and maroons, accented with gold or brass or copper.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not because she had actually been late, but because she was <em>that</em> person who found one&#39;s timeliness to be implicative of some nuance in a power dynamic... and those were delicate threads she pulled in every situation she found herself in.

If nothing else, because it entertained her.

She was finally wearing shoes, in the form of heels with the heel themselves made out of clusters of crystals. It was all or nothing when it came to her footwear. Despite not attending a restaurant, she had elected to dress up, too, it seemed--though to say she was dressed would be a subjective statement. It <em>was</em> a dress, but with a v-neck that split down to her naval, pulled apart to reveal an elaborate bra made of leather straps. Likewise, the skirt--which fell to her ankles--was split twice, once over the front of each thigh, with the cut running up all the way to the waistband. Those exposed thighs sported more straps in an elaborate pair of garters, with the whole ensemble being in deep shades of violets and indigos that suited her look perfectly. She didn&#39;t wear much in the way of jewelry, but she did have on two earrings bearing crystals that matched those on her shoes, and countless places in her hair were adorned in pearlescent bands around individual dreadlocks, all of which were mostly left hanging, though two clusters of locks from either side of her face were pulled back around the crown of her head, following the shape her horns took around her skull, like ombre laurels. 

She gave the door a knock, not looking the slightest bit bothered by the wintery chill of the evening air despite what she was wearing. <span class="chatlog__markdown-spoiler chatlog__markdown-spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"><a href="https://youtu.be/ddSpvTGRkzk">https://youtu.be/ddSpvTGRkzk</a></span></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-945564575053545472 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=945564575053545472><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, February 21, 2022 10:16 PM">10:16 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/944465563684593695/945564573396766790/51asilver-2000x2222.png?ex=655c4b22&amp;is=6549d622&amp;hm=8f4f7e9076c614a4975af540a0f794a82b718349a15b451fe98cfa869709e7ec&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/944465563684593695/945564573396766790/51asilver-2000x2222.png?ex=655c4b22&amp;is=6549d622&amp;hm=8f4f7e9076c614a4975af540a0f794a82b718349a15b451fe98cfa869709e7ec&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: 51asilver-2000x2222.png (3.16 MB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

Many men would assume they were getting laid based on that outfit and earlier context. But that was part of the game, wasn&#39;t it? He could assume nothing yet, and Ingrid struck him as the type of cock tease to hint at such things and then simply thank him for a lovely evening and be on her way.

Clearing his throat, he stepped aside and held the door open for her. &quot;Quite a statement with that outfit. Please, do come in.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She brought no coat, no purse, nothing to be chivalrously relieved of at the door, and so she took a moment to look around instead, her expression only changing when her gaze landed on a familiar oil lamp.

There were a couple of framed pictures along the way. A bit small, on standard parchment paper, drawings done in colored pencils.

Horrific, aberrant monstrosities stared out from them. Unsettling and ghastly. These must have been the drawings he was referring to, the ones done by his daughter. They turned an otherwise pleasant, if slightly archaic aesthetic into something deeply unsettling. Like a haunted house.

The kitchen and dining room area, at least, looked normal. Wood wainscoting, plum purple walls, copper sconces and light fixtures. And the dinner, set out and ready at a small table.
