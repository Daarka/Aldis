He seemed to have a natural inclination for assisting others and for following others&#39; leads, but demonstrated an ability to take charge if need be for the safety of others. His horse, a gray kladruber mare he&#39;d named Arianwyn, was well trained, fearless and steady.

Achoris has parted ways with them once they&#39;d left the desert, and more than once Ilex had glanced regretfully back toward the fallen Aasimar, apparently saddened that they&#39;d only had a few short days to reconnect before their paths had split again. Who knew how many years would pass before their paths would cross again? But he set his sights forward, set himself to the task ahead.

Arriving in Fielbarry, Ilex took in the sights of the town and the diversity in its peoples, a small smile on his face. &quot;I haven&#39;t seen such a mixing pot of peoples in one place.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The puppy had gotten used to being in the saddle by now, and its proportionately wonky body was draped over Skena&#39;s lap like she had hunted the poor beast. Fortunately, he seemed content to occupy himself chewing on the end of the reins. 

As they reached the guild&#39;s campus, she directed her horse towards the on-sight stables, dismounting and gently pulling the dog down with her, making sure his leash was secured. 

&quot;Your horse will be well taken care of here while you&#39;re visiting,&quot; Skena offered, before pausing a moment. &quot;... Though. Could I borrow you before we part ways?&quot; She delicately placed a hand on a bundle, almost as large as she was, that was draped behind her saddle. &quot;I, um. I don&#39;t think I can carry everything in by myself. I&#39;ll manage to sort it out if you&#39;re tired and just want to go find a place to settle in, though,&quot; she added sheepishly.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In all the days of them traveling back together, it had never actually been unwrapped, and Skena had never volunteered information about what was inside, but the shape was odd and not easily recognizable. It did not, however, seem to be a dead body, despite its size, which was reassuring. 

&quot;That would be great, thank you,&quot; Skena agreed gratefully, handing her mare off to one of the stable hands to settle in and gathering up her personal belongings--which she <em>could</em> carry--and the dog&#39;s lead, starting out of the stables and towards the guild hall itself. 

&quot;If you can grant me just... maybe an hour or so to touch base with my friend and get the dog settled in, I can show you around town a little, and point you towards an inn for the night,&quot; she continued, heading inside, down the hall, and starting up the stairs. 

Stairs were hard. The puppy balked for a second, apparently confused by the obstacle, but quickly overcame this conundrum and began to... scramble-waddle up the stairs in a semi-chaotic manner. But you couldn&#39;t really blame an animal that was all legs and feet.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He couldn&#39;t help but chuckle at the puppy&#39;s graceless scramble up the stairs, following along after without complaint.

Up in the apartment, Kaleva had been winding down, having only just returned that morning from an assignment from his Order dispatching a rogue undead that had been causing trouble the next town over. He was presently napping on the couch, laying on his stomach with his head pillowed in the crook of one arm, the other dangling off the edge of the couch.

Nearly a month without Skena&#39;s presence, the place was a little less clean than it typically was. Not a mess by any means, but he had paint supplies scattered around, a couple bags of groceries that had been bought and set on the counter but not put away (Nothing that needed to be kept cool, thankfully), and stray articles of clothing and some mess from a recent kill he&#39;d made and butchered in the kitchen.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She didn&#39;t immediately swing it open, biting her lip a moment, before whispering to Ilex, &quot;Wait here just a second?&quot; And then slipping inside. 

She looked around briefly, a touch of amusement on her face at the slow devolution their apartment had experienced into a bachelor pad. But it was of little concern to her; she quickly found who she was looking for--or, rather, Gummy did. After all, it was his job to hunt down things Skena liked. 

Skena hadn&#39;t even started moving towards the couch, and Gummy was already there, having leapt up onto Kaleva&#39;s arm <em>right</em> next to his face and summoned him with a familiar, raspy croak of a meow.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

About two seconds later he jolted slightly and lifted his head, realizing he wasn&#39;t alone in the apartment. &quot;Skena?&quot; he called out, breaking off into a groggy yawn.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She sat up, unwinding herself from him, and reached to grab him by the wrists and pull him into an upright position.

She rejoined Ilex in the hall, reaching for the dog&#39;s leash and giving him another apologetic look. &quot;Sorry, just... just give me one more second,&quot; she whispered, eyeing the bundle he was carrying. &quot;--And you can put that down if you want, I really appreciate your help--&quot;

She would normally have invited him in, but... she had a feeling Kaleva wouldn&#39;t want to experience this gift around a stranger. At least not right off the bat. She awkwardly slunk back inside, now joined by the excited shuffling of doggy footsteps. The little beast had, of course, immediately seen Kaleva, and was eager to make his acquaintance.

Kaleva had grumbled out an agreement at her demanding that he not look, and stood slouched with his thumbs hooked around his belt, absently rocking on his bare feet. But it was the sudden skittering of puppy feet that had his keen ears perking and his head lifting sharply, his agreement forgotten as his eyes flew open at the sight of the puppy barreling himself into his legs.

His jaw dropped open, eyes wide, immediately dropping down to a crouch to bring his hands to the puppy&#39;s sides, his ears, his head, but the puppy&#39;s exuberance in tackling him overbalanced him, and he fell back onto his tail with a bark of laughter, immediately being assaulted by tongue and paws.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Even in just the week or two to journey back to Fielbarry, he had grown. When standing up straight, his head came up nearly to Skena&#39;s chest.

Even his head seemed proportionately too big for his body. It was undeniably cute, but... almost a little uncanny valley. 

But Kaleva knew dogs. He knew dogs very well. And once he got a good look at the dog, it would become immediately apparent that this particular dog, while almost as big as Skena, had the proportions of a puppy. Big graceless paws and all. 

Skena watched the tackling, her face lit up with a massive grin. A part of her had been... almost worried. That maybe that little spark of childlike joy was so far buried in him, even this wouldn&#39;t be able to bring it back to the surface. But the look on his face... 

Everything was, without question, worth it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Okay okay okay!&quot; he wheezed breathlessly, finally fending off the puppy enough to sit back up, wrapping arms around him and flipping him onto his back to pull him into his lap so he could rub down his belly. &quot;Are you a dog or a horse?

And as much as he&#39;d wanted a puppy since then, he&#39;d just never felt that he was in a secure enough place where it would be fair to get one, given the chance that something would happen to him, and the dog would be left on its own.

A tentative smile returned to his lips as he looked at the puppy. &quot;I... I guess this is about as stable of an environment as can be hoped for,&quot; he murmured quietly.

Kaleva, clothes dropped off, turned to see her unwrapping all the supplies, and something flickered in his expression - a subtle tension released abruptly into relief, with the echo of traumatic memories behind it.

Just... a fraction less tragedy.&quot; Clearing her throat softly, she continued. 

&quot;Well, there are two guild leaders. One is Gregor, and the other is Altaira; Altaira is drow. Usually she&#39;s more present for official matters, so I was just assuming she&#39;d be the one I&#39;d introduce you to. But... yeah, I just wanted to be sure that wouldn&#39;t send you into some sort of reaction first. Trauma is a fickle thing.&quot; Speaking of... ditching immediately post-puppy felt too... not great. She looked back towards Kaleva.

I don&#39;t imagine it&#39;ll be more than that, though.&quot;

Kaleva indeed had zero idea as to what they were talking about, but he could assume enough to not want to pry. At Skena&#39;s suggestion, he actually hesitated. It wasn&#39;t that he was loathe to being ditched, per se, but... The idea of leaving the apartment right after getting the puppy had him frozen on the spot.

But the niggling guilt of the puppy&#39;s need for exercise had him bracing himself, taking a deep breath. &quot;Yeah. Give me a moment to gear up.&quot; And he turned to head into the bedroom to don his leather armor and get his swords.

That, in turn, had Ilex shooting a slightly confused glance Kaleva&#39;s way. But he, too, didn&#39;t ask.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Kaleva pulled out a collar and leash from the supplies, fitting it around the puppy&#39;s neck - after having to pull it back because the puppy kept grabbing it in his mouth like a bit - and looked back up to Ilex then. &quot;...Think edgier.&quot; There was almost a slight tease in his voice, though that was directed with a glance toward Skena.

&quot;Edgier than a rogue?&quot; Ilex seemed to ponder that a moment. What was edgier than a rogue? His brows shot up then, connecting the dots with Kaleva&#39;s scarred-up arms. &quot;Blood Hunter.&quot;

&quot;Bingo.&quot;

&quot;Hah! Intriguing. I&#39;m a paladin myself.&quot;

Kaleva looked him over, then nodded. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;d half-guessed that. Weapon of choice?&quot;

&quot;Brutal.&quot;

With their little party secured, Skena led them back out of the apartment, down the few flights of stairs, and towards the main office. The dial beside the door was shifted to the office of Altaira, and a little knock given. Almost immediately, the door opened, revealing a drow who had just been on her way out into the hall. 

Altaira was taller than Ilex, but similarly built like the trunk of a tree. She was lightly armored, only wearing a breastplate at the moment--one of Kryn design, much like the tattoos on her face, and recognizable to any who were particularly familiar with her people--and had her hair tied in the usual low ponytail. Her eyes were... unexpected, and quietly unnerving; while Ilex would be familiar with the lightless voids of Achoris&#39; eyes, these differed in that there was a dimensional glimpse of galaxies in those lightless voids, like portals into the astral sea. Within her skull. 

She blinked expectantly at the small gaggle of individuals at her door, though her gaze landed on the one she did not recognize. At least, it did judging by the tilt of her head; where exactly she was looking was anyone&#39;s guess.

&quot;Oh! Good afternoon,&quot; Skena squeaked as the door she had been knocking on opened. &quot;Are you busy?&quot;

&quot;Good afternoon. And yes, perpetually,&quot; the drow replied in low, even tones, her voice rich in a Xhorhasian accent as her head tilted back towards Skena. &quot;What can I do for you?&quot;

&quot;Well--I actually wanted to talk to you about two things. But the first is that this is Ilex, he traveled back with me from Cusai, and was looking into employment options here with the guild. Ilex, this is Altaira... Zauviir, if I&#39;m remembering correctly?&quot;

&quot;You are.&quot; Altaira&#39;s attention landed back on Ilex. &quot;You seek to be a hunter, then?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Skena looked between the drow and her friend for a moment, before shifting slightly so her shoulder lightly touched Kaleva&#39;s side.

<em>&#39;These people are charging you far too much. Come with me, my uncle runs a pet supply store and we can get you set up.&#39;</em>

<em>The increasingly sparse back roads he was led through. The way the elf had slipped on his words, his father ran the store instead of his uncle, the way he&#39;d bristled at the confused request for clarification...</em>

<em>The anger, when before there had been only kindness. The sudden appearance of guards. Running, almost escaping, and then...</em>

<em>Mosen. The minotaur towering over him, his aura of fear soaking into his every pore, leaving him a quivering mess at his hooves, crying out to the staring crowds as he was hauled away in shackles.</em>

Kaleva&#39;s hackles had steadily raised further, all the way down the long line of his tail, which raised up steadily. Ilex was looking increasingly alarmed at the rising aggression and took a half step closer to Altaira, as though ready to shield her if need be.

Just when it seemed that Kaleva might launch himself at the drow, he said tightly through gritted teeth, &quot;Maybe some other time.&quot; And he turned with the puppy, heading straight back for the apartment, his tail lashing in sharp motions.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Once back in the apartment, as soon as Skena was inside he shut the door, dropping the leash to lock the door and make a quick circuit around the apartment, closing the shutters on the windows and latching those too.

He&#39;d never gotten the time to explain this to her, after his escape from the stadium, his exile from Cautica. Never had reason to bring it up since they reunited. His hands went to his blades, gripping the hilts firmly, the worn leather wraps granting a smidgen of security. Still, he paced. &quot;The streets got more sparsely populated. He started getting annoyed when I talked to him. I thought I was just being annoying to him. But he slipped up. Mentioned it being his father&#39;s store, not his uncle&#39;s. I started getting a bad feeling, asked for clarification, and he got... angry. I ran. Guards started coming from the buildings nearby to chase me.

&quot;You--You didn&#39;t get targeted because Cautica didn&#39;t want a tiefling in it. It was... It was me. Oberon wanted you out of my life.

Somewhere in the ramblings, inky black tears had begun to fall--from both her original eyes, as well as a few streaks from some of the eyes that had opened in various places on her face that eyes did not belong. She looked up at Kaleva, her mutated features twisted in heartache. 

&quot;All the corruption, and his hands were thoroughly stained in it. And I brought you right into the path of his hatred. I told you it was <em>safe</em> there...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;... I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she whimpered, taking a few steps away from him. &quot;I... I did this to Achoris, too. I&#39;m sorry. He... He said... He said maybe I had made myself fall.

So I could get out.&quot; She was quiet a moment, eyes continuing to blink open and closed over her skin, some leaking inky tears and making her look like she was melting again. 

She shook her head a little. &quot;... I don&#39;t think I did it. I... I think Anubis did. I think He felled me because me having a halo was trapping me somewhere where I had no reason to want to live. Achoris didn&#39;t think it sounded like Anubis actually disapproved of me at all. I...

The eyes remained in their unnatural quantity, though gradually, more were closing than new ones were opening. And as she spoke, the gold began to slowly return as well, giving each eye a discernible pupil. Which was arguably worse to look at.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Settling down on the floor, she pulled open the silk pouch and dumped three knuckle bones into her palm. &quot;And its okay, Kaleva. Really. It&#39;s... It&#39;s understandable.&quot; She offered him a sympathetic smile, rolling the bones in her hand a moment, then nodded to the floor in front of her to beckon him to sit, too.

&quot;So this is limited, but the answers are always spot on. I can ask about something that&#39;s going to happen within the next couple of days or so, and His response will be <em>weal</em> or <em>woe</em>. Which is effectively answering in the positive, in the negative--or, in some complicated cases, answering a little bit of both.&quot; She took one bone and placed it on the rug between them. 

&quot;If two of the three bones are lying flat, like this, its an answer in the positive, or <em>weal</em>.&quot; She then shifted the bone sideways. &quot;If two of the three bones are laying on their sides, like this, the answer is in the negative, or <em>woe</em>. If all three of the bones are in the same position, it&#39;s a complicated answer that contains both <em>weal</em> and <em>woe</em>. So I think I&#39;ll ask... if Kaleva would regret going with Altaira today. Which means two bones on their side will translate to: <em>no, you will not regret it</em>. In other words, everything is fine. Any other answer, and we don&#39;t go. Okay?&quot; She explained gently, offering him a little smile.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Taking a deep breath, her fingers closed over the bones. Not that it particularly obscured them, as her skin rapidly began to lose opacity, turning her over a few seconds into a glassy shell housing a skeleton. &quot;We want to know if Kaleva would regret going with Altaira tomorrow,&quot; she murmured softly, rolling the bones briefly in her hand before letting them fall onto the floor. As they fell, each bone seemed to become a little orb of golden light, though upon landing, that light gradually ebbed away again, at the same time that Skena&#39;s complexion started to shift back to normal. As the light faded, the position of the bones became visible: one flat, two on their sides.

Skena leaned forward slightly to look over them, her gentle smile remaining. Glancing up, she cast Kaleva that reassuring smile, before softly, almost secretively murmuring, &quot;Touch them.&quot;

If he did so, he would find each of the bones gently warm to the touch, in a way that would have been impossible to have come from Skena&#39;s own body heat.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She blinked. “Speaking of which. I actually learned a lot from Achoris. It’s more complicated than him just being a cannibal. He thinks human meat is to him as sugar is to me, and that our needs for those food types are part of who we are racially. He had been… trapped for a time by a drow woman, deprived of the food he was intended to eat, and the way he described it was miserable. He had to have Ilex sacrifice two of his fingers for him to regain enough strength to help them all get free. I don’t think he’s a psychopath, he just. Can’t control what his body needs, and has chosen to not harbor guilt about what he can’t control.”

She paused, before reaching out to stick a finger in the bowl of powdered sugar, popping it into her mouth. “… But it makes sense to me.

He set down his knife so he could try to get all his questions sorted in his head. &quot;Okay, first off - breasts having nothing to do with sex? I thought they did, because... Well, Anya really liked having hers played with when we were fooling around. She definitely got sexual gratification out of having them touched.

Well... I mean...&quot; Her own features were starting to look a little bruised, but by god she was making a valiant effort to hang in there. For science. 

&quot;Breasts aren&#39;t equipped with nerves the way genitals are. Genitals are far more sensitive. And I&#39;ve never heard of any cases where an orgasm could be reached solely via stimulation to a woman&#39;s breasts--though. Granted, that... that kind of bodily science is not where my expertise is. Still, it&#39;s... we&#39;re not hardwired for that to be a thing, even if there <em>are</em> outlier cases I don&#39;t know about. But breasts are still <em>sensitive</em>, not unlike... like the way the soles of your feet are sensitive. It feels good to massage your feet, and... I imagine if that was socially normalized as a sexual thing, you could add an intimate mindset to the activity and effectively be deriving sexual pleasure from it. But that doesn&#39;t mean inherently sensitive parts of your body like that are, by design, sexual. Breasts are sensitive for other reasons, too.&quot; She paused to take a bite of elvish toast, her breath gently puffing up a tiny cloud of powdered sugar. 

&quot;This is true for any mammal,&quot; she continued through her mouthful, before swallowing and carrying on, &quot;But it&#39;s the act of nursing that releases the mother&#39;s milk. We have some muscles in our bodies that, by default, are flexed closed. The most relatable example would be in our urinary tracts. We have to voluntarily release those muscles--which is usually referred to as &#39;let-down reflexes&#39;. A woman&#39;s nipples have this as well, except it&#39;s less of something that the mother can voluntarily will herself to release. It&#39;s the infant&#39;s suckling that stimulates the nerves there, which releases both prolactin and oxytocin into the mother&#39;s bloodstream. The prolactin spurs along the production of the milk itself, sort of made-to-order style, while the oxytocin is what triggers the breast to release the milk through that let-down reflex. But oxytocin is also a chemical our bodies release when we feel things like love. It&#39;s a feel-good chemical. That&#39;s why breastfeeding, in any mammal, is a bonding experience between mother and offspring, provided there are no interfering conditions to hinder that bonding, such as the mother being a sociopath. But when operating as intended, it&#39;s an experience that allows the mother to strengthen her bond with her offspring, because it quite literally gives her the feeling of being in love. If you take the mother-offspring dynamic out of it, oxytocin still is responsible for creating feelings of affection. So stimulating breasts for intimacy&#39;s sake would similarly feel good, or release oxytocin in a way that would feel additive to the intimacy.&quot;

She partially hid her mouth behind the corner of toast, pausing as she realized how much she had talked. &quot;... In theory.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Another pause, and then he shifted gears. &quot;So I admittedly know very little about the other gods of Cusai. Names mostly, and some of them I know a little about what they represent.

She paused a moment, before gently clearing her throat. &quot;One of Set&#39;s offspring is Sobek. He&#39;s the one depicted with the head of a crocodile. Set&#39;s other child is. Um. Anubis.&quot;

He cleared his throat slightly, then continued. &quot;My dad had illusion magic that he could disguise himself as a human. He hooked up with my mom, she got pregnant, and he panicked. She didn&#39;t know what he was, and she was from a small village of highly superstitious people. She was sixteen. He bailed for fear of the repercussions that would come his way.

He didn&#39;t have magic like my father did, but he had an amulet that let him disguise himself as a human. He was always so careful about it. My best guess is someone actually found his cabin, saw us as we really are, and reported our location to people who made it a profession to hunt down and exterminate tieflings. As far as I know, he had no idea that anyone knew where we lived until they attacked one night. Killed all the dogs, set the cabin on fire with us still in it.&quot;

He pursed his lips slightly, eyes narrowed. &quot;Marko was a realist and a pessimist. He was always prepared. You had to be, to survive where we lived. He had an emergency bag packed with everything we&#39;d need to survive. Shoved it in my arms and told me to run. Told me he&#39;d find me after all this &#39;nonsense&#39; was done, then went to confront them. I kept hidden, stayed on the run for about a week before I circled back. They&#39;d left his body there, but they took his horns as a trophy. So I salvaged what I could and left.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;... What if you could talk to him anyways?&quot; She asked after a long pause, her gaze unfocused as she seemed to be thinking. After a moment, she looked back to Kaleva.

&quot;I--I don&#39;t know how to do it right now. But... I know of so many adjacent types of magic. It could very well be possible for me to commune with his spirit.

Animals are free of sin; they all go to the blessed afterlife.&quot; She set her plate down on the counter, having eaten about half of the elvish toast--which was a lot for her. 

&quot;I wish I could properly describe some of my dreams to you. I hope the afterlife is like those places. Just... a giant starscape above in a pitch black sky, more stars than I&#39;ve ever seen before. All subtly shifting and moving. Vast expanses of sand below, and the air is just the right temperature; warm, like the desert, but like <em>nights</em> in the desert, with a gentle breeze that keeps it from ever being too hot. And just... the faint smell of the river, the fleeting scent of spices... and it... it always feels so safe. That... That caution in the back of your mind when you&#39;re outside in the wilderness at night--it&#39;s not there. There&#39;s not this threat that you could step on something venomous, or run into an animal that wants to kill you. It all... It feels as cozy and welcoming and safe as my own bed. But it&#39;s vast and starry and... it just fills my chest with this resonating awe and tranquility and surreal... timelessness. And He doesn&#39;t always speak to me with words, but when He does, His voice is deep and rich and it rumbles a little and feels like an embrace. It&#39;s the kind of voice that could tell you anything and you would believe it without question. The kind of voice that could be a lullaby regardless of the words themselves. He always speaks so kindly and... gentle. I can&#39;t even begin to imagine Him in a state of anger, frustration, irritation... He has that same timeless tranquility as the land He brings me to. Even when I had been cast out, when He brought me there that night, it was just... just so much peace. Peace I wasn&#39;t sure I deserved.&quot; She rubbed her arm a little, her gaze somewhere far away.

&quot;... Part of what&#39;s eaten at me like acid all this time has been wondering if I disappointed a god like that. If I had fallen short of continuing to earn the embrace of His voice. Not knowing for sure is the only way I think I&#39;ve stayed sane. If I... If I knew for sure that He was disappointed in me, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do. I don&#39;t know if I could handle it. How do you tolerate yourself if you managed to upset the most peaceful thing in existence?&quot;

She shook her head a little, her gaze slowly making its way back to Kaleva. After a moment, she gave him a small smile. &quot;I want us both to have really nice, ripe, full lives. But when we make that final journey, I can&#39;t wait to see it with you.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Something they could hang up in the living room of the cabin, once he finished building it, perhaps.

&quot;I honestly don&#39;t see that He&#39;d be disappointed in you. Which lends support to the idea that He took your halo to help you escape from a bad situation... And makes me wonder if He gave you something else in return. All those extra eyes that popped up?

&quot;But yeah. I want the same thing. It&#39;s nice to think that at the end of it all we&#39;ll have a safe place to rest.&quot; Looking down at the stew and pushing around a hunk of meat, his lips pursed briefly for a moment. &quot;...I just hope the scales weigh in my favor.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Still, the apartment was a bit too small for two large canines to be having unanimous zoomies, and she was a bit too small to be anywhere near such activity without risk of being trampled.

“Kaleva!” She yelled after them again, her words whining but her tone betraying a degree of lightheartedness. “Either establish yourself as dominant or whatever or I’ll gonna take a spray bottle to both of you!”

Finally, everything was quiet for the span of several long seconds, Kaleva&#39;s tail held high as he lifted his head and gazed regally down at the puppy, oversized ears forward.

That way we can easily come right back into town in a safe location if we need to run errands or check the notice board or something. But people wouldn&#39;t be able to stumble across it and use it because both ends would be inside our property under lock and key.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Like… think like a stall, but adjoined to the home itself and sharing sometimes multiple common walls. Basically another room in the house, just one that also opens to the outside enough for large beasts to move through. We could do a fancier version of that, having effectively indoor spaces in a segment of the home, but with things like low partitions instead of whole walls adjoining the stall to our home to make it feel like <em>part</em> of the living space, instead of like… making it feel like he’s an outdoor pet. So he would have areas he is and is not allowed in, but the spaces he is allowed in would be easily accessible from the outside while still sharing the benefits of being indoors the same as if he was a smaller pet. Does that make sense? We’d also be able to access <em>him</em> much more easily that way, too. I don’t want either of you having to feel like he’s basically a horse that doesn’t come inside and do cozy pet things with you.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>
