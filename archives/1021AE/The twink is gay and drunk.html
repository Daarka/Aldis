Or, for some people, stumbling home absolutely shitfaced from too much whiskey. 

The good news was that at least Nikotiemus wasn&#39;t going to go completely broke on Arseni&#39;s bar tab, because even though the tiefling was not a lightweight by any stretch, he was also a pretty small little shit. The bad news was that the feral hell cat Nikotiemus had adopted for his own amusement was once again back under their shared roof.

Arseni shuffle-stumbled through the door, barely managing to close it behind him as he blinked hard a few times, looking around. As if he had forgotten why he entered the building, and was trying to remember. His usual resting bitch face was in reliable attendance, though in his intoxication, his pupils were a bit more dilated than normal. 

He drank often, but not usually to the point of stumbling and disorientation. Though as far as what made tonight a special exception, who could say.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was dressed casually tonight, which for him meant socks, pressed slacks, and a button-down shirt with the cuffs turned up to the elbows, open to his collarbone. His spider silk hair was gathered into a loose tail behind him, wrapped in a pale blue ribbon.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He seemed to get his body snagged on the door frame into the room Nikotiemus was playing in, and consequentially came to a halt, shifting his shoulder against the wall slightly so he was less collided into it and more leaning on it. You know, intentionally.

Apart from his resting bitch face--which, really, was his baseline neutral expression, despite how it looked--he was somewhat hard to read at the moment, more seeming zoned out than actually occupied by thoughts or emotions. Though Nikotiemus&#39; eye was keen, and just a glance in his direction would have him notice that the tiefling&#39;s tail, normally held low but aloft behind him, was completely limp and dragging on the floor.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There was more silence. More awkward, blank staring. Then Arseni pushed himself off the door frame and shuffled closer, ambling to a halt a little more than an arm&#39;s reach away from the changeling. As he came closer, Nikotiemus would easily notice that he didn&#39;t just smell like a night at the tavern. He also smelled strongly of smoke and charcoal, and there were soot stains all over his clothes. 

His gaze wandered the room a moment, not seeming to really see anything, though--however, that &quot;neutral&quot; expression soured into a proper frown as he seemed to work through whatever was going on inside his head. It wouldn&#39;t take the most insightful person to gather that the answer to Nikotiemus&#39; question was <em>not</em> that he had a good night.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He shuffled along as he was herded towards the bathroom, grumbling incoherently in the back of his throat.

While Arseni had been given free reign to decorate his rooms as he liked, the tub and the vanity had been selected by Nikotiemus. The clawfoot tub was black porcelain, with the feet and the knobs, faucet, and detachable shower head done in gold. The vanity matched it, with a marble countertop, black with gold veins, and a large mirror. He turned Arseni around once they were in the bathroom, and signed to him with a quirked brow. <em>&#39;What did you burn up this time?&#39;</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Too bad Arseni didn&#39;t seem to be actively seeing any of it. His glazed over eyes landed on the signing, and after a small delay, there was a colorful journey of little micro-expressions on his soot-stained face. All of them were variants of negativity. Finally settling on a decidedly dark scowl, he sloppily began to sign back, though he faltered almost immediately. &quot;My&quot; was definitely the first word, but he seemed to abandon course a short way into the first gesture for the second word. It was possible, based on the beginning of the movement, however, that it was something in the realm of the signed word for &quot;father&quot;. 

But the word didn&#39;t get completed, because he seemed to finally realize Nikotiemus was holding his tail like an ass leash. <em>Extra</em>-frowning, he gave it a graceless lash to whip it free again, though--unless the changeling was deciding to grip onto it--it only flopped back down to the floor lifelessly once more.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He swayed on his feet a little more... and then abruptly jolted forward, snagging a fistful of Nikotiemus&#39; collar in his fist and half-shoving, half-falling on him to topple him back onto the floor.

And much like the topography of his skin, his mouth was also a spiky and inhospitable place, filled with nothing but pointy teeth and a forked tongue--though at least that tongue was something fun.

Arseni wasn&#39;t much of a romantic, however. They had barely been locking lips for a solid moment in time before he was clumsily shifting his body weight until he was straddling Nikotiemus&#39; waist--and his tail finally seemed to remember its own existence. Niko had poked and prodded at the appendage before, was somewhat familiar with the narrow, blade-like edges of its diamond-shaped tip, but he&#39;d never actually seen it used as anything other than an expressive part of Arseni&#39;s anatomy that was wont to betray his emotions, and occasionally an additional limb with which to grab things or generally cause annoyances. But the sharpness of that tip, that had never served any real purpose.

Now, however, it suddenly moved with a much more direct intent--albeit, not as deft as it might have been if the body it was attached to had been sober. That diamond-shaped tip slipped into the waistband of Nikotiemus&#39; slacks, at first with the flat side flush against his body--but then twisting to carve that bladed edge into his clothes, the wiry muscle of the appendage flexing to draw that sharp tip straight down the front of one of his pant legs with a sudden tearing sound. The goal didn&#39;t seem to be to wound Nikotiemus... but Arseni was sloppy drunk and most likely gave the changeling a few good, shallow scrapes in the process.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But he didn&#39;t seem opposed to the disrobing, his hands moving to start pulling at Arseni&#39;s clothing in return. Less destructive with the garments, but nearly as impatient, drawing pearlescent nails against the scaly crimson skin of Arseni&#39;s chest and sides.

His pants were irredeemably marred, the once neatly pressed gray slacks falling open on one leg to expose that too-pale skin, scored with pink lines where Arseni&#39;s tail had nicked him in its clumsiness, smooth and hairless and soft as silk.

As his tail stretched out behind him in this endeavor, it then collapsed downwards to lie flush against the changeling’s leg, slithering back up the way it had come to settle in and constrict about the crevices of his body’s shape. 

Arseni’s other end, meanwhile, was also busy. The claw still clenched in Niko’s shirt flexed, and then ripped downwards, several buttons popping as the shirt was destructively modified to expose more of his chest—and not unlike with his tail, this probably got Nikotiemus once again scraped in the process, as Arseni’s hands were rough, scaled in some places, spiked in others, and practically designed to passively scratch things they came in contact with.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Arseni&#39;s scratches were like painting pink lines on a canvas, the only splashes of color to be found on his otherwise smooth, hairless, and unmarked skin.

Nikotiemus was very quickly beginning to realize that sex with Arseni was going to be like having sex with sandpaper. Everything was going to chafe. Badly. Lubricants were going to be needed. With sudden, startling clarity, Niko knew that on this particular romp, if he couldn&#39;t convince Arseni to let him up to grab some, there was no way in hell he was going to be bottoming. He hadn&#39;t seen what the tiefling was packing yet, but he was absolutely convinced it would be like fucking a cheese grater, and Nikotiemus wasn&#39;t about to have his bowels scraped raw like that.

With a slight growl, Niko yanked Arseni&#39;s shirt up over his head, catching and tearing it on his horns on the way off and not feeling the slightest bit bad about it, given the sad fate of his own clothing. He then reached out to grab Arseni&#39;s hips to try to anchor him in place, and ground his groin up between the apex of his thighs with firm, deliberate motions.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

None of this was in any way communicated to Nikotiemus, of course. Instead, Arseni snarled at the shirt as it roughly was forced past his head and horns, as if the article of clothing was personally offending him by way of it having momentarily blinded him. The hand that had been clenched in Niko&#39;s hair finally released him, moving instead to clumsily claw at the fastenings of his own pants. It took a few seconds longer than it should have, but eventually enough pieces were loosened or torn, and his pants were crudely pushed down some.

With a fresh snarl, partly from pain but mostly from something closer to bloodlust, the tiefling&#39;s tail slithered into action again to find, grip, and then <em>constrict</em> around Nikotiemus&#39; manhood, effectively goading him on in return. His claws found a new home on either side of Niko&#39;s ribs, sinking in and drawing small red lines into his stark flesh.

His kisses were sharp and punishing, his tongue lapping up the coppery taste of blood, while two lubed fingers delved beneath Arseni&#39;s tail to find his taint and tried to press in, not particularly caring to be careful with the claws.

And Arseni didn&#39;t seem to mind at all; if anything, his natural anatomy seemed well suited for the rough treatment. It did, unfortunately, seem to excite him to the point that his own handling of Nikotiemus was certainly not getting any gentler. But such was the nature of fucking an uppity barbarian. The violence tended to snowball.

With a deep groan, rattling in a pervasive growl stirred from the center of his chest, Arseni&#39;s head twisted to sink his teeth into Nikotiemus&#39; shoulder, instantly drawing blood in the world&#39;s worst hickey. Simultaneously, his hips ground down into the now oiled surface of Niko&#39;s body, his own member almost burning hot against the changeling&#39;s abdomen. And, as it turned out, it wasn&#39;t quite as terrifyingly spiky as the rest of him; instead, it was <em>mostly</em> humanoid, as was typical for tieflings, though that draconic heritage that was responsible for the more bestial, rough, scaly features on the rest of him seemed to have slight influence on his crotch as well. Mainly in that he, similar to Nikotiemus, did not really have much body hair to speak of--but whereas that left Niko silky smooth, for Arseni, hair was simply substituted for coarse scales and spiky bumps. At least there weren&#39;t any easily noticeable scales or spikes on his cock itself... but there <em>were</em> a number of piercings to rival those on his face. These were in the form of about a half dozen bars in a ladder up the underside of his shaft, ending in a perpendicular ring through the bottom of the head. All the same warm brass color as the rest of his more easily viewed piercings. 

Needless to say, some claws in his ass was not a sort of pain he was going to shy from. In fact, he ground down into the touch.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His fingers delved deep into Arseni&#39;s ass, pushing their way inside and scissoring him open, stretching him in preparation while his breath came short and heavy, noises the likes of which he never normally made now freely torn from his vocal chords. He ground his hips up, trying to rub alongside Arseni&#39;s own length even while his was trapped by his tail, and that soundless voice in the tiefling&#39;s head snarled, <em>&#39;Are you going to fuck me or not?!&#39;</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He <em>was</em>, however, distantly aware of the disembodied, soundless voice in his head and its familiar origin. With his teeth still latched onto his shoulder and the growl still rumbling heavily from his core, he shifted his weight ever so slightly, his tail&#39;s grip on Niko&#39;s member adjusting to guide it into his own body, the appendage then unraveling from his shaft to make room as Arseni roughly ground down to meet their hips flush together. 

Perhaps unsurprisingly, his inner body temperature was even hotter than it was externally. Still not quite intolerable burning, but... close.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His hands planted on either of Niko&#39;s pecs, claws sinking in there too, because apparently that was the only way he knew how to grab anything, and he used that position to prop his torso up on his arms, allowing him a bit more freedom to settle into a proper rhythm against his partner.

It had a way of just... taking all edge off of anything that would have been intimidating, and making him look like the dumb baby he was.

His hands slid around behind Arseni&#39;s back and dragged his newly-formed claws down his skin, pressing in hard enough to put that draconic hide to the test, all the while rocking his hips to keep with the rhythm of the tiefling&#39;s movements.

Whatever full feeling Arseni might feel from having the changeling&#39;s cock buried balls-deep inside of him would gradually begin to grow, bit by bit. As if his shaft were getting longer, girthier, by fractions every few seconds. And were those... ridges? They would certainly feel like ridges.

Nikotiemus&#39; impromptu claws would find that Arseni&#39;s back was probably some of the thickest, roughest hide on his body. A small ridge of larger scales followed the line of his spine, even a few spiky bits rising up between his shoulder blades (though nothing large enough to make normal shirts problematic). Even with Niko being rough, he almost certainly would not be using ample force on his first attempt to draw blood; it was like trying to scratch open a crocodile. 

Unfortunately, Arseni was a bit too drunk to fully grasp the treasure that was a cock-changing fuckbuddy. As far as he knew, Nikotiemus had always been shaped like this and he just forgot somewhere in the last minute or two. A lot was happening. He only had room for one, <em>maybe</em> two thoughts at a time right now. Memories? Object permanence? Nope.

But that didn&#39;t mean it didn&#39;t feel <em>great</em>. With a shuddering moan, he curled forward a bit, involuntarily dragging his claws down Niko&#39;s chest as he reflexively buckled slightly to the sensations.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was certainly... unique to be jerking off a cock with that much jewelry in it, but intriguing in its own right, depending on one&#39;s personal tastes.

At the telepathic command, another shudder ran up Arseni&#39;s spine, his grinding movements against the changeling sacrificing what little coordination they had in favor of feverish friction. The hand that was still on Niko&#39;s chest was carving lines deeper and deeper into the tissue there, and even his tail, where it was strangling Nikotiemus&#39; thigh, was also carving in deeper at its tip.

It didn&#39;t take too terribly long before he hit the peak he was pushing for, crying out roughly as he came into Niko&#39;s hand--and <em>that</em> temperature <em>was</em> burning. Not unlike an unfortunate splash of water whilst cooking pasta, Niko&#39;s hand and midriff would suddenly be stung with a jolt of too-hot fluid as Arseni abandoned his rhythmic grinding, his muscles flexed rigidly and body constricted around Nikotiemus. But he didn&#39;t seem to hit any sort of sensory overload, seemingly not objecting to Nikotiemus doing whatever else he needed to do to meet his own needs while he rode out the aftershocks of his orgasm.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He shuddered, his shaft flexing within him as he shot his load deep inside him, lost in the ecstacy and slowly coming back down from his peak.

He slumped practically bonelessly back onto the tile, panting heavily, covered in sweat and blood and semen and lube. Gods, he needed a bath.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Minutes dragged by as they both panted, their breathing eventually evening out to more normal paces.

Well, he was beaten up quite a bit more severely than Arseni was, so he cast cure wounds upon himself until all his hurts had faded away, and then, grumbling, pushed Arseni off of himself so he could get up off the uncomfortable floor.

Part of him considered leaving him there, but... He squinted, faintly, recalling the tiefling&#39;s behavior prior to their tryst. With a grunt, he leaned down to haul Arseni up off the floor, carrying him to his bed and setting him down on the sheets. Even tucked him in for good measure, and left him some painkillers and a glass of water on the night stand next to his table.

Conscience satisfied, he went off to his own bathroom, and after a long bath that he almost fell asleep in himself, he bundled himself up in a robe and curled up in his own four-poster bed, completely composed and put together (and all his altered proportions back to his usual norm) and no longer looking as though he had gotten into an argument with a lawnmower.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He slept long and hard, finally properly waking up well into the late morning. After a great deal of groggy rolling around, he pushed his extremely dirty body up--and immediately felt the aches and pains from several scratches, bites, and of course, a giant monster cock in his ass. But this was taken in stride after a moment to adjust; it was far from the first time he had woke up in such a condition. 

Rolling out of bed, and with his head throbbing in protest, he ambled into a bath like a zombie, halfassedly washing himself up so he at least didn&#39;t have dried cum on himself. The first pair of pants he touched were what he put on, and he continued his shuffling forward motion out into the kitchen, having either not seen or completely ignored the bedside offering. Even his mohawk was flat and slightly tussled with his version of wicked bedhead--which, granted, wasn&#39;t that terrible, since the hairs were basically just coarse bristles that were not easily tangled up in themselves.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, August 20, 2021 1:47 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He fell completely still, his expression darkening. Not in the petulant, annoying way in which he usually got angry. No, this new look on his face made his usual frowning and scowling look like it was all meant in jest. He almost gave the impression he was about to put Niko&#39;s lights out with the daggers he was glaring into him... but after a few seconds, he simply turned back towards his food. That fury remained like electricity in the air around him, but it wasn&#39;t his usual fiery outburst of rage. It was <em>frigid</em>.

Into the next room he went, and not long after, the sound of the grand piano began to fill the house.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Niko would be well into the song, perhaps even into a second song, before Arseni shuffled in. He still looked closed off, but that deeply hateful look wasn’t quite present anymore, though he still seemed in a pretty sour mood. He also looked… a little tired. In an existential way. 

He didn’t actually look at Nikotiemus upon entering. He just mindlessly shuffled over, and unceremoniously buckled down to sit facing the opposite direction as the changeling on the floor, with his back up against the piano bench and his horns propped back on the seat.

Niko was deaf, of course, but his intrinsic connection to vibrations would easily betray something that was more vibration than it was sound: originating from the tiefling’s chest was a subtle (but undeniable) continuous rumbling, which became impossible to miss the longer Nikotiemus went about massaging his head.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
