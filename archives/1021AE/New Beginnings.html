As evening fell, warm rays of the sunset fell softly through the windows, lighting the room in a dying, rosy glow. Wall sconces burned with enchanted fire, producing no heat and needing no fuel source, to keep the room lit as the sun began to disappear behind far mountains on the horizon, and the hearth--surrounded by cozy seating aplenty--had been lit... and also seemed to magically manage itself consistently. A few trophies, presumably from hunts passed, decorated that pleasant corner, ruled over by the skull of some sort of massive feline that looked out from over the fireplace.

A small pit dipped into the floor a stone&#39;s throw away from the more typical seating around the hearth, lined in a soft, ornate rug, and decorated with a large assortment of sizable pillows, creating even more wonderfully inviting seating for anyone whose anatomy made standard seating difficult--or who simply wanted to sit in such a space.

With several dining tables in the opposite corner, and a sort of breakfast nook opposite the cozy hearth, there was no shortage of seating--nor dining surfaces. And yet more had been added for the purpose of the gathering, including a large buffet table stocked with delicious looking food; chicken breasts, cooked to a savory gold color, a large ham, already sliced and ready to be portioned out, a few salad bowls with different assortments of contents between them (but all offering strictly vegetarian choices), and a variety of other side dishes, such as bread rolls, purple potatoes cooked in a hint of balsamic vinegar, lemon-pepper seasoned steamed broccoli, and the like. Also set out were several wine bottles (all the same label), a pitcher of chilled milk, a larger pitcher of ice water, and a final pitcher of chilled orange juice, as well as enough wine glasses, regular drinking glasses, dishes and silverware to accommodate about two dozen mouths.

And, of course, the crown jewel of the guild commons: the far wall flanking all the picturesque seating, with an ever-flowing, burbling fountain of clear water that split into two streams, both serving to irrigate lush and colorful gardens that ran the length of the entire wall. At its center, an intricate piano affixed with a complex construction of elegant pipework--though it had been transformed some since residents had last seen it. From an upright piano, with its back to the wall, it had apparently had its upright back folded out and repositioned to an arrangement more akin to a grand piano. The pipes, which usually channeled water from the flowing stream behind it, had--with the shift of a hidden lever--been severed from the water&#39;s flow, the instrument no longer playing itself. The final change to the room&#39;s centerpiece was that the piano itself had been pivoted forty-five degrees, and a bench placed in front of the keys--allowing it to be played by someone who could have the rest of the room in their peripherals whilst playing.

Any hunters who had wandered through earlier to the start of the event may have even seen a familiar drow scooting the piano around by hand with practiced ease. As if it weighed the same as a basket of laundry. 

But time had passed since then, and the same drow was now standing near the buffet table--though not partaking in the presented food quite yet. She was dressed elegantly, but not too extravagantly, wearing a silver-trimmed tunic with long, draping sleeves, sharp shoulder lines, and a delicate filigree of what might have been actual metal silver across the fabric--the fabric itself being a dusky grey with the faintest hints of a purple hue. Her hair was in its usual low ponytail, no makeup on her face, either, but she still cut an intimidating and well-put-together figure.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-863225949922394112 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=863225949922394112><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, July 09, 2021 6:11 PM">6:11 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>And that figure was currently tilting its head towards the equally large man beside her; early arrivals would likely hear a soft conversation, where her even, deep tones were patiently trying to explain, &quot;--Semi-formal is not <em>armor</em>, and you know this.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The changeling was dressed as he usually was: impeccably. A ruffled dove gray button down shirt and slacks, a pale blue vest with silver embellishments, shiny black leather shoes, and a victorian-style frock coat in the same wintry blue as his vest. His long, wispy white hair was gathered in a loose ponytail at his nape, and atop his head sat a pale blue top hat with a wide silver band.

After the drow had arranged the piano in place, Nikotiemus had sat right down and begun to play, his long, spidery fingers dancing across the keys to provide songs appropriate to the atmosphere.

He stood equally tall, but was about twice as broad, with arms like tree trunks and a barrel chest that stretched the leather jerkin he was wearing to its limit.  A fur lined half cape hung from his shoulders, and a series of worn leather belts wrapped around his waist.  

In start contrast to the rest of his outfit, which seemed practical and battle ready, a crumpled old top hat sat atop his medium length black hair.  The hat had seen better days; a large patch of green fabric was stitched into the side, and the upper seam was busted, causing the top to flop forward in a comical fashion.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-863229968422141953 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=863229968422141953><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, July 09, 2021 6:27 PM">6:27 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Besides, how can you get on my case when <em>you&#39;re</em> not even wearing a <em>hat!</em>&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her chestnut brown hair was pinned at the side, though equally soft curls kept it from being entirely maintained. It bobbed just at her cheeks, frizzed a little in the back and looked wholly unbefitting of the cautious frown she wore. 
Her dress was an attempt at formal, though clearly worn. The pinstripe slacks were largely silver and grey, with hints of black that had not faded out. Her top was a simple cream blouse with scalloped sleeves, silver suspenders criss-crossed at her back and holding over her shoulders. Around her wrist was a faded yellow cord adorned by copper bells, dented and about the size of blueberries. 

Her leather boots were like her trousers, oversized and faded. Painted on the tongue of each was a chrysanthemum, one pastel blue and the other pastel green. Being worn but oiled, there was little sound as she stepped towards the buffet carefully, each step measured as she tried to learn her way around the grounds.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

For those that had seen the large gecko-man slinking around town before, his outfit today was perhaps shocking. He wore a fairly well-kept jacket - albeit with several patches of different colours adorning it - actual trousers - cut off at the knee - and one incredibly high quality boot on his right foot. The boot, unfortunately, had to be modified to fit his non-human feet, and as such the sole had been removed, relegating the boot to be little more than a leather shin guard. Underneath the jacket he still wore some bone jewellery, adorned with a few blue and red feathers as well.

After arriving, he slinked over to the piano, preferring to sit nearby where he could listen to the music and observe the room and its occupants.
-----
Vale arrived sometime after this, and happily seated himself near the hearth where he kept himself entertained with reading a small book, content to keep to himself while he waited for more people to arrive. His hair was braided in the same  way as always, but with a few streaks of golden fabric worked into the braid itself.  His outfit was a departure from the norm as well, instead featuring well-fitted trousers, shirt and a jacket, along with black leather shoes to round out the suit and make him look like a half respectable gentleman.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

If not for their differing clothing and hair, one might have assumed it was a single tiefling with a duplicate. They each had blue-grey skin and striking yellow eyes, along with wavy seafoam green hair. Their horns swept up in an outward curve before dipping in toward the middle, similar to a bull’s, but shiny and smooth. 

One, with shorter, not quite shoulder length hair, wore an outfit akin to that of a jester, alternating rows of white and deep blue diamonds along the top, which had a silky white cravat and white sleeves that puffed before sitting close to the arms again three times. Their almost skin-tight pants were a matching deep blue down one leg, and a chessboard diamonds down the other, ending in shoes that curled upward at the toe. Sitting atop their head was a jesters hat in that same blue, tiny bells dangling from the end of each tendril. 

The other twin had longer hair kept in two thin braids, and chopped, wavy bangs. They wore slim fitting, high waisted black slacks and a creamy colored blouse that was tucked at the waist with ruffles running vertically on either side of the buttons and at the ends of the sleeves, which were billowy around their arms and cinched at the wrist. On their feet, a simpler pair of smart leather boots, matching the belt around their natural waist. A wide-brimmed green velvet hat with a massive white feather sat askew atop their head, and they flashed a sharp-toothed grin around the gathering as they slipped in. 

The more costumed of the pair signed something to the other, who murmured something in response, and then they headed together to the buffet tables, apparently enticed by the spread. 

The more formal of the pair would give a polite nod if the two leaders looked their direction, but otherwise, it seemed the two were intent on filling a plate.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He seemed a touch timid seeing all the others gathering, or perhaps simply overwhelmed, but not so much as to avoid the party all together. Just enough to quietly make his way in after the others cleared from the entrance way. 

The tiefling was shade of dark grey, with hints of purple shade. His eyes glew a lovely shade of purple as well, the same color seemed to be mirrored in core of his horns, however this gemstone like color did not glow. His robes were semi-formal at worst. Layers of colored fabrics. Violets, Blues, and wine colors, offset with bronze rings and clasps. A few gold and silver rings pierced his brow and ears, while a few bands of gold lay on his horns, with small chains left to dangle. 

Once inside, he scanned the room for something of interest, particularly food. He would quickly make his way over before looking at the ham, pausing and then looking to the Guild Heads and offered a polite smile.</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=jack_o_lantern><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=🎃 src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/twitter/twemoji@latest/assets/svg/1f383.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>3</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

Slightly startled by the amount of people in the commons, and especially by how well dressed and how much he was not getting all the codes of what &quot;semi formal&quot; meant, he quickly regained composure to, at least, seem semi formal himself. Whatever that could mean.

Among all the other well dressed up members, he&#39;d stand out a bit with his basic beige shirt with the sleeves rolled up, belted high on his abdomen by a braided rope belt buckled by a little metal piece looking like a little shield.
On his shoulders was something that looked like a green semi-cape, only covering the upper part of his torso, something that could have totally been cut from a carpet if not for the almost golden patterns embroidered in the fabric, matching his golden earings and curious bracelet on his right arm, the only elements that could make you think he&#39;s not actually a thug who just infiltrated the place.
Looking further down his body would not bring up more distinguished clothes as he was wearing simple leather pants and boots.

The composure he briefly tried to maintain quickly disappeared at the sight of the buffet, exposing before him what he always thought be fitting for a king, without any royal guard to prevent curious hand from taking what&#39;s not theirs.
He kept a steady pace towards the table filled with goods, then gravitating around it, waiting for the moment where it would be adequate to just ravish the buffet.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The source of the bells seemed to be her feet, bare save for anklets with pleasant chimes for each step she took. Her shirt was barely that, moreso a bra than anything else. She&#39;d unstitched her shirt sleeves, leaving just the top to cover what little modesty she had. Draping over her shoulders was a well-groomed animal pelt, freshly cleaned and smelling of soap. In fact, <em>all</em> of her did. Someone certainly was freshly bathed, though the bottoms of her feet remained dingy. Not to mention all the scars everywhere.

Cairn stopped in the doorway, letting out an audible gasp. Her hands plapped to her cheeks, and you could almost see the stars in her peach-brown eyes.

Her ears, however, were slightly splayed--as between them, a cowboy hat was planted, held in place by a drawstring beneath her chin. 

She seemed perfectly human apart from her ears and tail, though a better look at her face revealed the equally inhuman detail of peach-pink colored eyes.

After finally having successfully tried everything and stored enough to last &#39;til the next morning, he decided to take a sit not far from the piano, as music was something he didn&#39;t have the luxury to partake in until now, as well as anything remotely linked to luxury, actually.

And then there was another tiefling. And this one very much Wanted to be seen, with her definition of &quot;semi-formal&quot; seeming <em>extremely</em> generous. 

Wearing a sweeping maxi dress with a silky, sheer train and sleeves, decorated in details reminiscent of butterfly wings and in rich, vibrant hues in a gradient down her body from plum purple to cyan at the very bottom of the dress, the tiefling&#39;s own anatomy very much matched her outfit. Dusky violet complexion, incredibly long dreadlocks that were a bright indigo at her scalp and shifted all the way to an intense magenta at the tips, currently wrapped in an up-do that looked uncannily both lazy and elegant, and the most vivid cyan eyes, adorned in flecks of more magenta in the corners... she was a lot. Pale freckles dusted her cheeks and nose, and her horns grew to encircle atop her head like a crown, with a third, smaller horn in the center of her hairline, adding a touch of unicorn to the crown-like appearance. And behind her, an unusually long tail was perpetually swirling through the air, ending in a tip whose &quot;spade&quot; curled into a filigree-like shape of a heart.

Dark velvet heels with shining cyan stilettos as narrow as needles clicked on the polished hardwood as she strode into the room like she owned the place, making her way over to the gathering by the buffet table--offering only a slightly cheeky wiggle of her fingers in the direction of Kaleva on her way--without any of the hesitancy of so many prior arrivals.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At the piano, Nikotiemus was having his own quiet, internal struggle. His music suffered for it. Still beautiful regardless, on his worst day he would still display more talent than many, but there was something about the tilt of his shoulders, the void of expression on his face, that showed his heart wasn&#39;t in to playing.

Nikotiemus nodded to Ellipsis as he departed, taking another moment to nurse from the glass of water, thinking back to his playing. By his own personal standards, it had been shoddy. His mother would still have loved it, but frankly he found himself a bit ashamed at his performance.

This would not do. His mother had raised him to embrace his talent. To let it flourish. To have such a paltry performance be what he was remembered by tonight just would not sit well with him, or his mother&#39;s memory. Decisively, he set down the water glass and turned back to the piano.

And when he began anew, it was as though life was swept back into him, into his music. He played his mother&#39;s favorite song, and with it, poured his love into the performance.

He started to pick a variety of meats and disposed all of them in the shape of a heart, as he would do for his numerous younger siblings back at the orphanage, but realised there was a possibility that the sleeping genasi did not eat meat.
He then arranged, around the meaty heart, a little assortment of everything strictly vegetarian on the table, separating the two parts with potatoes and bread.
He laid the plate in front of his target, then brought him a glass of water and a glass of wine and stood, for a second, proud of him right next to his most recent piece of art.

He then, silently, left the room, respectfully waving and smiling at Altaira if their gaze were to match (or if his gaze were to be caught in the abyss of her eyes), quietly thanking her from afar.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He respectfully waited for a pause in the music (this young man was one <em>hell</em> of a musician!) before tapping the side of his glass with a fork a few times.  A loud, crystaline ringing filled the common area.  Gregor waited for the various conversations to die down before clearing his throat.

&quot;Thanks everyone!  I&#39;m not really one for speeches, so I promise I&#39;ll keep this short!&quot;  His gruff, booming voice filled the room.  &quot;Let me just start by thanking the lovely and hardworking Altaira for organizing this get-together.  I also want to thank Valentine for preparing this wonderful banquet on such short notice!  Unfortunately she couldn&#39;t make it tonight, but if any of you would like to thank her in person, you can find her at the Creeping Root Inn, just down the road!  I promise she&#39;ll take good care of you down there.  Finally, I want to thank all of you for stopping by tonight!  You all look fantastic, especially you lot.&quot;  Gregor grinned at the cluster of folks in hats (one of which had just assumed the shape of a giant frog in a sombrero) hovering around the food table and tipped his floppy top hat to the lot of them.

&quot;For those of you I haven&#39;t met yet, my name is Gregor Blackscar, and I help Altaira run this little band of misfits.  The two of us are happy to welcome each and every one of you to the Valehunters guild!  Looking around this room, it&#39;s clear to me that we&#39;ve got one <em>hell</em> of a group of recruits on our hands, and I can&#39;t tell you how excited I am to show you lot what&#39;s to come!  I know business has been slow, but things are gonna start picking up around here.  The two of us - mostly her, if I&#39;m being honest - have been hard at work chasing leads and negotiating contracts.  We should be ready to start sending teams out in the field sometime in the next month or so.  In the meantime, I want help get you lot used to the kind of work we&#39;ll be handling in this guild!

&quot;Starting two weeks from now, I&#39;ll be running training sessions to help everyone warm up for the big boy missions.  Attendance isn&#39;t mandatory, but I recommend swinging by if you have the time.  My training sessions don&#39;t usually last very long, and they&#39;re perfect for anyone who may be new to this sort of thing, anyone looking for a little extra spending money, or even anyone who just wants to get to know their guildmates better!  Keep an eye on the notice board, the first sign-up sheet should be going up shortly!

&quot;That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got!&quot; Gregor said, scratching the back of his head as a sheepish grin spread across his face.  &quot;Please, help yourselves to the rest of the food - I still see a lot of cake left on that table!&quot;  

Gregor raised his wineglass in a toast.  <strong>&quot;TO THE VALEHUNTERS!!&quot;</strong> he bellowed.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Having a good time?” As Ellipsis nodded, Asterisk gave a smile. “I am too.
