Not for long periods of time. Not in a building filled with other people in their own spaces, the muffled clamor of voices all too audible to his lycan-enhanced hearing. For as cozy as the apartment was, for as comfortable a space he and Skena had made, there were days when the press of the walls and the sounds of their neighbors were too much and he just needed to get out and into the quiet of the forest. It&#39;s the reason he was away for a good portion of the day, when not otherwise occupied with other matters. It&#39;s what prompted his occasional bouts of wanderlust.

So it probably didn&#39;t come as a huge surprise when he told Skena he was going to make a trip to the Balgrove area and planned to be away for a few days. But this time, he invited her to join him.

As he packed a bag for the trek, he tipped his head over at Skena. &quot;Did you want to come with? I don&#39;t know if you have anything pressing with the guild, but there&#39;s a market that has some things they don&#39;t offer in this area.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He turned back with his tunic in hand, frowning at the puppy in his pack. &quot;Atreyu! Hsst!

&quot;<em>Drop it,</em>&quot; he repeated firmly, staring into those sweetly innocent pumpkin-colored eyes. There was a few seconds hesitation, and then slowly, reluctantly, the underwear was spit out. &quot;Good boy.&quot; He released him and had to make a lightning-quick grab for it before it was snatched up again, sighing as he straightened back up and avoided the dancing mini-horse bouncing around him in excitement.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The telltale jingle was familiar, and in a moment the rope toy was forgotten and the puppy was immediately at the door in a perfect sit, vibrating with excitement, his tail thumping a sharp staccato against the floor.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

After checking to make sure Gummy was empty to maximize her harvesting capacity, she headed back out into the main room, her messenger bag hanging diagonally across her torso and her minion scarfed across her shoulders. She grinned softly at the sight of Atreyu, doing a last minute pat down on herself to make sure she wasn’t forgetting anything. 

“For all his antics, his training is coming along pretty well. Every time I’d see those hounds around town, they always had such an intelligence to them. It’s so neat to experience it up close,” she murmured, reaching to give the puppy’s head (which was about eye level with the necromancer herself) a soft pat.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Still, I don&#39;t want to be completely militaristic with his training. I want him to be able to still have fun, but also recognize when it&#39;s time to be serious.&quot;

His first couple of times taking Atreyu down the stairs had left him with bruises as the enthusiastic idiot had yanked Kaleva top over teakettle right down after him.

There was a large farmer&#39;s market being held, though, and their proximity to the feywilds means they get some stock you can&#39;t easily get anywhere else. Some of the stuff they sold made me think of you.&quot;

An Andalusian gelding with a spackled gray and white coat was tacked up and waiting for them, tethered to the gate and grazing. It was a quick matter to speak to the stable hand, pass over his payment, and get the pair of them saddled up and on their way, Atreyu&#39;s leash attached to the saddle.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Skena settled in at Kaleva’s back in the saddle, comfortably resting against him as they traveled. “Once we get out of town further, I bet we could practice recall by letting him walk with us off leash,” she thought out loud. “And if I get bored I think I might start saddle breaking him by having Gummy ride him. Because it will look precious and it will entertain me.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“… He has some manner of affection for me. It’s hard to describe. He has a brain that, if he were a normal, living creature, would be able to produce dopamine and feel a kind of love, but it’s also… it’s a strange iteration of affection he has, because all it really is is that he has access to enough of my mind to know what love is, and he’s learned when it’s an applicable reaction to something. It’s an imitation, I guess, but everything he does is an imitation of life. So in that respect, it’s perfectly real for him. And he’s very fond of me, I’m easily his favorite person—and not out of some sort of obligation; I’m not sure he comprehends that my demise would mean his as well. I don’t think he understands that I brought him into existence and I could… I don’t know. Turn him back off. There’s no sense of that kind of dynamic in how he views me. He doesn’t feel like he owes me anything. He was designed with a purpose, and he likes serving that purpose. He likes helping me. In any way, but especially in the ways he’s skilled at. But the cat influence in him is fickle and fluid, giving him an independent streak and a bit of that attitude like… like <em>I’ll do what you’re asking, but I’ll take my sweet time with it, and I’m only doing it because it was my idea, not because you told me.</em> Dogs are people-pleasers, and cats generally lack that need to serve. So like… if I told him—<em>really</em> told him—to go take a bath or something, the cat in him would be very cross with me and he would express a great deal of contention. But there’s an even deeper part of him that gets fulfillment out of abiding by my wishes, because that’s what his purpose was, and fulfilling that purpose is gratifying. Does that make sense? The various influences of all his components make his behavior so nuanced sometimes.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Atreyu had gotten really good with his recall - hadn&#39;t even strayed far to begin with, and though there were a couple instances of him starting to chase the occasional rabbit or deer, he came back when called.

The saddle practice was a bit rough, though. Atreyu was far too excited at the thought that Gummy actually wanted to play with him and kept spinning around to try to fling the minion from his back so he could tackle him. Not much headway had been made there.

Balgrove was a nice place, though it was still clear to Kaleva that there was some bias that went on. Nothing extreme like what took place further north, but people tended to <em>look</em> a little too long with caution, and every so often someone would move to the other side of the street from where they were at, skirting out of their way nervously. Nothing outright hostile, but just enough that the profiling was felt.

Nothing he couldn&#39;t handle.

Eclipse was brought to the stables for the time being, and a room rented out at the inn for a single night. Once their things were dropped off in the room, Kaleva brought Skena over to the market, searching the stalls for the fruit stands. &quot;Ah... here we go. There are three particular fruits they bring here from the feywilds that I wanted you to try. Now this is a blue java banana.&quot;

The bananas in question were unmistakably blue - a mild aquamarine color about the same size as a regular banana. He paid for one and peeled it, offering a bite to Skena. It smelled sweet, and had a taste and texture not unlike vanilla ice cream.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In traveling from Cusai to Aedrenor--both following her banishment as well as on the errand to buy the puppy--her path had been further to the south, so Balgrove was uncharted territory for her. And an interesting ecosystem, to boot. Just a touch of something tropical in the air, despite the forested wilderness; it led to glimpses of delightful flora and fauna rarities that she had been enjoying.

She followed along as Kaleva&#39;s shadow throughout the process of him getting the horse settled in and securing a place to stay, and only really started branching out again as he seemed to find what he was looking for at the market. Her attention settled on the banana he offered towards her, a look of gentle intrigue on her face as she listened to him speak on it a moment, before obligingly leaning forward and nibbling off a bite from the end. 

Standing up straight again, she chewed thoughtfully, letting the taste take root in her mouth, before blinking a few more times and looking up at her friend. &quot;It&#39;s so creamy... and sweet,&quot; she marveled quietly, reaching to take the rest of the banana from him. Could she eat it all in one sitting? No. Did she want it in her possession despite that? Yes.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
