The sun hung low in the sky, casting long shadows across the unlit living quarters.  The spacious room wasn&#39;t exactly <em>messy</em>, but it was cluttered.  A pile of damaged armor lay in a haphazard pile in one corner of the room, waiting for the day when its owner would finally take it down to the smithy to have the dents hammered out and the chainmail coif repaired.  In the opposite corner, an ornate weapon rack, meant to tastefully display a series of blades, was barely visible beneath the pile of the twenty someodd weapons set to lean against it.  Swords, axes, flails, spears, pikes and mauls of all shapes and sizes formed a precarious and anxiety inducing jenga tower around the rack, which looked ready to topple over at the slightest touch.  A series of shelves, overflowing with all manner of knick knacks - both magical and mundane - dominanated the back wall, and no more than a few square inches of wood were visible on the polished, cherry wood desk in the middle of the room.  The surface was covered in a spread of maps, diagrams, open tomes, missives and most of all, paperwork that had been accumulating for weeks.

Gregor groaned and pulled himself into a sitting position, causing the bed to creak under his weight.  He sat on the edge of the bed for a few moments, rubbing the sleep from his eyes, before forcing himself onto his feet with a great deal of grunting and sighing.  Yawning, he arched his back - generating a satisfying series of loud cracks - and began getting dressed.  Once presentable, he left his quarters and slowly plodded out into the hallway in search of food, still only about 80% awake.

As Gregor trudged past Altaira&#39;s chambers, he remembered her mentioning an urgent matter that needed to be discussed with him.  Something about some sort of meet and greet with the new recruits?  It was important that they discuss matters &quot;as soon as possible.&quot;  That conversation had taken place five days ago.  Gregor sighed.  Guess there was no more putting it off.  He raised a meaty fist to knock on her door and, catching a reflection of himself in the window, paused.  He licked the palm of his hand and fussed with his unruly hair, trying to get it to lay flat.  Finally, nodding with satisfaction, he turned back to the door.

<strong>Knock knock-knock knock</strong>

Without waiting for a response, he creaked the door open and poked his head in.  &quot;Heeey yooooooou! How&#39;s my favorite lady?&quot; Gregor asked cheerfully.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Yet he was greeted the same way he would have been if the drow inside had invited him in directly; she looked up from where she sat at her desk, having been reading a small stack of papers over a cup of coffee, offering a simple nod towards the large man who was intruding.

She was almost equally as large, albeit her largeness was of a different variety. The woman was tall, discernible even when she was sitting, and had the thick, intimidating frame of someone who <em>might</em> be able to deadlift a horse. Her skin was dark and dusky, a relatively typical complexion for a drow, with snow white hair that turned more charcoal towards the roots, tied back into a neat ponytail against her neck. Gregor had seen her before, he had seen an immense quantity of her, but there was still something unnerving in her eyes—which looked not like tangible, spherical parts of anatomy, but like two windows into the astral sea, almost a touch disorienting to try to focus on—and no amount of familiarity seemed to ever alleviate that <em>entirely.</em>

“I am well. Thank you.” Though her common was fluid, she still bore an accent of the undercommon that was her mother tongue. Looking back to the papers in front of her, she set down her coffee, freeing both hands to tuck the pages into a neat pile, which was then set aside.

“If you make a habit of waking up at the same time that I do, Gregor, there will be no one running the guild during the day.” Her tone was... wholly unbothered. Maybe even a touch on the gentle side. “There will be mutiny on our hands.”

The peaceful morning quiet settled pointedly around her, perhaps indicating her variety of a jest.

“Do sit.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His broad shoulders nearly filled the width of the door frame as he passed through it.  

Gregor frowned at the wooden guest chair sitting opposite her desk and scanned the room, searching for- Ah, there it was.  The cushy armchair Altaira used for reading sat behind her, resting by the fireplace.  Gregor invited himself behind her desk and, grabbing the back of the heavy chair with a single, meaty fist, and spun it around to face her.  He settled in and leaned back, his right foot resting on his left knee.  Once he was comfortable, he nodded past Altaira with his chin, gesturing at the stack of papers on her desk.  &quot;Watcha readin&#39;?&quot; he asked, trying to stall and keep the conversation from entering Work territory as long as possible.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“New recruits,” she replied smoothly—and just like that, Gregor’s attempt to weasel out of that topic had danced him directly into it. The drow picked up the paper stack, extending it towards him in offering. 

“The work on them has all been done,” she said, potentially in reassurance. “Those who choose to live in the guild hall have been settled in. You should meet them. For many reasons, but not the least of which being this,” she continued, her other hand tapping a forefinger on another page sitting on her desk as well.

“There is a lead in the marshes, southwest of here. The guild will perish if it idles much longer.” A pause. Hard to say exactly where her unnatural gaze was pointed, but it seemed heavy on Gregor’s face for a moment. “And you may, as well. New projects will be good for you.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her comment clearly had some sort of an effect on him, though it may be difficult to tell to what extent.  Gregor let out a low whistle as he thumbed through the list of recruits.  &quot;Whole lotta tieflings,&quot; he remarked.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It can be easy to forget other places are not so nonplussed with their kind. Or mine, for that matter,” she continued, almost sounding a touch amused at the observation. 

“Some have applicable skills, but they are all green. I’ve arranged a social gathering in a few day’s time to allow them to acquaint themselves with each other—and you. Then it will simply be a matter of familiarizing them with enough of a skill set to feel confident taking them out into the field. And I believe my approach for training is... a bit more <em>militaristic</em> than most prefer.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And <em>occasionally</em> someone went to bed with a broken bone because Ophelia&#39;s healing magic couldn&#39;t keep up with the abuse doled out by your sparring sessions.  And yeah, you <em>did</em> make Olfnir cry now and then.  Well... a lot actually.  Like, <em>a lot</em> a lot...&quot; Gregor trailed off for a moment as he got lost in memories of the <s>good</s> old days.  He stared off into the distance with a bleak expression for a long moment before clearing his throat and snapping back to the present.  &quot;But I wouldn&#39;t call your methods <em>militaristic</em>,&quot; he continued with a chipper tone.  &quot;I would, uh... I&#39;d call them thorough!&quot;  He shot Altaira a big grin, having successfully managed to put a positive spin on things.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She leaned back in her chair, head tilting slightly in a way that indicated her gaze wandering thoughtfully towards the ceiling. &quot;It has been some time since your kobold friends were put through their paces, as well,&quot; she mused pointedly.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Kitten&#39;s nails have been getting pretty long too.&quot;  His grin broadened as he recalled the last batch of recruits and their first face-to-face encounter with the giant owlbear who lived in the woods behind the guild hall.

After a few moments of contemplative silence, Gregor nodded toward the document Altaira had tapped earlier.  &quot;You mentioned a lead.  Down in the marsh?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Reports have been coming in from all over, as usual, but that marsh seems to be seeing an uptick in odd occurrences. I&#39;ve been keeping an eye on it over the last few weeks; it&#39;s starting to look promising. Nothing definitive yet, but promising. It is likely a good goal to aim for in the short-term. But in the more immediate term, making acquaintances is in order, as we cannot move in any direction until &#39;we&#39; ourselves are established.

Don’t let the time get away from you. And do not neglect the notice board, or I’ll have to drag you in front of it myself.” Despite the fact that at least by the look of her, she very likely <em>could</em> physically drag Gregor around just fine, the words were so nonplussed it was hard to register them as a true threat. 

“And whatever is going on behind your eyes, it is likely secondary to proceeding with plans for proper training exercises, so do not lose sight of those, either.” A beat. 

“Beyond that, I currently have nothing else for you, no. I will keep an eye on reports from the swamp, and I will let you know how that does or does not develop.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The room was an absolute mess.  The floor was littered with crumbs, crumpled dirty clothes, various bags and satchels, empty inkwells and broken quills.  One corner of the room was filled almost entirely with piles of hundreds and hundreds of books, haphazardly stacked in towers that leaned precariously.  It was a wonder the entire structure hadn&#39;t collapsed.  Resting against the wall behind the books stood a massive bookshelf.  Its mostly empty shelves would certainly provide adequate storage for the tomes should their owner ever miraciously develop a habit of putting things away.  The desk on sitting against the far wall was home to even more books, many of which still sitting open, and a towering pile of dirty dishes.  Cobwebs stretched between the plates and the surface of the dusty wood paneled desk.  A two year old piece half eaten toast sat atop the topmost platter like a sad little crown.  On the opposite wall was a bed, where a lanky figure lay in a tangled, chaotic mess of covers, gently snoring the morning away.  A puddle of drool slowly spread across the surface of his pillowcase.

<em><strong>rrrrRRrrRRRrRRRrrr</strong></em>

Whatever Wesley had been dreaming about was interrupted as the growl some great beast roused him from his slumber.  With a yelp, he rolled over and promptly fell out of bed, jostling several of the towering stacks of books.  As he was trying to sit up, the towers collapsed, sending a small avalanche of heavy, leatherbound tomes crashing down on top of him.  Groaning, he gingerly extracted himself from the pile of books and stood up, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.  He looked around the room in bewilderment; he had been expecting the cramped quarters of his dorm room, and it took him a moment to realize where he was.  &quot;Oh.  Home.  Right..&quot; he mumbled to himself.  &quot;Yaaaaay....&quot;

Wesley plopped down on the edge of the bed and began trying to remember the events of the night before.  He remembered grabbing his book bag and rushing toward the portal room as soon as finals were over, eager to get back to Fielbarry.  Almost immediately after awkwardly joining the party Altaira had thrown, he was reuinited with his dad, who had greeted him with the traditional bear hug.  &quot;Explains the bruising..&quot; he mumbled, rubbing his sore ribs.  After that, after that... He racked his brain trying to remember what had happened next.  He remembered a flutter of wings, a glimpse of blue, cricketlike legs... &quot;ELRABIN!&quot;  Wesley  leapt to his feet and scanned his room in a panic, searching for any sign of the little devil.  Only after he was <em>certain</em> he was alone in the room did Wesley ease himself back onto the side of the bed, though he remained on high alert.  He had no idea how the little blue bastard had managed to follow him home.  Maybe he had seen Wesley take the Fielbarry portal back at the college and followed through?  Maybe he had lowjacked Wesley&#39;s bookbag with some sort of magical tracking device!!  Maybe-</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-863936877328597032 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=863936877328597032><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, July 11, 2021 5:16 PM">5:16 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em><strong>RRRRRRRRRRRrrrrrRRrrRRRrrrrrrrr</strong></em>

Wesley jumped as his stomach growled a second time.  He chuckled nervously and took some deep breaths, trying to lower his heartrate.  Whatever, the situation with El would have to wait.  Wesley realized none of his memories from the night before involved eating dinner, and he was <em>starving</em>.  He looked down and was surprised to see he was not wearing his school robes, but his pajamas;  a baggy, grey shirt with a thunderbolt logo on the chest and black fleece pants with cute little owls printed across the fabric in a repeating pattern.  He shrugged, he seemed presentable enough.  Wesley walked over to the door, slipped on a pair of bright blue fuzzy slippers, and sleepily began the long descent through the guild hall&#39;s many levels toward the mess hall, yawning and scratching his head along the way.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As he crossed the room to reach the stairs down to the ground floor, he would suddenly collide with a projectile person out of nowhere. There had been no sound of footfalls, barely a visual warning before a girl slammed face-first into him.

And then there was a noisy flutter of something, another confusion blur of motion--as a little finch was knocked free out of her hands in the impact, where it took off to seek refuge in the far corner of the commons&#39; garden, chirping little scoldings all the way. 

&quot;<em>SHOOT</em>. Wait--I&#39;m sorry!&quot; 

Wesley may or may not recognize the girl from the night prior, though she had largely kept to herself during the fiasco of his arrival. She was a bit on the petite side, fair-skinned with nut brown hair and ears of a matching color that were currently awkwardly twisted at the sides of her head, her gaze--an abnormal peach-pink color--shifting between her apology to the man she had barreled into and... looking with wistful disappointment after the bird she had loosed. 

&quot;Sorry,&quot; she repeated, her attention equally split, but both subjects seeming equally important to her. &quot;I didn&#39;t hurt you, did I?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Startlingly blue eyes peered out at her beneath a heavy set of eyelids and a tangled mess of black hair.  In fact, the left side of his long hair stood almost straight up, like a rooster&#39;s tail.

He looked at her.  Then at the bird.  Then back at her.  The back at the bird.  After a long pause, he finally asked &quot;.....is that a finch?&quot;

Maybe.&quot; She sounded a little insecure. &quot;Hm. Hhhhang on...&quot;

Her gaze wandered around the room, sizing up the terrain. And then she slipped away from Wesley and started moving along the wall opposite where the bird had landed, ducking into a crouch and flattening her ears as she reached and was able to hide behind the dining tables laid out there. She was incredibly quiet, at least, and there was something about the way her eyes never left the bird and her movements were slow and measured that was reminiscent of watching a cat stalk a small animal. 

Except she wasn&#39;t a cat. She was, more or less, a human--but she was doing her best with her given anatomy. 

At a snail&#39;s pace, she moved along the edge of the room, to the garden wall in the corner opposite the bird. And then she began to creep along the garden&#39;s edge, using it as incredibly meager cover as she shifted past the piano and closer to her quarry. 

Before she rounded the protruding bend in the garden, which was currently concealing her from the bird&#39;s line of sight, she slowed to a halt. And she&#39;d stay there for a long stretch of time, wide eyes locked on the unfortunate finch and ears flat against her head. Then a brief glance down, assessing the stonework and plant life between her and the bird, before her gaze locked back on target. 

Though she did not move at any inhuman speeds, she did launch herself quite suddenly forward, deftly choosing the exact location of each of her movements as her left hand braced on the lip of the garden&#39;s stone edge, helping pull her up until her left foot could take its place, further propelling her forwards so her right hand could dart out for the bird. The bird burst into a flurry of frantic flapping and shrieking, and stray feathers were shed as Daarka&#39;s fingers at first clasped only tufts of down that easily came loose. But just as quickly, she redirected her momentum to keep on target as the bird began to take off, her left hand flashing out and managing to crudely snag the poor critter&#39;s entire tail and yank it out of the air.

Her landing was less graceful, her legs kind of going wherever and ending up with her on her knees on the floor. But she bounced back up easily enough, her tail going nuts as she darted back over to Wesley. Still holding the <em>Very</em> unhappy finch by the ass.

&quot;I did it! I did it again!&quot; She squealed, almost <em>more</em> happy than the average person would be about such a thing.

She stood there for a moment, before glancing over to Wesley, as if checking to see if--yep, he was still staring at her expectantly. No opportunity for hijinks. With another big, slightly melodramatic sigh, she relented and released her grip on the bird--who, at the slightest opportunity, shot out of her hands like a bat out of hell, fucking off to probably Siscia. 

She watched it fly off, perhaps a stroke of mild regret on her face, before seeming to shrug off that bummer, dusting the little flecks of lingering feathers off her hands. &quot;... Your name&#39;s Wesley, right?&quot; She addressed him, looking back up with a simple, amicable smile. Like none of that bizarre encounter had even happened.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Daarka&#39;s ear twitched, and she looked back to the bird just in time to see the hawk snatch it out of the sky. Unlike Wesley, she looked wholly unfazed. &quot;Wow! That was fast. Never thought I&#39;d say I was jealous of a hawk, but here we are.&quot;

Well, kind of.  You see- hold on, I&#39;ll be right back!&quot;  He stood up, rushed back to the breakfast spread, grabbed a fist full of bacon, and hurried back to the table.  Swept both plates off to the side and began drawing crude stick figures with the sticks of bacon, illustrating the effect of the spell as he spoke.

&quot;Okay, so you say you started off as a fox.&quot;  Wes &quot;drew&quot; a small stick figure on all fours, with little bacon ears and a bacon tail.  &quot;Then along comes this witch and <em>poof!</em>  New body.&quot;  He made another stick figure, this one a human standing on two legs.  &quot;What most likely happened was that you were the target of True Polymorph, an extremely powerful form of transmutation magic.  True polymorph can essentially take one thing-&quot; he pointed to the bacon fox - &quot;and turn it into another-&quot; he pointed at the bacon person - &quot;permanently.  The spell has it&#39;s limitations though.&quot;

Wesley reached down and plucked the foxes body from the table, chewing on it as he continued.  &quot;You see, generally the spell replaces <em>all</em> the characteristics of the first body completely.  All trace of whatever the creature or animal or entity was before is erased and replaced with the body of the new form.  Obviously, this didn&#39;t happen to you.&quot;  He moved the little bacon ears and tail from what was left of the fox figure and rearranged them around the human stick figure.  &quot;You were allowed to keep bits of your original anatomy for some reason.  If I had to guess, the decision was intentional on the part of the witch, though I couldn&#39;t say <em>why</em>.&quot;

Or for just about any non magical creature. But giving them a closer look… it wasn’t just a flat color. Under scrutiny, it looked more like the base color was something akin to honey—but a layer of pink dust coated over that original hue. The result was that unique, soft, rose-quartz like shade… but to Wesley, it was more than a cosmetic change. It was a lingering thumbprint of aether itself, left in the wake of the magic’s touch over her anatomy.</code></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Like, anywhere.” She gave a halfhearted flail of her arms. “This shape isn’t meant to be comfortable. You have to build entire furniture pieces to compensate for how impractical it is. I’m lucky I still have nails and teeth that aren’t completely useless,” she added, emphasizing her point by wedging the (surprisingly sturdy) claw of her forefinger into the edge of the table’s wood. “If all your fancy stuff was taken away, you’d all freeze or starve or be eaten by bears.” A beat.

“… Beds are pretty nice, though.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It&#39;s true that most humans don&#39;t have as many natural weapons or abilities as some animals and that we rely on our tools to make up for those deficits, but isn&#39;t adaptability and the capacity to invent solutions to problems that would otherwise be unsolvable worth the trade?

“I’m proud of what I am. I don’t think most of my siblings survived. But I did, and I was the runt. And no matter how many ways that farmer set up things to keep me out of his chicken coop, or how many different kinds of traps he laid out for me, none of it ever stopped me and none of it ever caught me. I think my mom and dad must have been really smart, because if not, I wouldn’t be here right now; I’d be like that finch. The farmer was human, but neither he nor his fancy traps and barricades could stop me. And I’m proud of that,” she said easily. Because self esteem problems did not come naturally to animals. 

“<em>That said</em>… my life is much more interesting now. Much more comfortable, even though my body is weird and impractical. And I would have gotten old and died by now as a fox—and I have no idea how old this body can get, but every day I have as a human is more than I would have gotten otherwise.” She grinned at him. “You asked me earlier if I was angry with Y’vadora for taking away my original life. <em>Absolutely</em> not.

But then he tasked her with something she <em>could</em> manage, and she blinked, turning to look around. A second or two passed, before she made a little beep of a triumphant noise, jumping to her feet and darting towards the guild&#39;s notice board--where a pen was readily available for those in the guild to use to sign up for missions. Grabbing it, she turned to bounce back over to Wesley... and the pen slithered out of her grasp and drifted through the air back towards the notice board. She tried again. And again, the pen seemed insistent on staying where the gods (or Altaira) had intended it to remain. 

Making a bit of a face--because this was a lot of confusing magic crammed into just the last five minutes or so for someone who didn&#39;t have a good grasp on magic to begin with--Daarka pivoted where she stood, pesky pen in hand, to face Wesley. &quot;I think you have to come over here,&quot; she called back to him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He sidestepped out of the way as the pen smacked into the notice board and clattered down onto its resting place below the board.  &quot;Huh!  Altaira commissioned some sort of binding spell to solve the kleptomania problem.  Neat!&quot;

..Wes still needed a pen, and this one would not do.  He turned on his heel and began power walking toward the staircase back up to his room, his little slippers slapping against his heels as he walked.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He didn’t say why he was leaving, and this pen seemed perfectly fine to her. So she simply stood there, clueless, waiting to see what came next.

Whenever Wesley came back down, there would be a new player who had joined the game. While Daarka remained exactly where Wesley had left her, curiously toying with the enchanted pen, there was now also an intimidating drow standing tall beside her, hands folded at the small of her back. Altaira’s bizarre gaze turned to settle on Wesley, her expression the same measured patience it always was.

“Good morning, Wesley. Would you kindly explain?” She murmured freeing a hand to gesture into the mess hall where one of the tables was on its side, ceramic shrapnel scattered about.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In one hand he balanced the book, an inkwell, and a spiral shaped shard of fractured ceramic.  His other hand held a quill, with which he hurriedly scribbling notes while muttering to himself.  

Wesley didn&#39;t even notice Altaira until she spoke.  He yelped and visibly jumped a few inches as she greeted him, sending the paraphernalia flying. &quot;M-ma&#39;am!  I didn&#39;t see you!&quot;  Wesley snapped to attention as everything clattered to the floor around him.   The inkwell shattered against the floor, its contents spreading in a gloopy black puddle that was dangerously close to lapping at the edge of Altaira&#39;s boot.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But Altaira didn’t flinch, not even so much as batting an eye. The ink came dangerously close to her boot, but it didn’t have the gall to touch it.

“Why are things exploding in the mess hall?” She reiterated patiently, her tone not exactly scolding, but it’s usual unhurried calmness, the tone she used for everything. Which was almost worse in its ambiguity. “And the furniture left in disarray?” Again she nodded towards the overturned table and ceramic shrapnel.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He dared not make eye contact.  &quot;I thought I&#39;d be nice and clean the dishes for the kitchen staff, but I think I.. overdid it?  My spell seems to have compromised the ley-web binding one of the plates together.  It&#39;s the same concept as unravelling magical energies through the use of abjuration magic, except I seem to have inadvertantly disrupted the natural flow of magic residing within the plate itself, exposing it to the surrounding, atmospheric energy that permeates our world.  Normally this isn&#39;t an issue - in fact, leylines suffer fractures and tears and manage to self correct all the time.  In his works on equallibrium, Tenser theorizes that this is due to the self stabilizing nature of magic in its natural state.  While we often <em>perceive</em> arcane energies as being volatile and chaotic, the truth is it is actually an incredibly stable energy source.  This is what makes aether crystals such a reliable source of power.  It is only when arcane magic users tamper with aether and try to bend it to their will that it takes on more chaotic properties.  According to all known laws of equillibrium, the hole I tore in the plate&#39;s ley-web should have self corrected, but the fact that it didn&#39;t is <em>fascinating</em>.  Do you see how the ceramic fractured in such a distinctive pattern?  This suggests that...&quot;

Wesley would continue to ramble on in such a manner unless interrupted.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In fact, Altaira waited until he had run himself dry with his explanation, then allowed a beat of silence to hang between them. And then, simply, she replied, “Please clean up the current mess. Without the use of magic that may result in further explosions.” She glanced down to the shattered inkwell. “As well as this new mess. Leave the hall in proper condition for the other hunters, yes?” She took half a step, pivoting a fraction away while still looking at the boy—the body language of someone who was expecting an incredibly concise and brief final response.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He set about cleaning the messhall at once, instinctively kneeling down and waving his hand to wipe away the puddle of ink in a wave of prestidigitation magic.  Realizing his blunder, Wesley tensed up mid-spell.  Slowly, he looked back up at Altaira, pre-emptively wincing as if preparing for some sort of punishment or scolding.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She trusted Wesley was averse enough to that idea that he would find a way to make things work. 

Daarka, meanwhile, shared none of Wesley’s anxiety—but did seem to be curious about his suddenly-weird mannerisms. Kneeling down to help him pick up shards of the inkwell, she grinned softly. “Who’s Tenser? You keep bringing that name up. Is he a friend of yours?
