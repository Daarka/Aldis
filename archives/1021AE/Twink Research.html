It wasn&#39;t the most unusual occurrence. 

There was a massive gash in his face where something had bludgeoned him severely enough to split his cheek open and warp the shape of his nose, and he had that smell of charcoal to him that indicated he&#39;d been in a fight. He turned on the sink faucet, spitting a mouthful of blood into said sink, before pausing, and then lifting a finger to distractedly push at one of his sharp teeth, testing how secure it was in his gums. Good enough.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The housekeeper who was standing on a ladder polishing the crystal chandelier paused in her work to stare at the trail of blood, and with a resigned sigh, started to climb down so she could get it cleaned up.

Setting the book onto the side table next to the loveseat, Niko went to follow Arseni into the kitchen, moving into his line of sight and quirking a brow at him, then signing, <em>&#39;Need a heal?&#39;</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He seemed to consider Niko&#39;s offer for a moment, before his jaw clenched and he shook his head with a flash of something extremely stubborn, scowling away as he leaned down to crudely splash water over his face. 

After a few seconds of this, he sat up again, his face now dripping water <em>and</em> blood. <em>&#39;That drow bitch wants to see you.&#39;</em> He signed, before reaching to unceremoniously crunch his nose back into place with a snort of blood and a sound that Nikotiemus could probably feel.

He turned to walk away, paused, turned back, and signed again, <em>&#39;Don&#39;t put it back in the icebox if you use it. Just throw it out when you&#39;re done with it. Or eat it.&#39;</em>

He glanced towards the icebox... but ice never helped anything worth helping. He grabbed the high-thread-count hand towel by the sink and shoved it against his open wound to sort of contain the mess, before stuffing his other hand into his pocket and producing a little wad of paper, which he... somewhat more gently set down on the kitchen table. He stared at it for a minute, before grumbling something and walking away, returning a second later with a scrap of paper and a pen, which he haphazardly used one-handed to scrawl out an extremely short note. A bit of blood had gotten smudged on the paper, but whatever. Only then did he fuck off, going to his room to lie down and sleep off the ass whooping. 


Altaira would be easy enough to locate: in her office, the first place anyone would seek her out. A knock at the door would be met with an invitation to enter, and Nikotiemus would find her leaning back in her chair behind her desk, a long, heavy, wicked-looking war hammer of Xhorhasian design laid almost tenderly across her lap. This might have been threatening, however she was not brandishing it so much as she was propping it up to delicately clean it with a cloth. The cloth, a keen eye would note, had become a bit red-stained in said cleaning.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Niko stopped then, his gaze distant. The memory of the first night he met Arseni came to mind, his words made at the man&#39;s paltry little camp, when he told him not to take his mother for granted.

When he started signing again, it was slower, almost dazed. <em>&#39;He loved his mother. Lost her. Probably at a young age.&#39;</em>

A hesitation, and then, <em>&#39;He hates his father. I am not certain whether or not he is a lingering presence in his life, but I know the mention of him turns him volatile, and may have been the reason he came home blackout drunk not long ago.&#39;</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

And cities north of Fielbarry tend to be quite... intolerant of tieflings in some instances. The full story is one only Arseni himself knows, in all likelihood. But the facts of the matter are that he is wanted for the crimes, which took place when he was a teenager. He arrived in Fielbarry some years ago, a similarly short number of years after this is said to have occurred. It is not uncommon that tieflings stay here once they come to the town, as there is little persecution for their kind--or, truly, any other kind--here on the basis of identity alone.&#39;</em>

She fell wordless a moment, before stirring again, this time to lean forward and open a drawer in her desk. There was some rummaging, but eventually she produced a single slip of paper, which was laid flat on the desk, pivoted, and nudged forward to face Nikotiemus. 

<em>&#39;This is my personal copy, if you don&#39;t mind, but you may inspect it as you wish,&#39;</em> she signed. <em>&#39;I am not surprised to hear he expresses hatred for his father; the man was, by all accounts, unpleasant. Gorev Antonovich, a half-elven man who seemed to aspire to be a crime lord, given his dealings. Though, I&#39;m afraid, not a particularly skilled one, more prone to volatility than politics. Virtually nothing is on record about Arseni&#39;s mother, which does not surprise me. He is from the city of Laracus in the far north of Aedrenor, and there it is not atypical for tieflings to be treated as second-class citizens. If Gorev was in an ongoing relationship with the woman, it would be unsurprising that it was not publicized. It can be presumed that there was some manner of ongoing connection, however, as they both died the same day; the implication, as I understand it, being that they were in some manner of proximity at the time. While I pride myself on my capacity for research, even I could only find her name: Morning. Nothing more is recorded of her or her life.&#39;</em>

The paper she had presented to him was, in fact, a wanted poster--in case Nikotiemus was skeptical of the <em>entirety</em> of her claim. Whether or not he was truly guilty, he was undeniably wanted. The notice described his likeness quite uncannily, if not being a touch grandiose with his more monstrous features. His alleged crimes included the murder of one Gorev Antonovich and &quot;a tiefling woman&quot;, as well as--much more familiarly--arson, with a number of attempted murders tacked on at the end. The reward was seven hundred gold, dead or alive. To the average commoner, it was a handsome figure; to Nikotiemus, a paltry sum, and approximately the same as a paycheck for one mission in the guild.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Nikotiemus&#39; firm stance in the opposite direction certainly brought the intrigue back to Altaira&#39;s gaze. 

She dipped her chin slightly at his request. <em>&#39;If that is your wish, I will forward such information to you should I learn of it.&#39;</em> A pause. <em>&#39;In return, all I ask is one curiosity of my own, if you do not mind humoring me.&#39;</em> Her question was simple.

And really, that&#39;s all there was to it. Arseni had been there for him in his lowest moments. He went looking for him when he&#39;d gone missing. Tagged along with the rescue group uninvited. Stayed with him. All his other friends, the other noble-born, high-class peoples who he had mingled with, they had sent letters of condolences, empty words of sympathy and well-meaning. But it was Arseni who, though he had absolutely zero experience in being a comfort to anyone, had brought him comfort at all. Had physically been there for him, having known him all of a single night, had done more for him than all the rest.

His protection was the least he could give in return.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Whether you are in this role or not, and regardless of your specific skills, what is most important is a willingness to work as a team, cooperate and coordinate with the other hunters, and supplement the hunting party&#39;s needs with your own skills as other hunters supplement what you cannot. Beyond that... exact circumstances vary drastically based upon the mission itself. Some missions are... almost political, namely the reconnaissance missions meant to validate leads. These typically entail seeking out information from locals in the given area, or surveying the land for a trail. Other missions are much more labor-intensive, and can include quite testing trials of combat, or grueling activities such as wading through swamp water for hours.

The changeling stared blankly at him. Then signed to him, <em>&#39;That would have been a pointless endeavor.&#39;</em>

Arsast stared for a moment in confusion at his hand gestures, until understanding dawned, his lilac eyes widening comically. &quot;Ooooohhhhh. <em>That&#39;s</em> why I couldn&#39;t hear anything! Okay, that makes sense. Cool! Oh hey, I learned some words in sign language once!

Nikotiemus sighed, reaching out to give him a pat between the horns. Well done. He turned to walk off while Arsast grinned after him, tail wagging like a puppy. He then peeked in at Altaira. &quot;Hi, &#39;Tira! I had coffee!&quot;

...

Once back home, Nikotiemus went to search out Arseni. The housekeeper had cleaned up the mess that was left behind, as she always did, and Niko made a mental note to give her an extra day off and a rather hearty tip this week. She did put up with a lot, even if she was payed extraordinarily well. It&#39;s the least he could do to keep her interested in working there.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;An intriguing new experience for you, then. Good luck, Arsast.&quot;


Back at the nobleman&#39;s home, Arseni wouldn&#39;t be terribly hard to locate. He had pillaged some spiced rum from Nikotiemus&#39; stocks, and was curled up in his bed, his pillow now sporting a few smears of blood as he dozed off with the liquor bottle tucked under his arm. If it were a teddy bear, he would have looked like a child. Instead he looked like an idiot.

On his way through the house, however, Nikotiemus would potentially spot the wad of paper that had been left on the counter. It had a bit of bulk to it, looking less like a folded note and more like a crude package. Beside it was a scrap of paper, still smudged with crimson, that had crude scrawling on it reading, &quot;GOES IN YOU&#39;RE EAR&quot;. It was impossible to say if the grammatical error was natural, or a symptom of a budding concussion.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He cast Detect Magic over it, and sure enough, it lit up, indicating some manner of magic was tied to the piece of jewelry. He placed it upon his ear, and for a moment, nothing happened, but... His eyes widened, gaze drawn to the magically inscribed text of <em>Tick... tick... tick...</em> and followed it to the grandfather clock in the hallway, watching the word appear with every completed swing of the pendulum. He&#39;d picked up the vibration of sound before, like a metronome, constant and steady, but this...

He lightly rapped his fingers against the wood, and the word <em>Knock-knock</em> appeared in his vision as well. Fascinated, he couldn&#39;t help but smile, turning to head into the bedroom to find Arseni where he was, cuddled up to his rum bottle.

A faint exhale from his nose, and Niko sat down on the edge of the bed beside him, reaching out to gently brush his fingers across his cheek and cast a cure wounds upon his injuries. Not to completely heal it, but to take the worst of it away.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The tickle of magic earned a little sleep-snort, and he blinked groggily, pupils dilating and contracting up at the changeling, barely awake but already looking accusatory.
