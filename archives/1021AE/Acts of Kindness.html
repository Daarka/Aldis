Returning to Fielbarry with his rescuers, giving his testimony of what happened to the authorities, the recovery of the bodies, the funerals, the arrangement of his inheritance of his mother&#39;s estate and funds, the purchase of a house in Fielbarry and the purchase and moving in of furniture, instruments, and all of that.

Honestly, being kept so busy helped keep him from spiraling over what happened, but one thing was for certain. Living alone in this house left him far too alone with his thoughts, and he couldn&#39;t stand it. There were people who came by to clean the place and cook for him, but they didn&#39;t live there.

So once he was settled in, he had someone bring a message to Arseni, inviting him over for a visit.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not the gory bodies or any of those details, but the severely abnormal variable of Nikotiemus seeming to actually desire his presence in any capacity. So when the message came, he immediately found himself tense and uncertain again.

It took the messenger a bit of effort to find him, as his location around town wasn&#39;t the easiest thing to predict. The messenger also likely was subjected to an unfair dose of profanity and aggression, but that was par for the course. 

Not even knowing what he was doing, Arseni did, however, eventually end up on Nikotiemus&#39; doorstep. Antsy and irritable and, above all, confused. He stared at the door for a long time, debating if he should just fuck off; this was <em>absolutely</em> not the side of town where idiots like him blended in at all, and he felt severely out of place. 

But, finally, he did give in and knocked. Two knocks, both a bit rougher than they needed to be, resulting it a sound that seemed more like a stray object haphazardly hitting the door than someone actually announcing their presence.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He answered the door with a small, welcoming smile, and gestured Arseni inside with a signed greeting.

He turned to lead Arseni in through the spacious, high ceilinged house. The acoustics were amazing if the sound of Arseni&#39;s footsteps were any indication. The smell of a high quality, fresh cooked meal greeted them as they went into the dining room, two places set out and silver domes over the plates to keep the contents warm and most. Rotisserie chicken that fell right off the bone, covered in a golden, buttery garlic herb sauce and served with seasoned potatoes and grilled asparagus. A fresh caesar salad with croutons and parmesan sat to the side, along with fresh, warm pumpernickel bread and dipping oil. A crystal carafe was filled with ice water, and a bottle of white wine next to it.

It was all very, very extravagant.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He haltingly followed after Nikotiemus, looking around warily the way most people would walk through a dungeon. There was a trap somewhere, he just had no idea where it was coming from. 

As they reached the dining table, he didn&#39;t sit down, didn&#39;t move to touch anything. This felt extraordinarily unnatural. No one was nice to him, no one sought out his company, no one went out of their way to invite him to their home, no one <em>allowed</em> him to touch anything like <em>everything</em> he was currently surrounded by, no one made him dinner--

It was poisoned, wasn&#39;t it? It was poisoned. Nikotiemus was peeved over Arseni being Arseni and was getting back at him. Well, Arseni was no <em>fool</em>, not easily manipulated with shiny shit like this. He stayed standing, his body language almost leaned away from the table, his arms crossing tightly atop his chest as his tail continued to lash. He didn&#39;t free his hands to sign, he simply stared at his too-gracious host, that sour expression still on his face like it usually was, as he waited for the other shoe to drop.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Arseni&#39;s fiery gaze followed the signing, looking between Niko&#39;s hands and his face. And back and forth and back and forth. 

He couldn&#39;t... detect any hint that the changeling was being anything other than upfront. But his own brain told him that he <em>must</em> be acting with some ulterior motive. The last thing anyone in this world would ever do is invite someone as unpleasant and ungrateful and generally problematic as him to live in a place like <em>this</em>. 

His jaw clenched and unclenched repeatedly, his tail still going behind him. It took him an even longer pause before he responded again.

For once, he didn&#39;t look aggressive. Or indignant or irritated or frustrated or impatient or annoyed.

With all that stripped away, and up to his horns in unfamiliarity and uncertainty... he kind of almost looked scared. He definitely looked lost. And the absence of his puffed-up demeanor and posture had him even looking a bit smaller, too, the five-foot-and-change tiefling dwarfed by the environment and circumstances around him.

He watched Nikotiemus sign, before looking down at the finely prepared meal in front of him. He was visibly still trying desperately to process everything, so it took him a moment, before he slowly formed a response. <em>&#39;I&#39;m not dressing like you or shit like that.&#39;</em> Despite the implied tone to the message, that tone didn&#39;t exist on his face. His face just looked unsure. Nervous. Uncharacteristically vulnerable in a way that was almost a bit volatile.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And the changeling sipped from his wine and started in on his meal with all the manners and decorum of the nobility that he was.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He just stared for a long time, more and more of his typical demeanor draining away until he was sitting rather hunched in on himself, his jaw tight and his eyes a bit wide. Even his long, elfin ears had splayed back a little, and--oddly--the coarse bristles that made up his mohawk seemed to even be lying a little flatter.

It was probably the nicest thing anyone had ever said to him in at least the last decade.

The changeling would be well into his meal before Arseni slowly stirred again, reaching for his fork (if there were multiple options, then the biggest) and slowly, dazedly beginning to pick at the chicken. He said nothing further, no longer looking at Nikotiemus. His gaze remained down on his plate as he ate, with none of the poise of his host. Just slowly, mindlessly shoveling food into his face as if in a trance.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He even ate primly, cutting his food into small bites using the appropriate silverware, of which there seemed to be far more than necessary. Chewing with his mouth closed, taking water or a sip of wine only after everything was completely swallowed.

It did seem like Arseni was going to accept his proposition. Or at least, he hoped he did. And it settled his nerves and put Niko in a rather relaxed mood. He honestly had very little idea of what to expect from Arseni as a housemate, but as long as the tiefling left his instruments alone, he felt he could handle pretty much anything in the way of odd behavior. And part of him was glad for the potential hiccups, too. Arseni would keep him guessing, and that would keep things from getting monotonous.

It wasn&#39;t until he was getting into his dessert - a slice of fluffy chocolate silk pie - that he paused to tap at the table with a fingernail to get Arseni&#39;s attention, signing to him.

<em>&#39;How do you think that tiefling bartender would react if both of us walked into the tavern and I looked exactly like you?&#39;</em>

Apparently Nikotiemus had forgotten she was blind.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Or, at least, lost his immediate tension to resume his confused daze. He had been eating like a relatively normal person, using one fork on literally everything--except the chicken, which he picked up to eat with his fingers when he realized there were bones to chew the meat off of (how was a fork supposed to accomplish that?). Picking croutons off the salad and leaving the lettuce to rot, moving between types of food chaotically instead of working through it all in any sort of order... and then, as he started to get full, resorting to just abjectly mutilating the surviving olives and tomatoes from the salad, as if only for the sake of making a mess on his plate. 

This was derailed for a bit as he considered Nikotiemus&#39; question, before letting his fork clink down and signing back--his movements still stiff and slow, <em>&#39;I don&#39;t know. Probably attack both of us.&#39;</em> 

He was still too stunned by the current situation to also remember the futility of this idea.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was certainly a lot of food. And the amount that Nikotiemus managed to put away was staggering considering how lean he was. Fast metabolism, or did he simply just... not allow the fat to collect? Changelings were weird and confusing.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
