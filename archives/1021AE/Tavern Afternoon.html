He had a glass of wine in his hand and wore a white, ruffled shirt that had a collar that buttoned around his neck and billowy sleeves. Seemed to cover everything nicely in the front, but it was actually backless to accommodate the extra appendages. Brown pants with khaki pinstripes fell over unguligrade, goat-like legs that ended in cloven hooves, and his twin tails moving in synchronization for once, the tufted tips swaying from side to side.

While most tieflings tended to look like oddly-colored humans with weird eyes, horns, and a tail, Luka seemed to be a bit more of an extreme variety. Or at least, had more devilish traits. One pair of horns curled around and under his ears, and a second, shorter pair swept up and back from his brow. His wavy, shoulder-length hair started off a royal purple at his scalp and then faded into sunset reds, oranges, and finally ended with yellow tips that matched the yellow of his pupilless eyes. Tall and willowy with a distinctly roman nose, he wasn&#39;t bad to look at at all.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

With only one tail and one pair of horns, no wings, slightly more pastel colors, and eyes that were clouded over in a milky film, Valentine was a familiar face to any local--and one usually accompanied by friendly thoughts. So at least Luka had that going for him; a Pavlovian reaction (in his favor) to the very shape of his face.

Val led him over to the bar, giving his arm a pat before slipping around behind the counter herself. She had only barely situated herself, resting her tall, orange staff with its unblinking eye against the wall behind her, when Luka would find himself (gently) accosted. 

&quot;Val, he looks <em>just like you!</em>&quot; Came the sudden voice of a young woman, the words almost a question in their delighted bewilderment. If Luka turned, he would find a small woman had popped up to his right, almost human if not for the immediately noticeable feature of the two large, brown-furred ears sticking straight up on her head and angled directly at the tiefling. Despite the childlike wonder in her declaration, she looked to be a young adult, and her round, peach-pink eyes held nothing but joy at this surprise. In fact, she seemed way more intrigued with the look of Luka&#39;s face than she did with his infernal mutations. 

&quot;Yes, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been told,&quot; Val replied amusedly from behind the counter. 

&quot;You&#39;re both so <em>pretty!</em>&quot; The girl&#39;s grin was infectious; sunshine to rival Valentine&#39;s herself. &quot;I hope I&#39;m not being rude. It&#39;s really nice to meet you!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In fact, that flash of pride seemed to indicate she was quite fond of her own uniqueness. 

&quot;I&#39;m not! I&#39;m a fox!&quot;

She... <em>wasn&#39;t</em>, but she did say it with such absolute surety. Still, she didn&#39;t leave him hanging long.

&quot;I ate too many chickens a couple years back, but the farmer couldn&#39;t kill me or stop me from doing it, so he had me turned into a human so I&#39;d leave him alone.&quot; She helped herself up onto the neighboring bar stool--and sure enough, there was a bushy, brown tail with a cream-white tip gently wagging behind her. &quot;I never know how to answer that question, because I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a word for me. But that&#39;s okay! I like still saying that I&#39;m a fox, because I never actually got to <em>say</em> that at all before.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I didn&#39;t used to have wings. Or a second tail and a second pair of horns, for that matter.

I&#39;m really good at it!&quot; Even as she responded, she was already pulling forth a messenger satchel at her hip, planting it on her lap to dig in it for a moment and pull out a scroll of parchment. It was only about eight inches or so in length while rolled up, but she wasted no time in spreading it flat on the bar top in front of her, deft little hands in practiced gestures placing four smooth stones at each corner to hold it down. &quot;I&#39;ve been doing one of this town since I got here to help me remember where everything is, since I&#39;ll probably be living here for a bit, I think. This is just the draft, I&#39;ve been jotting my notes on it as I go around during the day, and then transferring everything to a bigger map I have back in my room.&quot;

Despite how she explained it as being supposedly rudimentary, the cartography displayed on the map she unfurled showed clear signs of skill; meticulous line work, little nicks of graphite here and there to show great care had been taken on proper scaling--even tidy hash shading on various structures. Sure, it looked incomplete, and the &quot;notes&quot; in the corners were glorified chicken scratch, but she clearly had a solid idea of what she was doing.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
