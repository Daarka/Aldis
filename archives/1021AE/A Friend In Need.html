The famed changeling pianist never arrived at the concert, and no one had heard from him, his mother, or their entourage since they left Fielbarry three nights prior. Fearing something happened, a messenger was sent with haste to Fielbarry to hire a small group from the guild to investigate.

Kaleva and Skena had been chosen for the mission, Kaleva for his tracking and combative capabilities, and Skena for her healing, in the event that they found injured. Unexpected was the surly, fiery Arseni that had joined them, but Kaleva hadn&#39;t let it distract him from the job at hand, walking the road and searching for signs of a disturbance.

&quot;You&#39;re familiar with the people we&#39;re looking for, right?&quot; Kaleva asked the other tiefling after they&#39;d been traveling a while.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I didn&#39;t sign up to be fucking search and rescue or whatever.&quot;

Despite that, he walked directly with the other two, seeming for all the world to be a part of the little party. 

Providing demeanor whiplash was Skena on Kaleva&#39;s other side, visibly a little uncomfortable about the angry tiefling&#39;s foul mood, but doing her best to keep her eyes on the road.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He really didn&#39;t want to have to split his focus between tracking and watching his back. But he reminded himself that Skena was there and she could help keep an eye on the ill-tempered tiefling.

A bit of disturbed earth on the side of the road caught his attention, and he veered off path to approach the furrows in the earth, wagon wheels that had abruptly gone off track. &quot;Hold up... Let me check this out real quick.&quot; There was a steep slope in the woods, crushed foliage and broken branches, and Kaleva nimbly made his way down the edge, almost crab-walking to keep from slipping at points. A glimpse of bright red and gold-painted wood and the smell of death and the buzz of flies assaulted him, and as the ground leveled out, he saw fully what had happened to the carriage.

&quot;They&#39;re down here,&quot; he called up toward Skena, his tone grim and not laced with any sort of urgency.

The wagon was overturned, the horses that had been pulling it dead on the ground, along with the driver, the manservant, and a female changeling whose head had been brutally caved in by something, her blank white eyes staring up unseeing. All jewelry and coin purses had been removed, as well as anything of value on their persons and in the wagon. Flies buzzed their bodies, and there were signs that the local wildlife had already started to feast on the corpses.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Skena came to a halt at the top of the steep ravine, watching with a touch of her usual nervousness as Kaleva made his way down the treacherous decline. At his call back to them, she sighed, having been hoping for something more optimistic, before starting to carefully (and a bit less gracefully than Kaleva) follow down after him. 

Reaching the bottom with a wobble, she took in the sight, her face twisted slightly. Not exactly in shock and horror--gore didn&#39;t dissuade her like that--but certainly disappointment and pity. &quot;What do you think happened here?&quot; She murmured, beginning to go to the bodies one by one and look over the wounds herself, making for absolute certain there was no lingering life to salvage. 

Back at the top of the hill, their third wheel was getting irate, his tail lashing back and forth. &quot;Who the fuck is <em>they?</em>&quot; He shouted down.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;...An ambush, I think,&quot; Kaleva murmured, pointing to some scorch marks where some manner of fire magic had been used. &quot;Blade marks on the men, signs of fire magics. The ground was pretty level up on the road, so unless the driver was severely drunk or something spooked the horses, there&#39;s no reason they&#39;d have gone off the road unless forced to.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Arseni&#39;s scowl deepened. How dare he use his own words against him in such a reasonable way. He stayed put for a moment, but upon realizing he couldn&#39;t make out Kaleva&#39;s words as the other tiefling dropped back in volume to address Skena, his tail gave one final lash and he began to make his way down as well. Not with the nimble navigation of Kaleva, and not with the slow carefulness of Skena, but with a few rough jumps that would have had him landing on his face at the bottom if he didn&#39;t stay balanced. Managing to just barely maintain said balance, however, he shuffled to the level ground at the bottom of the hill, stalking over to see everything for himself. 

He&#39;d had a scowl on his face this entire time, so it was a bit challenging to understand what impact--or lack thereof--the sight had on him. While he showed no immediate signs of being horrified, he did seem to tense up a fraction where Skena and Kaleva had not. But wordlessly, he began poking around himself, walking a perimeter around the scene, and then, with potentially growing frustration, began to crawl on top of the carriage so he could pull open the door and stick his head inside.

Skena had fallen silent, watching the other tiefling stomp around the grim area, exchanging an occasional glance with Kaleva and... mostly waiting to see what it was Arseni was after.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I see some horse tracks leading away from here, probably the bandits... Might&#39;ve been taken hostage? ...Hang on.&quot; A stray bit of blood on a nearby bit of foliage caught his attention, and he followed it to find a single set of footprints, walking unsteadily away from the scene and the path the horses took, the occasional bit of dried blood smeared on passing leaves. &quot;Someone walked injured away from the scene. Might be our missing person.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Skena watched him storm off, her confused squint melting away instantly. She&#39;d known Kaleva long enough to pick up on idiosyncrasies like the movements of tiefling tails--but more than that, Arseni was a bunch of crude, raw emotions without the delicacy to disguise themselves, and she had spent her life being intimately familiar with the emotions of others. Moving forward, she tugged on Kaleva&#39;s sleeve, starting to follow after the other tiefling.

Though as the little group progressed, he was certainly conflicted between blazing ahead of Kaleva and moving independently of the other two, versus the fact that... Kaleva was following a trail, and Arseni didn&#39;t have the eye to do that himself. Or the nose. It left him alternating between storming ahead and then reining in his pace so the others would catch up and trying not to make it too conspicuous that&#39;s what was happening. But discretion wasn&#39;t really his thing.

Skena had released the breath she had been holding as the tension seemed to ebb back some, giving Kaleva a grateful look for having listened to her. As they walked, she hesitantly piped up again, looking towards Arseni. 

&quot;What&#39;s their name? We could be calling out for them to make sure we don&#39;t miss--&quot;

&quot;That won&#39;t fucking matter.&quot;

She blinked. &quot;... Well if... if there&#39;s a trail from the crash site, then there&#39;s a good chance they&#39;re still alive--&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not what I <em>fucking said,</em> bitch.&quot;

Skena was used to being ostracized, but being directly insulted to her face with pure vitriol and profanity was not something she had much of a resilience for, and it shocked her into silence again.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Slightly reassured by Kaleva coming to her defense, and put even more at ease as she reminded herself that she knew how to handle grieving people, Skena risked speaking up again. &quot;Why won&#39;t it matter?&quot;

&quot;Because he can&#39;t fucking <em>hear</em>.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Skena sighed softly. &quot;Do you know his name anyways? It might be useful to have handy.&quot;

There was a pause as Arseni seemed to actually think about the question for a beat. &quot;I don&#39;t know how to fucking pronounce it. It&#39;s a lot of stupid letters.&quot; He&#39;d forgotten pretty much all of them after the changeling had spelled N-I-K. Maybe his name was Nick.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He paused as Arseni tromped off, pausing and debating internally for a moment. His tail flicked, and he let out a low groan under his breath, before speaking up. &quot;Hothead.

There was a brief flicker of muted amusement as Skena watched Kaleva contemplate quietly giving the other tiefling the slip, but she continued to pick through the wilderness alongside Kaleva, letting her focus wane a bit from the tense conversation to instead keep her gaze out around them, looking for anything white.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Oh - excuse me!&quot; A woman&#39;s voice called out from the field of vegetation, her head popping up, floppy hat in place. &quot;Are you lot adventurers?&quot;

Kaleva paused a moment, blinking at the woman. &quot;Of a sort, why do you ask?&quot;

The woman wiped the back of a gloved hand across her sweaty forehead as she stood up, brushing off her knees. &quot;Just wanted to give you a heads up to be wary of undead in the area.

He studied Arseni for a moment, frowning a bit. &quot;Admittedly, I&#39;m curious as to how he knows this changeling,&quot; he said lowly, nodding toward the other tiefling. &quot;Seems like this guy comes from a lot of money, but...&quot; Arseni definitely did not seem the same.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The sun was just about to completely slip below the horizon, darkness setting in and painting the sky with deep blues and pinks, when a whiff of blood came to Kaleva&#39;s senses, off the road from them. &quot;Hold up,&quot; he called ahead to Arseni, and then turned to follow the scent, sniffing intently at the air.

Pushing his way through foliage, he spotted a blip of white standing out starkly in the darkness, and gestured the others forward.

Sitting at the edge of a small pond filled with algae was the changeling they were looking for. Dressed in a blue and silver paisley vest over a dove gray button-down shirt and matching gray slacks, the entire front of his chest and face were splattered with dried blood. His wispy spider silk hair was in tangles, and his once shiny leather shoes were caked in mud. He had his knees pulled up to his chest, arms wrapped around them, empty white eyes staring into the water as he moved in small, self-soothing rocking motions.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;... There&#39;s no way all that blood is his,&quot; she whispered softly to Kaleva, but she nonetheless extended a hand and sent a gentle tendril of golden light through the air towards him, where it sank into some of those visible wounds and began to seal them.

Arseni had changed course again as Kaleva called over, following them towards the pond. He paused for a brief moment at the sight of the changeling, before continuing forward where Kaleva and Skena had halted, unhurriedly making his way over to the bloodied man, reasonably confident Nikotiemus would hear him coming in his own way. He came to a stop about arm&#39;s reach from the changeling, looking over him with an expression that was hard to read; his toxic anger had simmered down dramatically in just the last several seconds, but there was no discernible pity or heartache or concern. Then again, a neutral expression on his face seemed equivalent to something much softer, given his baseline. 

Up close, even someone without medical training could tell the blood didn&#39;t all belong to him, largely due to the patterns of how it splattered onto him. Arseni had beat enough things into bloody pulps to know what that did to his clothes. 

Wordlessly, he slowly shifted to sit down next to him. Not touching him, not even fully looking his way. But settling into a sort of quiet <em>existence</em> in the space next to him that, especially to Skena and Kaleva, would seem jarringly out of character.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

This close, Arseni could hear a faint humming of some manner of song in the back of Niko&#39;s throat, and his rocking was in tune to the rhythm of it. It was almost a moan, the notes haunting and distant, but somehow still beautiful.

It didn&#39;t seem like he was aware of his surroundings whatsoever. Not just because he was deaf, but because his mind had shut down and turned off, wrapped up in the self-soothing motions of his body and the vibrations of his vocal chords.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Eventually, Arseni did take action, though it was small. His gaze settled more squarely on Nikotiemus, specifically the bolt sticking out of his back. Without moving his body, his tail slithered around in the grass, the bladed tip like the head of a snake as it started to move up Nikotiemus&#39; back, letting him feel it was there, gradually working its way towards the bolt.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But Arseni heard something entirely different. Within his head, a discordant melody shot through his mind to wrack it with searing pain, as if threatening to drag the tiefling down into madness with him. The music shrieked through his mind, and if not for Arseni being such a stubborn jackass, it might have sent him running away from him as quickly as he could.

The jolt of psychic assault had his movement pausing, his expression twisting slightly in a grimace as he lifted his hand to scuff the back of his knuckles under his nose and wipe away the loose flow of blood that had sprouted from one nostril. But that was all. He didn&#39;t recoil, and his tail didn&#39;t shy from the bolt, wrapping securely around it and flexing to pluck it out of his body now that he assumed the psychic tantrum was over with. 

Leaning over some so he could try to put himself partially in Nikotiemus&#39; field of vision, he simply signed, <em>&#39;Hey. Knock it off.&#39;</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Arseni&#39;s eye twitched slightly as the telepathy entered his skull, not used to so much brain magic invading his thoughts. But sensing that open communication flowing both ways, he replied in kind, signing along with his unspoken words. <em>&#39;I know. It&#39;s a big thing.

That makes a lot more sense than you hurting someone you loved, doesn&#39;t it?&#39;</em>

&quot;... In a weird way,&quot; Skena whispered, &quot;it&#39;s probably extremely fortuitous he&#39;s here. Neither of us know sign language... maybe it&#39;s easier to listen to him when he&#39;s not speaking.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Indeed, the double communication seemed to be helping pull him out of his spiral, his gaze locked on Arseni&#39;s hands. And slowly, slowly, he released his fingers from his scalp and signed back with shaking, unsteady hands. <em>&#39;Bandits. Ran us off the road. Mother was protecting me.

His hands lowered to his lap, clasping each other tightly to try to stop the shaking, crystalline tears abruptly spilling down his cheeks. He bowed forward, curling in on himself, eyes shut tight.

Off to the side, Kaleva murmured to Skena, &quot;What do you think... Should we set up a camp here, or try to see if he&#39;ll walk with us back to the farmstead?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

If possible, she would kneel within arm&#39;s reach of both changeling and tiefling, her eyes on the former to try to gauge his reaction to her being there. Unless he recoiled or protested, she would extend a hand--not to touch him, but to delicately cast a spell. It was one she generally tried to stay away from, but this seemed like a circumstance where it couldn&#39;t hurt.

For as small and slight as Skena was, Niko&#39;s perceptiveness to vibrations alerted him to her presence when she moved in beside him, and his head snapped up as she reached out a hand. He stared at her uncomprehendingly, but the moment he felt that magic attempt to affect his mind, he recoiled against Arseni and opened his mouth in that silent scream once again, rebutting her kindness with the same psychic melody that had assaulted Arseni earlier.

Arseni gave a faint <em>oof</em> as Nikotiemus pushed back into him. Skena, however, had a much more visible reaction, recoiling slightly as a splitting pain jolted through her head, a stifled cry leaving her. The odor of rotting meat began to ebb from her as, through her pained wince, slightly discolored blood seeped from her nose and even the corner of one eye. 

She didn&#39;t know why she thought this time would be different; she really shouldn&#39;t ever use that magic. She had no one to blame here but herself. 

Though she wasn&#39;t scared away, she settled back to sit on the ground fully, taking a moment to try to get her head to stop spinning as blood poured from her face. Arseni watched for a moment, his expression hard to read, before he pushed back into the dwindling availability of that telepathic link to convey to Nikotiemus, <em>&#39;She&#39;s ugly, but she&#39;s here to help.&#39;</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Niko sat with his back braced against Arseni&#39;s chest, shaking and breathing raggedly. He signed curtly, his hands moved to the side to allow Arseni to see, <em>&#39;Tell her to keep her magic</em> out <em>of my mind.&#39;</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Arseni was hardly used to being anyone&#39;s security blanket, so he sat a little stiff as Nikotiemus backed fully against him. Nonetheless, he caught enough of what he was signing, turning his frown back towards Skena. &quot;He says don&#39;t fuck with his head. He just had some fuckers mind-control him into killing his mom, for fuck&#39;s sake.&quot;

Skena winced again, sighing shakily. &quot;... Can you... Can you please tell him I&#39;m sorry? I wasn&#39;t... trying to mind control him, just help him relax. But I won&#39;t do that again.&quot;

Arseni gave no verbal response, using the last threads of that telepathy to instead speak to the changeling. <em>&#39;She&#39;s an idiot, but she&#39;s sorry or whatever. She&#39;s not gonna try again.&#39;</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Kaleva finished setting up both the tents he&#39;d brought along, glad he&#39;d had the presence of mind to have two on hand in the event they&#39;d found survivors and had to camp out.

Arseni was still completely out of his element, but he continued to not protest. Even he, apparently, could read the room <em>sometimes</em>. His arms didn&#39;t move around the changeling at all, instead settling back to prop him up as he stared off at nothing over Nikotiemus&#39; head, but after a few moments, his tail slithered through the grass again to loosely drape its tip over the changeling&#39;s leg, encircling him in a very... noncommittal way.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The feeling of Arseni&#39;s tail draping over his leg drew Niko&#39;s attention, and he glanced down at it, reaching down after a moment to curl his fingers around the spaded tip, lightly pressing with his fingers to see if it was bone or cartilage underneath the skin, if it was malleable at all. A small distraction from his misery, but a distraction nonetheless.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Arseni doesn&#39;t make the smoothest translator, and gods only know what he conveyed to the changeling on my behalf, but he mentioned something about some magic having been used to cause the man to kill his own mother. When he felt the same kind of magic from me trying to calm him down, that&#39;s when he lashed out.&quot; The tone and the look on her face made it clear she was still heavily kicking herself about it. &quot;You&#39;d think I&#39;d learn.&quot;

Arseni&#39;s tail was, in fact, of some sort of rigid material. Potentially cartilage internally, as it maintained its shape well, but still managed to provide a bit of give when flexed under Nikotiemus&#39; fingers. The edges of the tip--which seamlessly transitioned to the rest of his tail--were almost the same externally as the rest of his tail, with a fleshy exterior, except that flesh became denser and more akin to something chitinous towards the tip, until the sides of the diamond shape at its end narrowed into nearly blade-like edges. Arseni didn&#39;t even look down at Nikotiemus&#39; hand as the changeling began prodding at his tail, making it potentially possible that he couldn&#39;t even feel the touch there... or he was just zoning out and didn&#39;t particularly care about his tail being poked at for the moment.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Niko wasn&#39;t sure he&#39;d ever get this opportunity again, given how salty Arseni usually was. Both hands now took the tiefling&#39;s tail in their grasp, examining with detached interest, lightly squeezing or tapping with his pearlescent fingernails. But after a time he let Arseni&#39;s tail go, and he lightly tapped the other man&#39;s knee pointedly to get his attention before signing to him. <em>&#39;Where am I supposed to go from here...? What am I supposed to do?&#39;</em>

Because despite being in his early twenties, Nikotiemus had still been very much under his mother&#39;s influence. He&#39;d never had much of an opportunity to forge his own path.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Arseni did glance down at the tap, though he gave no response for a long moment, seeming to grapple with how to best answer the question. People didn&#39;t usually cuddle him, and they <em>certainly</em> didn&#39;t come to him for philosophy questions.

Slowly shifting his weight off his arms, he sat up straight again and signed back, his movements slow, <em>&#39;Back to Fielbarry for starters. Probably. Get a bath. Some food. A warm bed. You don&#39;t have to figure anything else out right now.&#39;</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Half-lidded, empty white eyes watched Arseni&#39;s signing, and at the mention of a bath, looked at the blood all over himself once again. And strangely, his features pinched in distress at the thought. His fingers rubbed together absently, some of the dried, rusty blood flaking away. There were also... <em>pieces</em> and bits of more solid matter. One such piece even had a few tangled strands of white hair attached.

He knew prestidigitation. He did. But he couldn&#39;t comprehend using it in this instance. He needed to scrub himself, needed to feel the abrasion on his skin, and such was the force of his scrubbing that he was leaving pink lines on his pale, moonlit skin.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She&#39;d never known her parents, let alone lost them in such a morbid way, so it was hard even for her to wrap her mind around his grief. But she at least appreciated that she couldn&#39;t.

Wasn&#39;t of any fancy or high quality material, but it was wool and would help keep him warm. At least it was long enough it... <em>hopefully</em> would cover everything. The changeling was a bit on the tall side. Unfortunately he had nothing to offer for pants.

Nikotiemus spent the next forty minutes or so in the cold water, scrubbing both himself and at his clothes, long scratches from his nails now trailing over his arms, chest, face, and stomach. Shivering violently, he kept scrubbing at his vest, but the stains were still there, set into the fabric, and he let out a choked, anguished scream of frustration as he threw it abruptly away from himself and sank back into the water, burying his face into his hands.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Setting the pile in the grass, he began to go through each piece of clothing to one by one wring them as tight as possible, getting as much moisture out as possible, before spreading them out on the ground. When they were all mildly damp but no longer dripping, he stood, using his foot to nudge them together into a pile, taking the opportunity to also plant a hand on Nikotiemus&#39; arm and nudge him back a few paces as well. Then, turning back to the pile of bloody laundry, he held one hand palm-up, and exhaled a short, quick hiss of flame into his waiting grasp. As it sat between his fingers, the flame seemed to be rapidly growing in a spiraling vortex; he didn&#39;t hold it long. With a motion not unlike throwing a playing card, he briefly curled his wrist in and then flicked it back out, sending a thin spurt of flame onto the clothes. 

In an instant, a small <em>inferno</em> had sprouted up, swirling around to create an almost tornado-like burn at least as tall as Arseni was, and almost as wide. Whatever hiss and pop there was of the moisture left on the clothes burning up was drowned out in the wooshing snarl of the fire, though Arseni didn&#39;t bat an eye--despite Skena jumping out of her skin from across the clearing.

Instead, he just stared into the fire, his tail finally falling still. 

Burning your problems always solved them.

But the heat washed over him and fought off the coldness that had taken hold of him, and when it finally guttered out, leaving nothing but ashes and scorched ground, Niko felt something in him finally let go, and he let out a long, heavy sigh.

He walked over to the small campfire and the pair of tents, reaching out to take the tunic from Kaleva and pulling it on over his head. It came down to mid-thigh on Kaleva, but on Niko, it barely covered his backside. Still, he signed thank you, then gestured toward both tents with a questioning glance.

The indecision probably wasn&#39;t hard to glean from his demeanor, as he stood awkwardly for a moment, contemplating just... starting the long walk back to Fielbarry instead.

He stared at him a long moment, clearly having a bit of trouble registering the concept, before just... wordlessly starting towards the second tent, dropping down to push inside it. And fully expecting a look of surprise and discomfort on the other side, frankly.

Skena had not yet crawled towards bed herself, instead sitting in front of the fire with Kaleva. Because it was warm, he was warm, and she was not. And she wasn&#39;t about to go cuddle Arseni.

She watched him disappear into the tent, before softly murmuring, &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen someone as easy to read as he is. It&#39;s like... like he understands his own emotions so little, he can&#39;t even begin to try to disguise them.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But I had Marko to help teach me.&quot;

Inside the tent, Nikotiemus had curled up on the thin pad, underneath the blanket - and had deliberately slept to one side of the tent, leaving room for another. Curled up in the fetal position, his head cradled in the crook of his elbow, his exhausted features turned up toward Arseni. Silently, he held up the blanket in invitation.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Slowly, his movements a bit uncertain, he crawled down beside him, slipping under the blanket where invited. 

Though his body was rough to the touch and a bit on the prickly side, with seemingly nothing on his anatomy being smooth or soft, he brought with him a welcome glow of warmth, far more than typical body heat, even more than a typical tiefling. In this climate, not enough to be sweltering; perhaps, at the height of summer, sleeping beside him in such a way would be uncomfortable. But right now, with Nikotiemus still damp and cold and night fallen around them in the middle of a tent without insulation, the little piece of shit whose very presence seemed so wont to ruin any room he walked into actually seemed to make the tent perfectly comfortable for sleeping just by being there.

If he was aware of the benefit of his body heat, he wasn&#39;t acting like it, still a bit stiff and uncertain in his movements as he settled in, his body not touching the changeling&#39;s. 

Skena gave a quiet, thoughtful hum. &quot;... You&#39;re probably right, though it&#39;s still... strange to me. Usually, someone who isn&#39;t well adjusted enough to just... answer simple questions without flying into a rage... they wouldn&#39;t know how to be vulnerable in any capacity. To an extreme. And he... in some ways has followed that trend, but... once we got here, he showed a great deal of selflessness all of the sudden. Even he looked confused by it.&quot;

She drifted off from her musings for a moment, before sighing and tucking in against Kaleva&#39;s side. &quot;Behavior fascinates me. I wonder where that fleeting tenderness comes from in him, when he seems to make such an effort to never touch anything of that nature with a ten foot pole. He didn&#39;t even know how to pronounce this man&#39;s name; I struggle to believe his rapport with him is just so deep that his behavior would shift so strangely.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Once Arseni was settled in, Nikotiemus curled back up, shuffling slightly closer but still not touching, his eyes closing as he lay there curled up just inches away from the spikey sass child. There was vulnerability and trust there, for whatever reason, though he&#39;d only known Arseni through their single interaction previously.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I guess the crush idea would make sense,&quot; Skena admitted softly. &quot;... Sometimes I think I forget people do that.&quot;

Arseni lay perfectly still on his back, staring up at the top of the tent with a faint frown on his features. He was confused, he was uncomfortable, he wasn&#39;t used to people extending vulnerability to him. The changeling at his side was a myriad of uncomfortably new and foreign interactions and, as with most things he felt any emotion towards reflexively, that put him on edge. But he didn&#39;t bother the man, didn&#39;t touch him, didn&#39;t do anything except stare at the tent&#39;s ceiling like it had wronged him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The tent&#39;s ceiling loomed, clearly judging every decision Arseni had ever made in his life, and found him lacking. As for the changeling, he was asleep in minutes, his breathing evened out and his fine, pale features finally losing that haunted, tormented look. The one arm pillowed his head, but the other hand was resting slightly extended from his chest to brush his pinky finger against Arseni&#39;s hand. It was pretty gay.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

What all does it entail? Just... liking someone? Liking being around someone?&quot;

Arseni didn&#39;t know how to handle any of it. After a few long minutes, he rolled onto his side, turning his back on the changeling and pulling his hand out of gay range, his tail curling around the front of his legs as if to neatly remove itself from the equation. And he stayed there, somewhat pouting, until drowsiness began to overtake him as well.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

They occupy a lot of your thoughts, and it makes you happy when you think about them. There&#39;s a longing to be with them, too.&quot; Kaleva paused, then added, &quot;Romantically. I think that&#39;s an important distinction.&quot; Little wonder Arseni was confused, then. The guy didn&#39;t seem like he&#39;d know romance if it hit him in the face.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
