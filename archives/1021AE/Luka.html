As it pulled up to the marketplace, the occupant inside thanked the driver politely and stepped out, carrying a suitcase. The man was a tiefling, tall and willow-thin, with purple skin and yellow eyes, and gently waving hair falling down just past his shoulders in every color of the sunset. One pair of horns curled around his pointed ears, while a second, smaller pair swept up from his brow. His tail actually split into two near the base, each moving separate of each other and ending with another wavy shock of that sunset-colored hair.

He wore a long, brown coat that looked just a little bit too bulky for his slender frame, odd to see in the summer heat, and a pair of neatly pressed slacks over unguligrade legs ended in dainty cloven hooves. A leather belt around his middle and also around his thigh held a book holster carrying a worn-looking tome with abyssal script etched into the spine.

Tucking errant locks of wavy hair behind one ear, he made his way over to the tavern to step inside.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A tiefling worked behind the bar, almost matching his description exactly--though with some slight deviations. Her colors were a touch more pastel, her eyes--presumably intended to be the same yellow--clouded over to mostly white. Where this man had effectively two tails and four horns, she had the more typical one tail and two horns--but the resemblance was still uncanny, even their facial structures indicating an obvious relation.

There was one other familiar presence, though a less welcome sight, perhaps. Behind her, resting against the wall, was a twisting orange staff, with tendril-like features that, at the staff&#39;s top, curled around one large, unblinking eye. An eye whose pupil immediately shifted to the newcomer the second he stepped foot through the door. Valentine, who had just finished putting some freshly cleaned glasses away on a shelf, paused in her movements, her head tipping partially in the staff&#39;s direction. And then she pivoted more to face the direction of the door, a slow grin spreading on her features that looked as naturally a part of them as the color of her skin.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Because one should always be polite and Luka always acknowledged the presence within the staff. To Valentine, he added, &quot;Did you get my letter? I wasn&#39;t sure if Jaska wound up sending it or not.&quot; He didn&#39;t. &quot;Or if it would have been impolite forcing you to find someone to read it?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Oh, you wrote a letter? How rude of him--No, he didn&#39;t send it. Is everything alright?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That&#39;s frustrating. I wanted to let you know that I was coming back. I was hoping to give you some kind of heads up.

Of <em>course</em> you can stay with me! It&#39;ll be so lovely having you around again.&quot; She gave his cheeks a brief pinch, but didn&#39;t subject him to it for long. &quot;Here--I technically went on break five minutes ago, I just had nothing better to do than to keep loitering back there.&quot;

Withdrawing from him again, she made her way back behind the bar, reaching out to grab the gazing staff as confidently as if she could see its exact location, before returning to her brother and looping her arm in his. &quot;Let&#39;s get you settled in so you don&#39;t have to keep carrying your stuff around! And wearing that oppressive thing any longer,&quot; she decided brightly, giving him a moment to pick up his belongings, before leading him around some tables and towards the stairs. Even the few chairs that weren&#39;t pushed all the way in, she seemed to be able to navigate perfectly well; a testament to just <em>how much</em> she paid attention to the little noises all around her, including the absence of a chair being pushed in. 

Likewise, she traversed the stairs without issue, heading down the hall and past a good number of inn rooms until she reached a few that were spaced a bit more widely than the others. Apparently knowing <em>exactly</em> where she was, she stopped in front of the door at the very end of the hall, unwinding her arm from Luka&#39;s to dig a key out of her pocket so she could unlock the door and push her way inside. 

It was a bit minimalist for interior design, but then again, the resident was blind. There was no consistent color scheming, but at the same time, it all was a very cozy space. What she lacked in a need for visual pleasantries she made up for in accommodating the other senses; seating was plush and comfortable looking, surfaces were smooth and clean, and everything was very, very, very neatly (and specifically) organized. But Luka would expect as much, having grown up with her. 

Rhatihl was once again rested against the wall as she closed the door behind them once Luka had passed inside, too. &quot;I&#39;ll make it a priority to get you a second key made,&quot; she mused cheerily. &quot;And we&#39;ll likely have to move some things around; it&#39;s not the largest space since it&#39;s just an inn room, but this one was specifically made for someone who would be living here long-term, so it&#39;s a bit fancier than just a bed for the night. There&#39;s a spare room,&quot; she continued, pointing quite accurately, &quot;that I&#39;ve been using as a closet, since I don&#39;t exactly have enough belongings to justify the storage space. But I&#39;ll get a wardrobe in my room and clear those things out, and put a bed in there, and that should accommodate you just fine! The couch is plenty comfortable, but I won&#39;t have you sleeping there long term.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Where can I put my suitcase that won&#39;t be in the way?&quot;

For the moment the suitcase was set down at his feet so that he could pull off the coat and fold it over one arm, his leathery wings unfolding and stretching out carefully for a few moments, then settling back into a more neutral position upon his back. The shirt Luka wore was a fancy white ruffled thing, except it clasped around his neck in a sort of collar, and though it had sleeves that gathered at the wrists, it was also entirely backless - specially modified, as most of his shirts were, to accommodate the massive things.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Dropping her hands again, she leaned back, still beaming in his direction. &quot;Things have been good, Luka,&quot; she murmured warmly. &quot;Steady... a bit boring, maybe. But good. I&#39;ve been working at the bar pretty much the whole time, and the previous owner had some gold come in from the death of a relative, so she took the opportunity to retire, since she was starting to get a bit old to be managing everything. She sold the inn to me at that point, since she was so comfortable with my reliability. You know how... Gosh. I think it was shortly before we parted ways, I had some persistent insomnia, and I was just never able to sleep? This isn&#39;t exaggeration: I haven&#39;t slept since then. Not for a second. I feel perfectly fine, though, no different than when I <em>had</em> slept.

Is it due to your connection with Rhatihl, do you think? Are you even <em>capable</em> of sleeping, like from a sleep spell or something of the sort? Being knocked unconscious?&quot;

He turned toward Rhatihl then, asking the staff, &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you have any idea about it? If you do, I truly would be grateful if you would shed some light on the matter.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;You&#39;re too sweet for this world, Luka. He is <em>decidedly</em> no help, and certainly doesn&#39;t deserve your manners, but I know it&#39;s only your nature to offer them. Regardless, I do quite well on my own without his guidance; having his power to draw from has done a great deal to help me get by.&quot;

She paused, her expression going blank... before bopping herself on the forehead. &quot;I&#39;m a fool. We don&#39;t have to buy new furniture. I haven&#39;t used my bed since I moved in here except as a comfy place to sit. I&#39;ll move my things out of there and into the spare room, and it&#39;ll be all yours.

At her prompting, he reached down to unbuckle the harness keeping the book at his side, pulling it into his lap and reaching for his coat to fish a pen out of one of the inner breast pockets. &quot;Here you are.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The ink from the last words of his message was still wet when, beneath the small paragraph, more writing began to appear on its own, matching his penmanship. 

<em>&#39;I&#39;ve missed you, too. But you have nothing to apologize for. I&#39;m just glad you can return to clearer skies now.&#39;</em>

Approximately sixty seconds later, both messages began to melt away, as if the page was sucking the ink out of existence until there was only blank parchment once more.

Valentine&#39;s smile widened into a soft grin, her cheek still on his shoulder. &quot;Now you never need to worry about Jaska sending your letters again,&quot; she hummed. &quot;And if you ever find the need to link to others in this way, ask them to write their name here as well. No more than... hm. Maybe three more names. But you should be able to erase them with a touch if you need to undo a link.&quot;

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">&quot;Far Scribe&quot; - aka Luka benefiting from sharing a Book of Shadows with a higher level warlock. Copypaste:

A new page appears in your Book of Shadows. With your permission, a creature can use its action to write its name on that page, which can contain a number of names equal to your proficiency bonus.

You can cast the sending spell, targeting a creature whose name is on the page, without using a spell slot and without using material components. To do so, you must write the message on the page. The target hears the message in their mind, and if the target replies, their message appears on the page, rather than in your mind. The writing disappears after 1 minute.

As an action, you can magically erase a name on the page by touching it.</code></span></div></div></div></div></div>

At his second question, she paused, squinting as she thought through the nature of the magic and if it would be applicable there.

&quot;... I&#39;m... actually not sure why not. It&#39;s at least worth a try.

Oblivious to this, Luka grimaced faintly. &quot;It&#39;s been filled with an abundance of doctors, warlocks, and scholars from the bard college of Lore.

Either way, Jaska wasn&#39;t getting gratified with a reaction.

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s unfortunate. It&#39;s a shame your time there wasn&#39;t more fruitful, especially if all it did was upset Jaska.&quot; Her full lips pulled to the side a little as she stewed on the news. 

&quot;But you&#39;re away from all that, now. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s some degree of a relief to Jaska, at least. And hopefully you as well? There&#39;s plenty of room for both of you here, and... I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s a nice town. Very accepting, very diverse. Even the wings wouldn&#39;t get you gawked at, I don&#39;t think; folks of every race pass through here at one point or another, so the locals are used to seeing all sorts of things and getting over themselves.

His name is Mahva, and I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll like you, too; he&#39;s a lovely resident, honestly. I have no excuses for that shop, though, other than that the owners seem personable enough. Not exactly the malicious type, despite my suspicions.&quot;

She leaned back against the plush cushions, her tail lazily swaying back and forth over the edge of the couch, sweeping that wavy shock of sunrise-colored hair across the rug. &quot;I&#39;ll gladly find ways to pay you if you want to help out. And I&#39;ll speak to Jaska on it the next time he&#39;s around, so I can understand where he stands on the matter. Obviously I don&#39;t assume he wants to run a massage parlor, but if he&#39;d still be willing to help out if he takes over on one of your shifts, I could set aside coin for him, too, to spend how he chooses. If you two don&#39;t already split your finances, might I suggest it? I could help make sure he doesn&#39;t have access to your money when he&#39;s awake, in return for giving him his own funds to handle at his discretion. I feel like anyone would appreciate having that kind of independence, but I&#39;d have to talk to him about it to fully understand.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He buried his head in his hands, bowed forward with his elbows on his knees. &quot;I&#39;d wake up in some of the most... <em>Humiliating</em> circumstances, and...&quot;

His shoulders quivered, and for a moment it almost seemed like he was crying?

Jaska would be able to feel the low, simmering irritation from the direction of the staff, the kind that came from being involved once again with someone it had been happy not being around previously. If Rhatihl had anything to say, Valentine, true to character, neglected to give him a voice.

&quot;As for tonight... Oh, you had said you were on break earlier, when I first came to the tavern. I&#39;ve probably kept you overlong.&quot; He pulled out a pocket watch to check the time, then slipped it away again. &quot;We can head downstairs. I certainly don&#39;t mind.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Certainly. I&#39;ll pour you a glass here, though; you&#39;ll like this bottle better than what I have downstairs. I mean, I technically have this downstairs, too. But this one is already open.&quot;

The corkscrew popped the cork out with a soft accent of a noise, and with perfect form and no indication of vision impairment, she poured him a very Luka-tailored portion of wine. Then the bottle was recorked, stored away again, and the glass passed off to her brother. &quot;Give it a sniff, I think it&#39;ll be up your alley. Let&#39;s head down and I can get you situated at a comfy table, and--when did you eat last? The food here is lovely, if I do say so myself. And the evening crowd should be coming in soon, so you may even get a bit of a show with your meal, whether from the yuan-ti or otherwise.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Standing up straight again, she departed the room with him, locking the door behind her, and started back downstairs with him. &quot;If you want to post up at the bar, it&#39;ll almost be like I&#39;m sitting with you,&quot; she mused lightheartedly. &quot;But we&#39;ll have to go see who all the night drags in. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll enjoy yourself.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>
