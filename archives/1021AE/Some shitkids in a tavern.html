Black cats, of course--even those who looked slightly purple in certain lighting--were omens of bad luck. 

The bad luck didn&#39;t follow far behind in the form of a petite purple tiefling with long dreadlocks and an even longer tail that gracefully tangled in and out of knots behind her, her horns framing her head in a shape reminiscent of a crown, and her clothing scandalously minimalistic. She could almost be presumed to be wearing evening loungewear, possibly even sleepwear, with a sinfully comfortable looking crop top and high rise shorts... but yet there was something about them that managed to also look just as much the part of a presentable outfit for going out in public. And the sleek, subtle little heeled shoes supported that theory. And yet she looked... <em>magnetically</em> lazy in the best of ways, while still looking fashionable and attractive.

It was paradoxical and hard to get a beat on, but it was working for her.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Olive skin, black hair tied back into a bouncy little spikey ponytail, goatee, and lilac purple, almond-shaped eyes. The fur on his forearms and on his unguligrade legs and tail was a coppery brown and black. He wore an open vest and some stretchy harem pants, both black with mint green, tribal-looking designs.

His long, goat-like ears bounced with each mirthful leap around her, the clop of his hooves chaotically audible against the wood floor. &quot;And then!! He does this thing where he swims up beneath you at full speed, and pushes his hands up beneath your feet, and launches you right up out of the water! I think I&#39;ve been launched some thirty, forty feet in the air, easily! It&#39;s so much fun! You have to come swimming with me &#39;n Papa sometime!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Chairs, tables, countertops, window ledges. He even launched himself at one point, grabbing onto the chandelier and swinging from it before launching himself across the room, only to spring back over to her proximity without missing a beat.

&quot;From what I hear, Papa&#39;s pretty damn good at that,&quot; he said with a rakish grin. &quot;My moms and his other lovers certainly haven&#39;t had any complaints.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The tiefling made some slightly distracted, wistful noise in the back of her throat. &quot;Mm... Aye.&quot; A beat. A <em>long</em> beat. Before her gaze finally returned to Arsast, the temporary glaze over them lifting. 

&quot;Ye even giddier than usual, what with him in town,&quot; she commented, the look of debauchery in her eyes being replaced with one of something much more wholesome. &quot;Why&#39;d ye never stick with &#39;em if ye like &#39;em around so much?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Val did happen to be on duty, if only because puppetting NPCs was annoying to some writers. The reigning tiefling, who had suffered Arsast jumping on her furniture without any outward protest solely because she knew the transience of his attention span and the inevitability of his energy levels, cast the little fey gremlin a smile. &quot;Sure thing, hun, one second,&quot; she murmured, fishing around for a moment until she found a stray sheet of parchment and a writing utensil, passing it over to him with the added promise of, &quot;Drinks will be right up.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not that Valentine ever seemed offended about anything. It would actually be wild if being told she should pole dance was what did it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Even if Valentine could see what he was writing, she wouldn&#39;t have been able to read it. It was nigh-indecipherable scribbling. Chicken scratch. Fitting that it was going to a pair of kenku.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Well, I appreciate what I am assuming is a compliment.

With the same pleasant smile, she slid both drinks across the counter towards him. &quot;Dancing in such ways isn&#39;t something I particularly care about one way or the other, so I lose no sleep over it. But again, I appreciate the presumed compliment.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
