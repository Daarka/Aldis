The novelty still hadn&#39;t worn off, and she was enjoying using it behind closed doors. For all the ways that their situation had changed though, in many ways it really... Hadn&#39;t. At least with current circumstances being the way they were, it was hard to really pivot when the days were filled with prep for the long voyage looming before them and left little room for anything else. The &quot;coats&quot; she commissioned had been picked up and subsequently dropped off for their enchantments, the pemmican prep had been almost entirely completed, and Cain and Cha Cha had really started to get the hang of the sailing knots. She did, however, intend to keep to their agreement that they&#39;d steal one more evening out in the town enjoying the peace and bluster of the coming holiday season, and that would come. Tonight though, she intended to keep another promise - one that she&#39;d warned him about that morning when he&#39;d left for his errands and she&#39;d set up a small assembly line on the floor of the kitchen.

Now, at the close of the day, she sat in one of the kitchen chairs and used her teeth to cut the last of the heavy thread she&#39;d been using to stitch leather together. Sparing the build in her hands a few moments just to give it a visual once-over and check the air flow once it was pressed against her face, she set the mask down on the table beside the others. Five simple full-face masks of dark, heavy leather, each one fitted with rounds of tinted glass over the eyes and an aperture over the mouth that jutted out like a short muzzle. And on the end, a much older version that had clearly been the blueprint - leather so dark it looked black, shiny with age and wear, the mouthpiece built upon and carved into until it resembled a snarling maw filled with rows of cruel looking fangs. The thick red glass covering the eyes had been cut into glowering almond shapes and set into their sockets under a sculpted brow. The entirety of the surface was covered in a filigree pattern - imperfect and messy in some places but clearly cut by the hand of its bearer. Old, worn, and with a light veneer of dust from being hidden away for years.
<em>Where it belongs,</em> she thought with a grimace, sitting back in the chair as her gaze fell on the familiar features. Her hand drifted to the bottle of rum she&#39;d dug out somewhere between the third and fourth masks, refilling the glass sitting before her, but setting it back down beside the empty one before the seat beside her. 
Was it excessive to have prepared these, knowing the only risk of needing them lay in a small fleet roaming the ocean on the complete opposite coast? Probably. But she had too much to lose now to not be over-preparing.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The man himself poked in through the doorway moments later, one arm hooked into the strap of his worn backpack that held just enough of a heavy rustle to suggest it’d been put well to use on his trip around town. “Evening, Niamh,” he called in as he spotted her at the table, turning just enough to shut the door behind him.

Slinging the pack from his shoulders, he carried it over towards the table to lean down and press a kiss in a newly forming habit, though his eyes were quickly distracted by the collection of masks on the table before her. He remembered her warning earlier that morning, the warmth in his expression from seeing her dulling some at the sight of the masks, peering ominously in silence at the ceiling as though in wait. While he’d seen plenty of different types of masks, these were unlike any he’d seen before, and that unfamiliarity curled with discomfort in his gut.

“Y’ve been busy. These look really well made.” He said, gingerly reaching down to pick one up to examine. Despite their nature, he was still cautiously proud she’d put together so many in one day with such care. He could only wish it had been for better circumstances, he noted as his eyes drifted to the older mask and its snarling expression and narrowed red glass eyes. <em>Intimidating.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I went to Addie at the leather shop and worked with her to get a pattern made and cut up, they did a beautiful job. All I needed to do was assemble them. And add the vents.&quot; She let her attention drift with his to the carved leather teeth looming on the far end of the table, mocking her with its sneer. Her hand snaked around his waist as she brought her head to rest above his hip, squeezing gently.
&quot;Its really unlikely they&#39;ll ever see any use, but I&#39;m.. Not taking any chances,&quot; she muttered, her grip on him tightened softly, protectively.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Putting the pieces together seemed like such a simple task with the way she described it, if the task alone hadn&#39;t seemed to drain some of her spirit away, only to replace it with trepidation. With how unknown the trip ahead was shoring up to be, he could definitely appreciate the desire to be as thorough as possible, giving her arm a grateful rub for the thought.

&quot;Better to have it than to not,&quot; He agreed. He raised the one in his hand to his face experimentally, squinting through the glass eyes. &quot;Do we wear these like normal masks? What do they <em>do,</em> exactly?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Cha Cha donning Saoirse&#39;s colors, Cha Cha clad in night-dark clothing, Cha Cha bearing one of the fanged masks and stalking into a foul yellow haze as the air around them rang with the sounds of strangled retching and screams slick with burbling blood.
The shudder that ran down her spine finally snapped her from the visions, and she realized he&#39;d asked her a question amidst it all. As she blinked the lingering imagery away she pushed herself to her feet, gently covering his hands with her own as she guided him through the strap attachments to secure the mask properly. At the sight of it on his face her jaw tensed, brow furrowing with effort as she focused to keep the flashing mental imagery at bay.
&quot;They&#39;re gas masks,&quot; she said softly, eyes roaming to each attachment point in an effort to avoid meeting his gaze.
&quot;The ocean is a terror at the best of times and will toss an unprepared crew into the drink without sparing a thought for them. The creatures that lurk in her depths similarly have no regard for your general interest in being alive. Some of them more than others - though thats maybe worth talking to Yarrow directly,&quot; she muttered, a flash of sympathy softening her expression for a moment.
&quot;But the monsters I know best look and talk like we do.&quot; 

When she was confident the mask was attached snugly without reaching the level of being uncomfortable, she set herself to checking the seals and the air flow coming from the aperture over the mouth, her hands flying in practiced movements.
&quot;Her name was Saoirse Bronaugh, originally. She was a privateer for hire that had gotten her hands on a sleek galleon she named Cailleach with the speed to somehow outpace other ships her size, and all the might that came with it. My mother had the heart of an Admiral and led her crew with all the loyalty and charisma befitting one. She was my hero. I wanted to be just like her.&quot;
She felt her pulse thrumming under her skin as she held a hand in front of the respirator to check the air flow, spurred on by a visceral discomfort that she could feel in the pit of her stomach and prickling the nape of her neck.
&quot;We looked away when her morals started to distort, and her attention turned to competing for territory in the southeastern seas. Convinced ourselves that we were looking out for each other - that <em>she</em> was looking out for us. And we didnt ask questions when she stumbled upon a formula for a corrosive gas that would serve as cover for our ambush tactics. By the time she instructed us to enhance our protective gear further according to her extremely specific instructions, we didnt dare.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As she shook away the worst of her imagination, he quietly moved his hands under her guidance, focusing on the straps and way the whole thing clipped on tight to his face. Almost claustrophobically so with the muffle of his breath sucking through the filter. Grimly he again noted both Addie&#39;s craftsmanship and Niamh&#39;s assembly, listening to the mask&#39;s purpose with an unwitting shiver.

Though her mention of the beasts beneath the waves did little to comfort Cha Cha, he merely nodded and hummed gently in understanding as she spoke, hoping the encouraging sounds were enough to help keep being focused on.

<em>The monsters I know best look and talk like we do.</em> Gods, did Cha Cha understand. His frown deepened under the mask as she described her once-hero, brow furrowed deeply at the detailing of her decline from such a lofty, reasonable pedestal. Though his expression was obscured, a hand reached out to give her shoulder a squeeze. &quot;I know what that&#39;s like, losin a hero. To.. who they choose to be.&quot; He murmured gently.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As she blinked away the haze her hand gently came to rest on the back of his head, smoothing his hair back down as she stared vacantly over his shoulder.
&quot;I just wish she hadn&#39;t condemned us all to burn with her. Wish I could take it back. No one deserves to die that way.&quot; 
After a moment the sound of Cha Cha&#39;s voice muffled through the mask stopped ringing in her skull, and she refocused on what he said - and didn&#39;t say. Settling back down into her heels, she dropped the mask back on the table and brought both arms to rest over his shoulders, one hand still idly combing through his hair as she met his gaze with gentle concern.
&quot;You mean your Dad?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Preparation for the worst had a way of rattling everything you didn’t like thinking about free. The least he could do was help her remove the mask as best he could to remove the reminder of the lingering past. His arms moved to settle around her waist, rubbing her back soothingly at her admission and the cost of her past. “I know,” he murmured gently.

At her question he paused for a moment almost out of habit before nodding. The twitch of his lip into a smile was more grim than comforting, but at least for him he’d had more time between now and his past to digest, that distance giving him more of a buffer. It helped that he didn’t have a mask-shaped collective of reminders of that past in front of him as well.

“Aye. My dad was… always a clever man. Friendly, charismatic, helpful around town… He had this way with magic that made it look so easy and fun, and when I took an interest he did what he could to teach me what he knew.” He said, expression twisting almost guiltily as his gaze drifted from hers. His head shook ever so slightly.

“I guess it’s a good thing I was never as good a necromancer as he was. Even <em>he</em> wasn’t good enough to save mom when she got sick though, and he was too proud to admit it. She wanted to be buried, but he brought her back so he could fuckin... He just couldn&#39;t admit he&#39;d lost. Wouldn&#39;t. I swore I’d never forgive him for it.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her expression hid nothing, vaulting from soft sympathy to muted surprise, settling on a pained expression as she searched for the right thing to say.
&quot;People always say that forgiveness is for us, not the person who hurt us but.. I don&#39;t know. Holding onto my anger and hurt has given me the pushes I&#39;ve needed. I think sometimes youre allowed to not grant someone forgiveness.&quot; Her hand lifted to his cheek, thumb brushing softly as she let her gaze drift.
&quot;I&#39;m not great with the verbal part of comfort beyond pledging myself to action, admittedly. You already know you have me in whatever you need to do.

He closed his eyes at her touch, leaning into the tender hand to his cheek.

He opened his eyes again as she continued, pledging support once more to his cause. How far they&#39;ve come from that lazy afternoon with Margret. He gave her a grateful smile, leaning in to rest his forehead against hers. &quot;Thank ya, Niamh.&quot;

He was quiet for just a moment, expression shifting with thought as he sorted through his thoughts on her offers. &quot;I can&#39;t let him keep getting away with it. &#39;n now with ya and everyone with me, I feel like we might actually be able to do somethin meaningful. And considering one of his minions made its way <em>here</em> tryin to do gods know what to me the other day, the sooner the better.&quot;
