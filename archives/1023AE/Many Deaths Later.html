Enough things needed to be in order before the group of idiots could catapult themselves into uncharted waters, and so there were at least a few days of preparation to be had before leaving Fielbarry.

Kelnari was among those who had the least to prepare, which left him in a strange place that felt like floating amid a dull buzz of chaos. He had... <em>so</em> many thoughts bouncing around in his skull, strings plucked from every corner of the emotional spectrum. It had left him a bit dissociative, seeming almost shut down much of the time. How much of that had to do with what lay ahead versus what lay dead and yet undiscovered in a nearby forest was uncertain.

Still in that strange fugue-like fog, he wasn&#39;t particularly sure where he was going until he found himself stepping over the threshold of the Creeping Root Inn. He paused for a moment in the doorway, very much as if trying to remember why he came into a room, before slipping out of the walkway so he wasn&#39;t blocking traffic. An involuntary glance was given towards the bizarre, arachnid-flavored simic hybrid settled comfortably near the door--whose singular eye regarded him in return with a matching lack of facial expression--before Kel politely reined himself in from staring, shuffling towards the bar. He still wasn&#39;t sure why his feet had taken him here, but... maybe getting some good landlocked food in his system would make the voyage ahead easier. Maybe it would delay the occult hunger pains that would inevitably creep in at some point. What kind of food did he even like again? It took him a second to remember as he dazedly slipped onto a barstool. His gaze wandered until it found a menu, skimming over it once. Then again, because he hadn&#39;t actually succeeded in reading anything. Third time was the charm.

It wouldn&#39;t be hard to notice how distracted he was. Enough so that he didn&#39;t seem to take any notice of more familiar faces around him, off in his own little convoluted and tangled mess of a world.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not in compassion or comfort by the man&#39;s presence, but perhaps a notable lack of the cold defensiveness he had shown a tendency towards.

&quot;... Bodyguard?&quot; He echoed after a moment, trying to catch up to what had actually been said. A second longer was taken to sort out which label was meant for Achoris and which was meant for Yarrow. &quot;No one&#39;s my bodyguard.&quot; A beat, before he let out a quiet, tired sigh, his attention abandoning the menu and head tilting slightly to better face Jaska.

&quot;... Have I done something to offend you?&quot; He asked, sounding weary but oddly earnest, the words without any exasperation to them. He could understand Cain or Niamh holding a grudge. Hell, he could understand if he was wearing on Yarrow by now, too. But he had less reasons he could think up for why <em>Jaska</em> would be notably peeved with him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

My loathing is for Achoris. I dislike Yarrow, but I can tolerate him for the most part.

And moreover, why it was being pinned on <em>him</em>. But he looked more mutedly confused than actually offended.

&quot;... If you&#39;re assuming Achoris has dragged you through the mud to me, he hasn&#39;t,&quot; he offered, sounding very much as though he wasn&#39;t entirely sure how to dissuade Jaska&#39;s irritation. &quot;Yarrow said you were &#39;always ornery&#39;, but that&#39;s the only thing anyone&#39;s told me about you.&quot;

He glanced back at the menu, having fully forgotten whatever words he had managed to successfully read a moment ago. &quot;... Achoris and I have some... unexpected things in common. Things I haven&#39;t been able to relate to in anyone else ever before. Things... I consider a burden and a curse, though I don&#39;t think he shares that view. But because of that, it&#39;s... it&#39;s been nice to not feel alone in those things for once.&quot; He paused, staring down at the menu without really seeing anything. &quot;I guess I have been seeking out that comfort from him a lot lately.&quot; Another pause. &quot;I wonder when it&#39;ll start to annoy him.&quot; Not &#39;if&#39;, of course, but &#39;when&#39;. It seemed like he had slipped into murmuring mostly to himself.

It took him a few seconds to draw back into the present, and he blinked twice, before looking back up at Jaska. &quot;... It&#39;s just nice to not feel like the only person in the world who&#39;s experienced something upsetting. I&#39;d. I&#39;d kind of given up on ever thinking I&#39;d get relief from that sort of insanity.&quot; He gave a meek little shrug. &quot;I don&#39;t know why you hate him, but you probably don&#39;t have to paint me in that broad stroke.&quot; Spoken like a halfhearted suggestion from someone who likely already considered it wasted breath.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He didn&#39;t seem particularly interested in Kel&#39;s fatalistic wonderings, nor what he and the aasimar might have in common. &quot;As for having felt like you the only person in the world who&#39;s experienced something upsetting... I would suggest you simply open your eyes and take a look around. The world is full of people who have endured suffering. You are not unique in that.&quot;

Jaska turned to face the bar, folding his arms on it, heels hiked on the bottom rung of the stool. &quot;Imagine for a moment that you are being forced to share the company of someone you don&#39;t know on a trip that may prove dangerous. All you know about this person is that they enjoy the company of people you yourself can&#39;t stand. What would be your reaction? Would you blindly give them the benefit of the doubt, risking your own hide in the process? Or would you distrust them until proven otherwise?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I didn&#39;t mean I felt alone in that I had suffered hardship. I meant an extremely specific kind of hardship, with enough nuance to it that I haven&#39;t met anyone else in the same position in over a century.&quot;

He blinked slowly, whatever defensiveness or fighting spirit he&#39;d had the capacity for a few days ago seemingly bled dry from him now. &quot;I don&#39;t have to imagine that. I&#39;m going onto a long voyage with people who tried to kill me a few nights ago. I&#39;ve spent a very, very, very, <em>very</em> long damn time in a constant effort to earn the trust of everyone around me, and I&#39;m... I don&#39;t have that in me right now. If you don&#39;t trust me, I doubt there&#39;s much I can do to change your mind.&quot; A bit dryly, he added, &quot;Other than point to my track record of having not hurt any of you. And having gone to great lengths to actually help you out and prevent harm from coming to you all. But it turns out that doesn&#39;t count since it wasn&#39;t explicitly requested of me beforehand.&quot;

What would have been sarcasm was just dead on arrival, sounding emotionally beaten down and exhausted and more than a little helpless.

He propped his elbow on the bar to lean his temple against his palm so that he wouldn&#39;t be compelled to just put his head flat on the bar instead, regarding Jaska through those same, exhausted, lidded eyes. &quot;What do you want from me?&quot; He asked emptily.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Just as I&#39;m sure I haven&#39;t earned yours, even though I haven&#39;t tried to kill you or hurt you, or even threaten you, I&#39;ve just expressed distaste for the company you keep, and as Yarrow has so helpfully explained, I am &#39;always ornery.&#39;&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;... Achoris isn&#39;t the only one I&#39;ve... very recently come to find I can relate to in very particular ways.&quot; His words weren&#39;t conspiratorially hushed, but he kept his tone soft enough to comfortably stay between them all the same.

&quot;I have no misconception that it&#39;d make you like me, let alone trust me. But... even when it doesn&#39;t change anything, it&#39;s kind of nice to know there&#39;s at least one other person who can relate to something uniquely awful, I think. Some things, people don&#39;t really understand just by having it explained to them. I don&#39;t know. Helps keep the insanity at bay.&quot;

Not too far away, there was zero indication at all that they were being eavesdropped upon--but Jaska would know better than to think Val was out of earshot, or distracted with her work enough to not be listening. Kel&#39;s words <em>were</em> soft, but Val&#39;s ears were keener. Still, she kept to herself, not so much as even glancing towards the two.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;... Ephialtes has no reason to trust you all. And his influence to the material plane is a bit limited. You made him a pretty promise, but... he&#39;s the sort to put faith in that only when it yields tangible results. He was... surprised, I guess, for a native to suddenly be in the equation, but...&quot; He sighed, slowly rubbing over his forehead.

&quot;... It&#39;s his sworn oath to protect my people. It&#39;s all he cares about. The rest of existence could burn, and as long as the Kalashtar are safe, he&#39;s at peace. So I was the only individual he had any semblance of trust in amid all this. His options are limited in terms of forcing things to be put right from his position, so I guess he did the next best thing he saw as an option, and tried to equip <em>me</em> with an advantage over matters, should you all turn out to be... flakes, I guess. Liars at worst.&quot; He shrugged.

&quot;I believe what I&#39;ve been told, in your group&#39;s intentions and honesty. I have no reason to doubt your motivations. I also did not ask to be armed with any advantage, and... rather wish I hadn&#39;t been. It&#39;s hardly information I <em>should</em> be privy to. But I&#39;m aware of what particular nightmares were drawn to the surface up in Longwatch.&quot;

He didn&#39;t really expect Jaska to be pleased with this knowledge, but he also could have skated by without showing his hand at all, and a part of him hoped that gesture of revealing it would ease any threat that him having the knowledge would otherwise carry. At least a little.

&quot;... I don&#39;t know your life. I don&#39;t really know anything about you, other than the brief, out of context blur shared to me. I don&#39;t know the details around the circumstances your nightmare was born from. But I <em>do</em> know what it&#39;s like to be killed over and over again, by people who... don&#39;t care what it&#39;s doing to you. Who seem to treat it as an exercise in creativity.&quot; A beat. &quot;... I think it&#39;s been looming in the back of my head for a while now, just... how distinctly familiar it all felt.&quot; 

He drew in a deep breath, exhaling wearily, not even really looking at Jaska properly. &quot;... I don&#39;t intend to bring it up again. Let alone use it in any sort of way. I&#39;d prefer to forget it all. But... I guess for whatever miserable recompense it might be worth, I&#39;m... reasonably confident I can actually say I get it.
