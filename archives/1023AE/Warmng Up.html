While the breezes were still chilly and the occasional midnight still left frost on the ground, it was a rather perfect temperature when the sun was shining. And this day was no exception, with only a few scattered clouds to break up that lovely warmth. 

As likely expected by anyone who had read her amendment to the notice board, a girl could be found in the training fields of the guild hall--though she was currently treating it almost like a picnic more than exercise. Perched on the fence, she had a long wooden pole resting against the ground with its opposite end tilted against her shoulder, an arm absentmindedly wrapped around it while she munched on an apple and watched the clouds. 

Brunette hair fell to about the middle of her back, and her eyes were an unnatural hue of a peachy-pink color, like rose quartz. But by far the most prominent features she possessed were the sizeable vulpine ears on her head, the same nut-brown color as her hair, and the delightfully thick tail that swayed lightly down the side of the fence, also brown-furred, but with a cream-colored tip to it. Both the tail, the base of her ears, and even some places in her hair had silvery hairs scattered about the brown; she had yet to blow her winter coat, it seemed, and still retained the slightly paled and much thicker variation.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Compared to some of the other inhabitants of Fielbarry, he was rather nondescript at first glance - loose, dark fabrics that seemed more draped across him than actually worn, mostly-bare feet wrapped in simple white cloth and long hair neatly brushed back and left loose for the time being. What was most distinctive was the odd mask he kept on his belt. It resembled a classical crying jester face one might see in a theater, but with two purple and green horns jutting out from its forehead.

The man&#39;s light blue face seemed to wear a permanent sleepy smile as he walked through town and he approached the training grounds, with a hand raised in a wave to the solitary figure already waiting there. &quot;Hullo there, would this be the trainin&#39; grounds, and you the soul that left the extra invitation on the notice board?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Yeah! And also yes!&quot; She replied brightly, tail immediately and reflexively wagging. She bit off the last worthwhile bites of the fruit, before chucking the core as hard as she could towards the treeline. Lunch for someone else.

Dusting off her hands, she hopped down off the fence. &quot;I wasn&#39;t sure anyone was gonna come--though I suppose I also didn&#39;t really write down any particular time,&quot; she continued after she had swallowed her mouthful. &quot;It&#39;s a little hard practicing fighting without anything to fight, but I <em>did</em> find a really nice apple, so it&#39;s scarcely been a waste of time.

I met him once,&quot; Daarka mused, before returning to her entirely unfazed smile.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to worry about carrying me, though! I&#39;ve always done my scouting work by myself, so I&#39;m used to walking,&quot; she reassured, with so much earnest innocence that it was fairly inconceivable that she was being sarcastic.

That pleasant demeanor didn&#39;t falter--yet there was suddenly a flurry of movement, as the pole the girl had been idly slouching against abruptly swept out in a deliberate, startlingly potent arc that caught Meos behind his knees and had them buckling forward, toppling the man onto his back with his feet knocked clean out from under him. 

Instead of continuing some assault, though, she simply bounced back a few paces, ears sharply trained forward and a light grin on her now fixated features. Not a malicious one, either; just excitement, in an almost childlike way. 

&quot;Beat me up!&quot; She invited enthusiastically. 

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">Meos&#39; passive perception is 12. Daarka&#39;s passive sleight of hand and stealth are both 20. So his saving throw against her knocking him prone was at disadvantage; nice nat 20. He&#39;s prone, but has taken no damage.

Sparring will, for all intents and purposes, work the same as typical combat; however, narratively it is presumed that attacks will rarely, if ever, be drawing blood, and are not designed to truly cause substantial harm. When hit points reach 0, that character is not knocked unconscious nor begins making death saves, but instead is considered subdued, and the spar is concluded; once &quot;combat&quot; ends, all hit points are restored, with only soreness/bruising/etc being narrative.</code></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1097382003134967849 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1097382003134967849><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, April 16, 2023 9:44 PM">9:44 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">Also if Meos is engaging, roll initiative; if it stays just the two of us, this just determines who goes first.</code></span></div></div></div></div></div>

For a split second, she was almost rendered immobile as the blow threatened to stagger her—but whatever momentary wilt there was to her posture just seemed to flow into new momentum. She never fully stopped moving, that energy just redirecting its flow like animated water, and what had almost been a stagger became a duck under Meos’ sword arm, a flurry of sash and tail vanishing out from beneath his reach as she sprinted back directly opposite the direction he had run in, forcing him to completely halt and reverse his own momentum to continue giving chase. And she certainly seemed ready to keep leading one, bounding away from him like she was weightless, only to ultimately twist around and swing yet another rock back at her pursuer.

This latest sprint brought her nearer to their original positions, enough that as she bounded by, she yelled towards Jaska, “You’re just gonna <em>watch?</em>” 

If her breathlessly gleeful tone was anything to go by, it was an invitation.

The child was pursued, and another attempt was made at catching her with that shimmering mimic of his hand as he closed the distance again. &quot;At the very least make sure yer not in the way if you <em>are</em> watching, these pebbles smart something fierce,&quot; he joked, sleepy smile seeming much more energetic as he closed in. That done, however, it was back to that tune he had been humming - low, steady, and relentless.

Older though he might be, he was far from being over the hill, and keeping pace with the fox child was still something he could do for the moment. It was a tag match of attrition, and who knew who would win?

He wore his usual cotton shirt, buttoned up a little more to stave off the chill of whatever shadow he&#39;d crawled from. Loose pants disappeared into calf-high boots, and the shirt and pants both disappeared beneath the thick scarves and belts around his waist.

He leaned against the fence, giving a lackadaisy wiggle of his fingers in greeting. &quot;Good morning, friends.&quot; He chirped, a sly smug grin sleepy on his face. &quot;You&#39;re already fighting? That was quick.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Right as Meos was about to catch up to her, she seemed to falter in her pace just enough to allow it--only to sharply swing her polearm in an attempt to uppercut him on his advance. The swish through the air failed to catch Meos&#39; jaw, but the sound it made as it tried sounded like it would have hurt--which was probably more to do with the continuous momentum she (and consequentially, the weapon) had been snowballing and less to do with any shred of upper body strength, which she... just simply did not seem particularly built for. The result seemed like it would have been soundly effective all the same, though--and naturally, she was gone swiftly on the heels of the attack.

A reasonable distance away from him again, her sprint deviated into a quick cartwheel--which seemed like unnecessary flair at first, but in reality, allowed her to more fluidly grab up another rock. As soon as she was positioned upright again, she sprang up onto the fence encircling the field, tail lashing for balance and achieving it quite gracefully. 

&quot;Hi, Yarrow!!&quot; She shouted over her shoulder as she bounded across the fenceposts. Why was she up there? Hard to say.

&quot;You&#39;re really fast for an old person!!&quot; The pleasant way she called it over her shoulder seemed complimentary, despite the subjective crudeness of her word choice.

Respect for her elders seemed a bit missing, however, as she followed that up by three rapid twists of a slingshot resulting in yet another small rock being launched towards the poor old man&#39;s noggin. Unfortunately, slingshots were mildly chaotic weapons, and the unfortunate positioning of where Meos was in relation to Daarka resulted in the rock missing Meos (fortunately for him) and smashing through Yarrow&#39;s bottle, obliterating it from the neck down (fortunately for Yarrow&#39;s liver). 

<em>That</em> actually had her endless sprinting faltering, eyes widening a little. &quot;Oh shoot! I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;ll buy you a new one!&quot;

It would take Jaska a moment to notice (perhaps even Yarrow) that a shard of the bottle&#39;s glass seemed to have become... stuck. In thin air. Now hovering motionlessly, as if it had become embedded in a slab of invisible matter on its trajectory to, by the looks of it, impale itself into Jaska&#39;s face.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A movement of something--up in the trees, something unlike the flutter of a bird or the skittering of a squirrel. It was a movement more like an arm being forcibly bent in the wrong direction in one sharp snap, the faintest and most unpleasant sound of which managing to reach his ears, subtle though it was.

And then another similar motion. Like the branches of the tree itself was just beginning to writhe to life in a way that could only be described as agonizing. It was still so hard to tell what he was looking at, but the scope of it quickly exceeded the physical dimensions of the small child he had been searching for. Another detail was suddenly discernable; hands. As soon as he identified one, he suddenly noticed a dozen more. The sky had its clouds, but it was still the middle of the day--and yet the boughs of this tree in particular were so resistant to that sunlight...

They weren&#39;t tree branches. There <em>were</em> tree branches, but Yarrow would abruptly realize that what he saw moving and snapping and grasping was no part of the tree. A network of conjoined appendages, all contorted and bearing no cohesive structure, cracked and shuddered and roiled to some unholy semblance of life, all in the span of a few mercilessly short seconds.

There was no time to truly process this, before the light--against all odds--managed to finally catch yet another notable shape at the center of this tormented, tangled mass. It <em>should</em> have been the shape of a child, but it was so, so terribly wrong. As if the skeletal structure of the girl in and of itself had a horrible, contorting anxiety that left it twisted in ways the humanoid mind knew only to interpret as a sign of danger. There was no pale flesh or colorless hair; only the withered, rotting flesh of a corpse. No beady red eyes, but the blackened, hollow sockets where they should have sat--which the fingers of the innumerable, accursed hands all around suddenly fought to sink into like claws, savagely beginning to tear the little body in twain as swiftly as the girl&#39;s visage had appeared. Strands of black rot spread between the pieces of body as they were ripped, more horrid sounds of sickly, wet breath being ripped from little lungs, the crack of brittle bones, the tear of sloughing flesh--even the smell of rot began to reach Yarrow where he stood, a stench of death somehow more potent than anything naturally encountered before--


And then it was gone. And Axa silently crawled up Jaska&#39;s side until she could sit herself in his arms, her face entirely void of emotion. She was dressed in a little knit jacket of her own, hers a pale ivory held together with softly polished wooden buttons.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">Axa&#39;s passive stealth is 22. Yarrow is distinctly left with a feeling like he was not supposed to see what he saw.

No one else sees, hears, or smells anything.</code></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Something was just off enough about the tree to draw his attention back to take a second glance. He&#39;d seen a few monsters before, made his bed with one or two.

This was nothing like that.

His eyes widened as he took in just what the fuck was wrong with that little pocket of reality and like a sensible man, he let out another shocked yell, stumbling backwards a few steps.

And then it was gone, and the only hint that it ever was there was the memory of it seared into his eyes, the hairs on his arms raised and his heart pounding. An arm grabbed the fence to stabilize himself while his free hand rubbed at his eyes to try and free himself from that spectre.

Belatedly he noticed she&#39;d crawled into his arms, the perfect image of a little girl and nothing like what he&#39;d seen, and he sucked in a shakey breath to stabilize himself further.

&quot;... That&#39;s fair.&quot; Was the most he could offer in response to his explanation while staring at her. He couldn&#39;t keep quiet for long though, and a question bubbled up. &quot;What the <em>fuck</em> was that?&quot;

He wasn&#39;t drunk enough for this.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Still, it seems as if he was able to keep pace. There were no hits connecting, but his breathing was steady and he managed to keep his attention on her - at least for now, as the small commotion behind them seemed to crinkle his brow a bit in concern. &quot;Mind tellin&#39; me what those two are getting up to, dear?

Pushing aside the indignity, his grin widened and he sprawled out a little more against the fence post, head leaning back as he regarded Jaska with a tilt.

&quot;Mm, maybe. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve noticed, but I make people <em>work</em> for my money.

The smack was very quickly followed by a left-handed jab towards the fox, intent on getting even a single hit in without resorting to the other tricks he kept up his sleeve. At the very least, he could pretend it was a somewhat more violent game of tag with a new friend(?).

Still, it seems as if he was able to keep pace. There were no hits connecting, but his breathing was steady and he managed to keep his attention on her - at least for now, as the small commotion behind them seemed to crinkle his brow a bit in concern. &quot;Mind tellin&#39; me what those two are getting up to, dear?

With that, though, she heaved a big breath in an effort to catch up on her panting (which was... unnaturally minor, despite her exertion), and turned to follow after him, her pole resting against her shoulder and sling limply hanging from her opposite hand.

His eyes flicked back up to Jaska, and he inhaled a snorty oink before flashing his dagger forward.

The aasimar&#39;s lackadaisical attitude belied a burst of speed anyone who hadn&#39;t seen him at the guild&#39;s first training mission the year before wouldn&#39;t expect from him.

When a creature misses an attack against you with a melee weapon that deals slashing or piercing damage, you can use your reaction to parry the attack. The creature must make a Strength save (DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity). On a failed save, it drops the weapon, which lands at its feet.


If the creature failed its save by 10 or more or rolls a natural 1, you may choose to break the weapon instead, rendering it useless until repaired.


You can not parry legendary or artifact items, and you cannot break very rare, legendary, or artifact items.</div></div></div></div></div><div class=chatlog__embed-thumbnail-container><a class=chatlog__embed-thumbnail-link href=https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/bFdTZ5ZsE0xfDbUCPuLwTehH1F2Nsaf6NOVNkNUgoCo/%3Fwidth%3D150%26height%3D150%26fit%3Dcrop%26quality%3D95%26auto%3Dwebp/https/www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/28176/197/1581111423-63020371.jpeg> <img class=chatlog__embed-thumbnail src=https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/bFdTZ5ZsE0xfDbUCPuLwTehH1F2Nsaf6NOVNkNUgoCo/%3Fwidth%3D150%26height%3D150%26fit%3Dcrop%26quality%3D95%26auto%3Dwebp/https/www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/28176/197/1581111423-63020371.jpeg alt=Thumbnail loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

He sliced at Yarrow&#39;s thigh with that longer blade, drawing a line of blood, and bringing it up defensively between them.

When a creature misses an attack against you with a melee weapon that deals slashing or piercing damage, you can use your reaction to parry the attack. The creature must make a Strength save (DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity). On a failed save, it drops the weapon, which lands at its feet.


If the creature failed its save by 10 or more or rolls a natural 1, you may choose to break the weapon instead, rendering it useless until repaired.


You can not parry legendary or artifact items, and you cannot break very rare, legendary, or artifact items.</div></div></div></div></div><div class=chatlog__embed-thumbnail-container><a class=chatlog__embed-thumbnail-link href=https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/bFdTZ5ZsE0xfDbUCPuLwTehH1F2Nsaf6NOVNkNUgoCo/%3Fwidth%3D150%26height%3D150%26fit%3Dcrop%26quality%3D95%26auto%3Dwebp/https/www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/28176/197/1581111423-63020371.jpeg> <img class=chatlog__embed-thumbnail src=https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/bFdTZ5ZsE0xfDbUCPuLwTehH1F2Nsaf6NOVNkNUgoCo/%3Fwidth%3D150%26height%3D150%26fit%3Dcrop%26quality%3D95%26auto%3Dwebp/https/www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/28176/197/1581111423-63020371.jpeg alt=Thumbnail loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

The notches in the longer blade were indeed revealed as he caught it on the blade of Yarrow&#39;s failed swipe of the dagger, and a quick wrench attempted to wrest it from his grip, but the spikey little nuisance managed to hold on to it. His teeth were bared in an animalistic snarl, his split tail lashing back and forth behind him like an angry cat&#39;s, clearly displeased with the amount he was now bleeding.

He darted back in for a hearty stab and slice of his blades, unflinching and vicious in his intent. This seemed a bit intense for a spar, but both were drawing a good deal of blood.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Yarrow, for all his hooting and hollering, was both <em>rusty</em> and <em>tipsy.</em> Both of Jaska&#39;s blades connected, and both earned a hiss of pain from him. Pain.. a reminder he was still alive. With that look in Jaska&#39;s eyes, he mentally tried to focus better so he could keep it that way. Of course, it&#39;d help if he didn&#39;t open his fuckin mouth.

&quot;I&#39;m even better in bed.~&quot; he purred, knives flashing back in again as he pressed the attack. He was bleeding quite a bit, though that fury-song rang full in his ears now. It almost looked like he <em>liked</em> it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

When a creature misses an attack against you with a melee weapon that deals slashing or piercing damage, you can use your reaction to parry the attack. The creature must make a Strength save (DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity). On a failed save, it drops the weapon, which lands at its feet.


If the creature failed its save by 10 or more or rolls a natural 1, you may choose to break the weapon instead, rendering it useless until repaired.


You can not parry legendary or artifact items, and you cannot break very rare, legendary, or artifact items.</div></div></div></div></div><div class=chatlog__embed-thumbnail-container><a class=chatlog__embed-thumbnail-link href=https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/bFdTZ5ZsE0xfDbUCPuLwTehH1F2Nsaf6NOVNkNUgoCo/%3Fwidth%3D150%26height%3D150%26fit%3Dcrop%26quality%3D95%26auto%3Dwebp/https/www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/28176/197/1581111423-63020371.jpeg> <img class=chatlog__embed-thumbnail src=https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/bFdTZ5ZsE0xfDbUCPuLwTehH1F2Nsaf6NOVNkNUgoCo/%3Fwidth%3D150%26height%3D150%26fit%3Dcrop%26quality%3D95%26auto%3Dwebp/https/www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/28176/197/1581111423-63020371.jpeg alt=Thumbnail loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1098081339003117619 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1098081339003117619><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 18, 2023 8:03 PM">8:03 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__embed><div class=chatlog__embed-color-pill style=background-color:rgba(53,0,53,255)></div><div class=chatlog__embed-content-container><div class=chatlog__embed-content><div class=chatlog__embed-text><div class=chatlog__embed-title><div class="chatlog__markdown chatlog__markdown-preserve">Jaska attacks with a Vice!</div></div><div class=chatlog__embed-fields><div class=chatlog__embed-field><div class=chatlog__embed-field-name><div class="chatlog__markdown chatlog__markdown-preserve">Meta</div></div><div class=chatlog__embed-field-value><div class="chatlog__markdown chatlog__markdown-preserve"><strong>To Hit</strong>: 1d20 (2) + 8 = <code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">10</code>

Jaska was starting to look a bit fucked up, his mood growing even more nasty at the sudden arrival and interference of the foxgirl and the waterboy. 

Because the first thought on his mind was not that this was about to be a fair, balanced fight. He immediately assumed the others were circling around in Yarrow&#39;s defense, particularly since Jaska was the instigator, and in his paranoia, both his slashing attacks on Yarrow managed to miss. He pivoted his stance to try to keep all of them in his line of sight, glancing to each of them sharply and braced for retaliation.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Yarrow glanced over as Daarka yelled his name, cursing under his breath as she bounded in towards Jaska. He stumbled a moment, clumsily dodging Jaska&#39;s daggers, only to get Enhanced Buttpats from a man he just met. (normally he was fine with these things, but it was the <em>principle</em> of things!)

He sputtered out a confused sound, head turning to follow Meos&#39;s intrusion - and then was promptly swept off his feet by Daarka. He hit the ground with a heavy thud, the wind knocked out of his lungs. Adrenaline pumping, he rolled away from them, smoothly transitioning back to his feet in a wide, if somewhat wobbly stance as he tried to get his bearings again.

When a creature misses an attack against you with a melee weapon that deals slashing or piercing damage, you can use your reaction to parry the attack. The creature must make a Strength save (DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity). On a failed save, it drops the weapon, which lands at its feet.


If the creature failed its save by 10 or more or rolls a natural 1, you may choose to break the weapon instead, rendering it useless until repaired.

She didn&#39;t notice the discarded pieces of broken bottle from earlier beginning to subtly levitate as she shifted her position slightly so she was a bit nearer to Jaska&#39;s shoulder, and facing the rest of them along with him. 

&quot;I think he was carving up Yarrow pretty decently! I meant to help, but I think I distracted both of you instead of just Yarrow like I intended. There&#39;s no point in fighting--what, to the death?--over something like this if you don&#39;t have to... it&#39;s kind of weird that you&#39;d be making it sound like the draw was anything other than an extremely good mutual decision.&quot;

She gave a little shrug. &quot;I guess that just doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense to me. What&#39;s the use in staying in a fight, if you could have better chances stepping away, licking your wounds, and then coming back again with a new approach your prey doesn&#39;t even see coming?&quot; She had that same light, friendly smile she&#39;d had before, purely earnest without any sign of any semblance of sarcasm or doublespeak. Which made it just a tiny bit jarring when she cast that warm smile towards Yarrow and continued, &quot;He&#39;ll probably wait until you&#39;ve all but forgotten about this entirely before he tries to stick a knife in you again! You might know it&#39;s coming <em>eventually</em>, but not knowing when <em>exactly</em> puts all the power in his hands.&quot; She turned that warm smile to Jaska then. 

&quot;I think it&#39;s incredibly smart. Playing the long game usually is.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The threat got his attention though, even as jarring as it was with her earnestness that constantly took him off guard.

You must be Meos then, right?&quot;

He shot Piper an odd look. Clearly he didn&#39;t quite agree with the appeal of outdoors over the sounds of people. He wasn&#39;t about to tell her she was wrong for it though. Just think it a little. He chuckled at the mention of boats making her sick.. similarly something he couldn&#39;t agree with, considering his past love for them. &quot;Well I won&#39;t make you get on any boats as long as you promise not to throw up on me, alright?&quot;

Though his question of the state of town straight from the fox&#39;s mouth went unanswered, he quickly forgot the question as he followed Daarka&#39;s gaze to Cain. His brows raised, and he wasn&#39;t shy about looking her over with evident approval.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She wasn&#39;t always ready to describe her vision. It was good enough to land an arrow, given she had enough light and spells could get her by but here she simply saw the bun as part of the definition. 

Clothing that didn&#39;t hug to the skin, she thought, but expression was lost to her unless she closed the gap. 

&quot;I can do that. If it comes to sea travel in any future endeavors I won&#39;t be aiming for anyone, anyway. Over the edge for me.&quot; Notably she would not take this moment to strike at Jaska, remembering the tense set of his shoulders earlier.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The amused quirk to her lips was quickly smoothed out as her taciturn expression returned.

Cain nodded cordially, and gently pushed against the tree she&#39;d been leaning against. Her footsteps were light, landing gently first on the balls of her feet as she joined the group in time to catch the round of introductions occuring.

Addressing the fox-like girl&#39;s question, Cain answered in the affirmative. &quot;Aye, I&#39;m Cain. I&#39;ve only just arrived to town - this mission was fortunately timed.&quot;

She caught Yarrow&#39;s gaze and gave him a coy glance in return, but otherwise seemed content to let him look. She nodded in greeting to each other member of mission.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Seems we&#39;re an odd bunch t&#39; be headed out, but I&#39;m sure things&#39;ll go fine. Assuming the land where we&#39;re going isn&#39;t blighted throughout.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Then he nodded his head towards Daarka, &quot;Seems she&#39;s been where we need t&#39; go, or close, at least. So I was hoping she&#39;d have some thoughts on how t&#39; pack.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
