The turn of the seasons also happened to be when farm production tended to pick up, and everyone and their mother suddenly had enough zucchini to feed the town. Thankfully, Cha Cha had not been on Zucchini duty. Instead, he’d been helping with the fruit harvests and preservation for the winter to the point that he could fill a jar of jam in his sleep. After everything was said and done, he’d earned an impressive collection of jam jars as payment and thanks for his help, which, while appreciated, were far more than he could possibly eat.

With the weather pleasant today, he lugged an impressively sized pack full of goodies and treats (along with a few pies and tarts when jars became scarce) to hand out. He whistled an idle tune as he walked towards town, having already deposited some with Nils and Cas and their parents.

He scratched at his beard in thought, rumbling aloud. “Who do we even give these to?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As they moseyed the tightly packed jars rattled gently against one another, occasionally louder with accompanying frantic scurrying noises as a little tawny gremlin of a creature skittered over the lids and desperately attempted to wrench one of them, any of them, open with his tiny peewee boy strength. Futile as his efforts were against the physics of an air-tight seal, his sheer gumption was enough that both Niamh and the pegasus ambling along behind them kept half an eye on his activities. Nuala, for her part, was not hitched up to a cart or wagon or anything of the sort, she was simply coming along for emotional support. And to occasionally try her luck at the baked goods in Cha Cha&#39;s pack.

&quot;Well, your initial &#39;must deliver&#39; list was pretty short,&quot; she mused,  tugging idly at one of the curls of hair that twisted in front of her ear. The short, choppy bob she had come into town with had been given a year and a half to grow - enough time that the shock of platinum sun-bleached color now tumbled over her shoulders in waves. The fanged grin she flashed up at Cha Cha though was evergreen; &quot;If youve not got a single donation point in mind, we could just pass out what we&#39;ve got whenever we run into familiar faces. Its too nice today to be holed up inside, I&#39;m betting town center won&#39;t be short on people.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She&#39;d stopped for a snack and a bit of post-training reward in form of alcohol discretely acquired from the flask at her hip. Cain&#39;s evening had been quiet, missing the company of a certain bramble oriented individual who was often invited back to her rooms. Returned to her solitary ways, Cain rose early, but not so early that she beat the sun. The crisp air had invigorated her, and she&#39;d spent a few solid hours at the training grounds. After a quick clean up, the progressively more and more beautiful day inspired Cain to meander through the streets of the town she now called home. 

The scent of freshly baked bread lured her to the cafe where she now rested, her rumbling stomach insisting on sustenance. With eager bites, Cain wolfed down a sandwich constructed with still warm sourdough slices. Her eyes flit across the town center as she ate and alternated sips between her flask and a glass of water, taking in the various denizens going about their business. With a grin that verged on cheshire in nature, Cain gave a lazy wave of fingers as she spotted Niamh approach - indeed, the group was hard to miss with Nuala and a rather large bear of a man in tow.

Dusting the remains of her meal off her fingertips, Cain began wandering in their direction. The tall barbarian moved with her usual effortless ease, each movement seeming calculated to bring maximum smoothness and efficiency. Cain bounced on the balls of her feet as she approached, and her long black hair which hung loose swung with her steps. She was dressed in simple but elegant grab that permitted a wide range of motion, her classic greys and blacks, and her short sleeves revealed a well-muscled physique. Her grin remained bright as Cain peered with curiosity at the wagon. &quot;That looks like a losing battle, friend,&quot; Cain quipped good naturedly at the familiar still scrambling at the lids.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Nodding her head towards the side of the main road, she adjusted her grip on the wagon&#39;s handle and reached out to grab Cha Cha&#39;s hand, tugging both out of the way of the rest of the foot traffic. As Cain grinned down at Lil Mans herculean efforts to twist open a lid not meant for tiny clawed paws, Niamh responded with a sigh and a dramatic flourish of her hand.
&quot;He&#39;s been at it since we started loading up this morning, frankly I dont know how hes still conscious. If he manages to get one open I&#39;m honestly inclined to let him have it - he&#39;ll have worked up a genuine appetite to warrant it by then.&quot; The exasperated expression quickly slipped back into a warm grin though as she stepped up beside Cain and squeezed an arm around her with a soft, pleased squeak. &quot;S&#39;good to see you again, I&#39;ve not been at the guild much of late and I feel like I keep missing you whenever I do - Cain this is Cha Cha,&quot; she continued, reaching her free hand to rest on his arm. &quot;Cha Cha, Cain - she was on the Ghalasine mission, the mess with the floating crumbling castle and what have you.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As they came into the heart of the town, the pegasus&#39; head was more on a swivel, though she did not seem anxious in a fearful way; she was simply a prey animal, and still relatively unused to civilization. 

She did seem to have some recognition for Cain, though, who earned a brief probe of her soft muzzle, before the pegasus&#39; head recoiled again with a demure sort of shyness.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There were a few specific individuals in town he wanted to get, but that number was just about as small as his &#39;must deliver&#39; list was. &quot;Not a bad idea... weather&#39;s nice enough for it.&quot;

He perked curiously as Cain waived their way and made her way over, taking in her unfamiliar appearance. Niamh was easily able to grab his hand and maneuver him where she pleased, not minding the stop for conversation. He settled beside her and gave Cain a friendly wave as the pair were introduced, some small recollection crossing his expression at the name, along with Niamh&#39;s explanation. &quot;Nice to meetcha, Cain. Heard good things about ya. Ya did some good, freeing Ghalasine of that mess... I&#39;ve got a few friends who live there. Glad t&#39;know they&#39;re not.. y&#39;know. Weird, what, ashy dust bastards?&quot;

He squinted a moment at trying to remember what he&#39;d heard of that trip before shrugging, offering Cain a meaty hand for a shake. &quot;Ya wouldn&#39;t happen to be interested in a few jars of jam, would ya?&quot; He asked. From the subtle clink in his pack to the shiny collection in the wagon, it was clear that saying yes would likely be doing them a favor.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

With an impish grin, Cain produced a crust she&#39;d saved from her lunch, and tossed it in the little creature&#39;s direction. &quot;Well, it certainly won&#39;t do for him to faint from hunger. He&#39;s obviously starving.&quot; Cain&#39;s tone was dry, and her eyes wrinkled with the joke.

Attention turned her friend, Cain returned the side hug with a squeeze, letting her hand linger on Niamh&#39;s hip. &quot;I&#39;ve missed you as well.&quot; Cain&#39;s tone was soft, honest, lacking some of its usual bluster, but gained its chipper notes back as she continued. &quot;Let&#39;s not miss one another again,&quot; she ended with a wink.

Glancing up to take in Cha Cha&#39;s offered hand, Cain didn&#39;t delay in returning the handshake, her grip firm and concise. &quot;Ah, Ghalasine. I think I&#39;m still shaking ash out of my gear. No offense to your friends, but I&#39;m in no hurry to return. It&#39;s nice, however, to hear my reputation proceeds me. Can&#39;t say it&#39;s often good things, though.&quot; With another quick grin, she nodded to Cha Cha. &quot;Do we have you to thank for this impressive amount of jam?&quot; Cain leaned over the wagon, eagerly surveying the goods.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

One of the jars, jostled by his activity and dislodged from it’s safer seat in the cart, teetered over the edge, plummeting towards the pavement. It would have rang the loud, tell-tale sound of shattered dreams and a grisly mess of jam, but a stray passerby with quick reflexes seemed to have enough of a stroke of do-gooder in them to almost involuntarily dart to grab the falling jar as they saw the approaching catastrophe. 

It was a relatively short young man—man? Probably—with decidedly androgynous features, which very much would have made sense on an elf. But this individual did not have the ears to complete that image, only the simple, rounded ones of a human where they could be glimpsed from within dark hair cut bluntly at his jawline. That hair parted a bit to the side, accentuated near that part with a brief streak of stark white hair, and this styling had it falling over their right eye as they swooped to catch the jar, very nearly losing their grip on a book they had been carrying in the process.

Steadying himself with both jar and book secured, he straightened back to his feet again, blinking almost owlishly at the strangers a moment, before offering a meek smile, reaching to hand the jar back. “Your, ah…”

Almost as soon as he began speaking, he drifted off, realizing he had no worldly idea what kind of animal he was looking at.

“… Your friend dropped this one.” A slender brow cocked ever so slightly as he took in the sight of just how much jam was being dragged around. “… Is there a festival in town right now?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

While not wholly unusual, it was enough for him to realise that he barely recalled where anything or anyone was located - especially the shops he had an interest in on that day. He&#39;d managed to pick up some dried meat sticks as a snack - and happened to be gnawing a particularly tough one as he walked - but was still scratching his head over the hammers, nails and various raw materials he needed when he spotted the gathering gang. In particular, the familiar faces caught his attention.

As always, he was dressed in his signature grey cloak and some light blue shorts with modesty, and his backpack and many-pouched belt to help him carry his things. Nugget, for better or worse, was left asleep in his burrow since she would prove to be little help in today&#39;s shopping trip.

He raised a hand in greeting to the gang, waving as he rummaged in his pack with the other for his chalk and board. &quot;<em>Hello,</em>&quot; he clacked out, in case his gesture wasn&#39;t clear, <em>&quot;Did you come to town to sell things?</em>&quot; While the message was mostly intended for Cha Cha and Niamh, he did what he could to allow Cain and Kelnari to read as well, if they wished to.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ya definitely haven’t gotten to see it on one of its better days. As fer you, Niamh’s been nothin but praises so far, ‘n that works for me.”

Cha Cha looked towards the wagon as Cain mentioned the jam, opening his mouth to respond. The words devolved into a surprised wordless sound as Lil Man freed his quarry, and he started moving to catch the jar, only for a stranger’s quick reflexes to catch it for him. He paused, then stood back up properly to step over and accept the jar. Catching … his? Confused glance at Lil Man earned an exhale of amusement from his nose before he accepted the jar. “Nice catch. Not a festival, but it’s harvest season, and the fields have been busy.”

Spotting Kaskra’s approach, he raised a hand for a wave in greeting, politely waiting for their newest addition to the party to scratch out his words on the board. He gave it a quick read, humming thoughtfully for a moment, hand scratching at his beard again. “Didn’t actually think t’sell em, to tell ya the truth. There’s enough that I was just hopin to hand some out to some folks.”

Giving his backpack a notable jiggle that was just enough to make the additional jars known, and looked between Cain, Kaskra, and the androgynous stranger with a gesture towards the wagon. “Take a look if ya like. Lot of it’s blackberry, raspberry, apple butter, but there’s a few others too. There’s some pickled vegetables as well.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As their group grew in size, Cain gave a friendly wave to each newcomer, taking a moment to squint against the daylight sun in study of Kaskra&#39;s message. Nodding along, Cain began inspecting the fortunately all intact jars. 

&quot;Aye, those were some quick reflexes on your part, surely deserving of your choice of the goods in thanks!&quot; Cain&#39;s statement was directed to the slight human still holding the book, grateful that the small group wasn&#39;t now tasked with keeping Lil Man&#39;s little fingers from getting cut up on a broken jar. She continued, &quot;And if there&#39;s enough, my pantry wouldn&#39;t complain about the addition of some pickled vegetables. Might even grab a bit of blackberry, if you&#39;re keen to lighten your load - that cafe up the way does a mean loaf of sourdough, if anyone hasn&#39;t tried it before.&quot; Cain roused through the jars, looking for the two she&#39;d indicated interest in. 

Amid the small clinking sounds of the jars, Cain spoke again. &quot;I&#39;m Cain, for those I&#39;ve not met. What brings the rest of you out on this fine day?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Loosing the gasp that had caught in her chest in a relieved sigh, she plunged her hand into the gaps between the jars and hauled the little gremlin out by his tail. Lifting him high enough to look him in the eye as he chewed eagerly at the crust Cain had given him, albeit hanging upside down before her, her eyes narrowed as she sucked her teeth irritably.
&quot;I should let Nuala eat you, ya little menace.&quot;
Threats aside, she did not in fact make any move to let the little monster become a crunchy snack, and instead tucked him under her arm as one might so a rolled up newspaper while he continued trying to find ways to shove the entire piece of bread into his mouth.
She turned back to the stranger then, touching her fingers to her temple in an easy salute of thanks.
&quot;Appreciate that, friend. That moght have been messy otherwise.&quot; Her usual grin crept back onto her face as she spotted Kaskra approaching as well, and made a mental note to start putting money on her prophecies before they came true.
&quot;Aye, Cha Cha&#39;s one of them do-gooders who does things and shares them out of his own kindness,&quot; she added with an exaggerated eye roll, but paused long enough to flash him a genuine smile before turning towards the wagon.

The slender man (a distinction upon those being separate words) gave a small, cordial nod in greeting as several of the strangers thanked him.

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t want it painting the pavement; jam will have such a unique way of needlessly making it look like a nasty crime scene. Well.&quot; He paused thoughtfully, eyeing the jars that contained less gory-looking ingredients. &quot;Depending on which one you dash across the cobbles, I suppose.&quot;

His mismatched gaze lifted to return a pleasant, small smile towards the unfamiliar faces. His left eye--easily observed--was a warm honey-gold color, but his right eye, when it peaked out from behind his hair, was a pearly silver. And in the center of his forehead was a simple, elegant rune that appeared almost like a scar in his smooth, otherwise unblemished complexion. &quot;I&#39;m Kelnari. Pleasure to make acquaintances.

&quot;Aye, you&#39;ll find most of town to be of a similar flavor,&quot; she explained, gesturing broadly around them as she stood back up from the wagon and presented a jar to Cain.
&quot;Niamh. Good to meet you as well.&quot; Giving the newcomer a curious once-over, she gestured back to their haul. &quot;Please, by all means take a look,&quot; she added with a grin, before leaning in closer to Kaskra as if to peek into his day&#39;s shopping.

Cain paused in her jar rummage to read over Kaskra&#39;s reply, tapping her fingers on the side of her cheek as she mused, before returning to sorting through the jars again. &quot;I admit, I&#39;ve nothing urgent to address either. Free time feels quite strange, but- Ah! There you are!&quot; The latter statement was directed to the successfully spotted jar of pickled vegetables, which Cain began securely tucking into a small collapsible rucksack of sorts that she&#39;d produced from one of her pockets. Distracted from her earlier thought, Cain didn&#39;t follow up on why something as simple as a day without any plans felt odd.

With a grateful smile, Cain received the second jar from Niamh, casually brushing the other woman&#39;s hand in the transfer process. Her brow furrowed a bit, contemplating the small size of her bag juxtaposed with the frankly oversized jars. She perched on the edge of the wagon, fished some twine out of another pocket, and began weaving a hybrid between a macrame basket nest and… well, something decidedly less innocent, but still quite decorative. With the second jar securely ensconced in artfully twisted twine, Cain finished her creation with a handle long enough for her to hang the entire thing from her shoulder.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Noting Cain&#39;s beginning of a macrame sort of bag for her jars, he gave her a little approving nod before chancing a sneak peek at Kaskra&#39;s board - the mention of &#39;projects&#39; had perked the old bear&#39;s ear. &quot;Lookin to fix up a place?

His expression flattened a little despite the obvious pride he held for his work, and he nodded. &quot;Aye, friend of mine Klara, she&#39;s got some industrial pots and things what for jarring fruits that she lent out for the harvest this year. I was originally helping pick fruit since I&#39;m tall enough to not need a ladder, but...&quot;

He looked away sheepishly, scratching a cheek. There was a certain tiredness to his voice that came from doing repetitive labor. &quot;Accidentally took off a branch on one of the younger striplings tryin to climb the top, so I got put on preserves duty. Been working the pots for what, a week? This is just what I got to keep for my share of the work, but frankly, I dreamed I was a jar of cloudberries last night, so the sooner I get it all off t&#39;someone else, the better.&quot;

Clearing his throat, he looked back to Kaskra&#39;s chalkboard and visibly relaxed some as he agreed to the help. Looking for something different to do, indeed.

He raised a few different varieties carefully, displaying them on one shelf of a forearm.

Cain swapped the previously acquired berry jar out for the strawberry rhubarb. After unscrewing the metal ring of the lid, Cain looked a bit befuddled - the lid seemed to be comprised of be two components. Fishing a knife out of her pockets, Cain used the butt of the hilt to break the seal of the flat lid, which gave a satisfying pop. Knife still in hand, she dipped the blade itself into the jar. The blade looked clean, but was clearly wicked sharp. With great care, Cain slid the small bite of jam off the tip of the knife, grinning a bit as just the tip clicked against the bottom of her front teeth.

The fruity strawberry nature of the jam led the flavor profile, followed closely by the crisp, tart finish of the rhubarb. It was sweet (she was eating jam plain off a knife, after all), but not overly so. The fruit had clearly been picked at the peak of it&#39;s ripeness, and Cain was not one to hide her honest enjoyment of something. 

&quot;Shit, mate, this is delicious.&quot; With a look of simple pleasure on her face, Cain carefully took another small nibble. She licked her lips, already thinking about having a jelly sandwich of some kind for dinner. Eyebrow raised in offer, Cain held the open jar out to the group in case anyone else wanted to taste, keeping a watchful eye on Lil Man&#39;s proximity.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Upon being brought face to face with his most favoritest person, Lil Mans&#39; ears swiveled forward and nose began twitching as he papped his little paws excitedly against Cha Cha&#39;s wrist - and promptly gave a tiny squeal as he went soaring into the air again.
Frowning as they watched his ascent, Niamh pouted. &quot;So unfair that you and Nils get to be the fun parents while I have to actually discipline them so they dont get too chubby to fly,&quot; she grumbled, casting a sidelong glance at Nuala testing her luck with her nose inching closer to the jar held by the dark-haired newcomer. &quot;Ach - <em>tss</em>.&quot;
Nuala, perhaps unsurprisingly, gave a supremely put-upon huff before straightening back up and exiting his personal bubble.
&quot;Sorry for her, she&#39;s just as bad as he is but ten times his size.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But he didn&#39;t jump far, turning to regard the mare with slightly widened eyes--mostly just marveling at her existence at all, and less out of fear.

Nuala seemed to match Kelnari&#39;s expression one to one: blank, expectant, slightly wide-eyed. Surprised to see the other existed in the first place.

But Kelnari recovered a moment later, his lips pulling into a little smile, as he tentatively reached out a hand towards her to allow her to sniff at him in introduction. &quot;No need to apologize. She&#39;s quite lovely. Can&#39;t say I expected to be making the acquaintance of a pegasus... well, ever.&quot;

Nuala had learned a thing or two in her time in civilization. Presently, that manifested as the wisdom of knowing to befriend a person for a better chance at snacks later. So it didn&#39;t take her much longer to overcome her alertness, poking her nose forward to sniff over Kelnari&#39;s hand. Alas, it was quite empty at the moment--but it gave her chin a little scritch.

There was... a bit more to her intrigue with this stranger than just the coveted jam jar. She seemed gingerly curious with his person in general, though not exactly in the same way she sniffed around pockets looking for pemmican. Kelnari held still politely and allowed her to investigate him patiently, though his brow gave the tiniest of furrows the longer she sniffed away at him in a manner she had not done towards anyone else present.

&quot;... She reminds me of a... very large, very exotic dog, in a sense,&quot; he mused absentmindedly.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He looked over to Nuala at the sound of her getting caught trying to pickpocket, realizing belatedly for once it wasn&#39;t him. As Kel and Nuala seemed to introduce themselves he gave a soft smile. Well, if <em>she</em> seemed to like the stranger, he was probably okay in his book too. &quot;Seems like she likes ya.

Both women were taller than him, even, and he not only didn&#39;t have a weapon visibly on him, but his attire was light and comfy and fashionable, and didn&#39;t even have good places to be hiding a surprise knife or the like. The only features of his that were remarkably unusual were the rune on his forehead, and perhaps the traits of heterochromia with the single lock of white hair contrasting against what was otherwise all black. And holding a book and a jam jar to his chest wasn&#39;t very threatening posture, either.
