Namely, preparation of provisions and gear. It felt oddly comforting to the old bear to be preparing for more than just himself this time, even if their transient destination left him feeling a bit less sure-footed than he ever was traversing the woods. Still, travel food kept well, and there were few more skilled at making it than Cha Cha was. He&#39;d spent the better part of his time since that first troubled night collecting meats, fats, nuts, salt, and berries, anything that could be turned into pemmican.

The evening was a calm one in Cha Cha&#39;s room, with the sound of a mortar and pestle shredding dried meat in a rhythmic familiar pattern, occasionally broken up by the sounds of papers surrounding Niamh. Occasionally he glanced up to watch her study the charts, plotting their course to shores unknown. He didn&#39;t like seeing the way this situation wore on her, that toothy grin of hers appearing less lately.

After a while he cleared his throat and set down the pestle, reaching out a broad hand to gently rest on hers. &quot;If ya scowl any more yer gonna get wrinkles on your forehead.&quot; He murmured, offering her a small smile and a huff of a chuckle. &quot;Why don&#39;t we take a break?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The previous 24 hours had been tense to say the least and she was still wound tight after the revelation that Jaska would be staying behind. It felt wrong. But this was productive and a fully effective distraction since it took all of her attention to plot their eventual pathing. The seasonal shift had seen a more rapid onset this year, which meant that the weather theyd need to prepare for would be slightly different and they&#39;d need to track the currents accordingly... That report from last year was in here somewhere, she&#39;d intentionally not brought it to Yarrow&#39; s room earlier. Probably.

It wasnt until she felt Cha Cha&#39;s hand closing over hers that she let slip the vicegrip hold that the next month&#39;s star charts had held over her for the past hour, blinking away the dryness in her eyes as she felt a small smile creep onto her face. Leaning back in the chair, she turned her hand over under his heavy mitt and wove her fingers between his, arching back over the chair&#39;s rails to a series of deep and satisfying cracks.
&quot;At least I&#39;d look as old as my body feels. Sorry, I completely lost track of the hour. What time is it?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

With Cain and Niamh regular guests, there was little need to keep the room shut out of politeness. Especially with the pair sharing his bed at night, a change of pace that Cha Cha was quickly adapting to. He leaned forward again, smile broadening a little. &quot;Hah. Don&#39;t ya be calling yourself old just yet. Sun&#39;s still up for now, just starting to set. Might be a nice time to go for a walk, aye?&quot;

He gave her hand a little squeeze before standing, stretching until a roll of cracks sounded from his back, earning a pleased groan. &quot;I bet if we head to the west side of town, we could catch a nice view of the sunset.&quot;

He tugged on his worn boots, letting his heavy duster hang on the coat rack while it was still warm enough for the northman to walk around outside in a t shirt. Whether it was warm enough for Niamh, though... He scratched at his beard thoughtfully for a moment. &quot;Will ya need a coat? Ya can borrow mine if ya want.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Maybe since the last time she&#39;d spent the might in Nuala&#39;s treehouse. It would be a nice change of pace to slow down and enjoy something. Extra nice to do such things with Cha Cha, she mused, letting the smile creep further across her face as she slowly stretched her legs out from where they&#39;d been folded underneath her. Her head tilted back as he spoke though, nose scrunching with the recognition that she <em>was</em> a bit more of a baby in the cooler weather. But she&#39;d been getting better through sheer stubbornness, force of will, and an investment into cute sweater dresses. Still needed a coat tonight though.
&quot;Mm, aye - those coats I commissioned aren&#39;t quite ready yet. Probably should&#39;ve gotten something with sleeves, in hindsight,&quot; she muttered, slipping off the chair to meet Cha Cha by the door.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He tugged his duster free from the rack and offered it out to her in a way that she could slip into it from his grip. It was definitely too large around the shoulders and likely a little too long in length, but the leather was soft enough from years of use and perhaps more importantly, it was definitely able to keep Niamh warm and toasty in the encroaching chill. &quot;How many coats did ya commission exactly?&quot; He asked almost incredulously. With how old his coat was, one could easily imagine there was a distinctly small number of coats he believed was necessary. 

Thankfully, it wasn&#39;t too cold outside, and the reds bleeding into the sky and the clouds were lovely even within the confines of town, hidden behind buildings. Cha Cha stuffed his hands into his pockets and inhaled a deep satisfying breath of crisp air, immediately grateful they&#39;d shirked duties in favor of a break. Leisurely he began making his way through town, keeping pace with Niamh. He didn&#39;t have a particular destination other than &#39;west,&#39; and was content to enjoy the walk there as well. &quot;Knew getting out here was a good idea, yer lookin better already... Wasn&#39;t Yarrow supposed to help ya with the mapping shite?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Yes this would do very nicely for the evening. She did crack a small grin at Cha Cha&#39;s bewilderment, giving a gently dismissive wave of the coat sleeve that fell past her fingertips.
&quot;Just two - one for me and one for Yarrow. I had a moment of weakness and wanted to treat us to something nice before stepping on that deck as co-captains.&quot; Her smile turned guilty as she followed him through the door.
&quot;I&#39;ve a weakness for bad financial decisions after getting paid.&quot;

The difference in perspective between the walk to get breakfast and coffee with Jaska and this moment now as they stepped onto the streets with their burdens temporarily shucked was palpable. It had been so easy to lose track of how the days had been passing, the lush greens of summer transforming into the vibrant warm shades of autumn that brought the scent of foliage in on the wind. For the first time in a while, Niamh allowed herself to mosey, nodding agreeably as Cha Cha picked up on the change in mood.
&quot;Aye, he was - is, should say. Its a long voyage to chart so I&#39;m taking the first stretch leaving from the coast. Since our resident compass is staying with him, he&#39;s doing his best to map out the back half. Or he&#39;s supposed to be anyway, but I couldn&#39;t blame him if he was also playing hooky.

If it worked for Niamh though, he could endorse a little extra spending. Especially for something like this. A pair of new coats would surely be good for morale, wouldn&#39;t it? Considering everything he&#39;d been hearing up until this point, they would need all the morale they could get. &quot;That so? That don&#39;t sound too bad then. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll look really nice once they&#39;re done.&quot;

He listened as she explained their splitting of the journey, nodding in understanding. Made sense to play to their strengths.. or at least, split the load. &quot;Mm, that&#39;s a decent way to do it. I&#39;m surprised he&#39;s able to work hard at all, to be honest. I thought playing hooky was about all he did.&quot;

He frowned gently at the mention of the tension, tugging a hand free to reach out and rope around her in a comforting side hug. &quot;I think yer doin great, all things considered. Things are definitely gonna be tough, but it ain&#39;t nothin we can&#39;t handle, especially not together. Yer smart, clever, tough.. and the rest of us are at least one of those things.

Getting him to want to be is the tricky part.&quot;
She let herself turn pliable as she felt the weight of his arm curl around her, tucking into his side as she fell into lock step and pursed her lips in feigned protest. Far more telling was the soft pink flush that crept into her cheeks at the praise, and the speed at which her expressioned softened into a grateful smile.
&quot;You&#39;ve put me in a tough spot you know,&quot; she hummed, wiggling momentarily to thread an arm around his waist.
&quot;On the one hand I feel guilty getting you tied up in all this nonsense - especially at this stage when we&#39;re about to go do something potentially really stupid. On the other,&quot; she continued, tilting her head enough to meet his eye with a lopsided smile, &quot;My confidence in this endeavor was never higher than it was when you&#39;d offered to help. It felt doable.&quot; Turning back to watch the horizon, she tucked herself back in.
&quot;So if my math&#39;s right I think thats two trips to Holbrook I owe you now.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He supposed it made sense. Every man had his price. Even the laziest could be made to run given the right motivations.. briefly he wondered what about this particular endeavor had been the prod before deciding he had more important things to think about.

His attention returned to Niamh, glancing towards that soft smile as she spoke, the arm around his waist comfortable. A single brow crept upwards as she began to speak, though the subtle mirth remained in his expression. Though he tried to steel his face, he couldn&#39;t quite hide his amusement and comfort, nor the small pride at the compliment at her vote of confidence even as he willingly put himself in the path of danger for them.

&quot;Ach. Ya don&#39;t owe me anything, Niamh... but I do appreciate it.&quot; He murmured, giving her a little squeeze before looking towards the horizon as well. &quot;I&#39;m here because I want to be. I want to help, and I know y&#39;d all be better off for it.&quot;

That mirth drained from him as his brow furrowed, thinking back. His arm curled just a smidge tighter. &quot;When ya came back from that Manor, all fucked up and hollow eyed... I&#39;ll do everything I can to prevent that from happening ever again. And I sure as hells can&#39;t do that sitting on my fat arse here, waving ya off to sea.

Her own expression fell - guilt, mostly, and some sorrow as she felt the murky memories of the scenes in the mansion threatening to come into clarity, but she brought her head to rest against his shoulder as her thumb gently brushed against his side. For a brief moment she opened her mouth to apologize for bringing that on him that night - but shut it just as quickly as she heard his voice in her head telling her and Cain that he&#39;d rather tough it out with them than let them go it alone. She&#39;d ask the same of him if the roles were reversed.  So the apology died on her tongue, replaced by gratitude as she gently heabutted him.

I got a reputation to uphold. It&#39;s too late fer me to start acting like a bad boy.&quot;

Feeling a smidge of his own guilt, he almost immediately began smoothing it back out to his best attempt at an un-mussed state, or at least what his fingers were capable of. &quot;Ya got a lot of good in ya too, don&#39;t sell yourself short.&quot;

He lingered there for a moment, almost seeming to waffle before something seemed to click for him, a decision made.

&quot;.. although if ya do want to do something for me,&quot; he began, pulling his arms free to tug free his old worn necklace. Gently he looped the large necklace around Niamh&#39;s head to let the wooden totem rest around her neck as it near always did his. The flat totem was simply carved in the shape of a serene gorilla, wood stained dark and richly. &quot;Wear this. It&#39;s supposed to be a good luck charm.

The upholding of his reputation in action. His gentle praise had her standing straight again with a familiar grin on her face as she swept a quick hand through her freshly fluffed locks to mitigate the damage. &quot;Aye, I&#39;m being influenced for the better.&quot;
The toothiness fell away as she felt his hesitation beside her, straightening while she watched wide-eyed as he started to pull his necklace free. She stilled as he looped the old worn cord over her head, gaze flickering over his face as her brows knit gently in bewilderment. &quot;Oh, I can&#39;t--&quot;

It was lighter than she&#39;d expected, cradling it in both hands as though it were made of porcelain. She ran a thumb over the worn, polished wooden surface with a feather-light touch, feeling very suddenly very small swaddled in the well-loved leather coat. Cha Cha was certainly right - though perhaps not in the way he expected. Despite the strife and the tension of their situation and the horrors that chased them, Niamh was indeed feeling exceptionally, blessedly lucky in that moment. Rather than fight the tightness in her throat, she stood quietly and worried at her lower lip for a few moments before drifting softly back into his personal bubble, bringing her forehead to rest against his collar. Couldn&#39;t be accused of getting soft if no one could see her starting to get weepy on the street.
&quot;Aye. But if I&#39;m going to be carrying all the luck, you&#39;re staying on my rotations.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His arms wrapped around her as she drifted back in, keeping her there in a comfortably tight hug. Her stipulation earned a snort of a laugh, a crack or a small grin that even if she couldn&#39;t see was evident enough in his voice. &quot;You&#39;ll have no complaints from me there. I&#39;d rather ya be my captain than Yarrow any day.&quot;

Sighing gently, he twisted his head to watch the sunset, cheek lowered on top of her head fondly while she coralled her emotions. &quot;If it makes it easier to accept, I&#39;ve given it out to Nils and Cass once or twice before too.&quot; He mused gently. She really had carved out such a similar space in his life that his fondness for her matched his lifelong fondness for the other pair of Vikings. Perhaps it&#39;d really started the year before, encapsulated by the half carved mug he&#39;d presented in the winter and re-presented later upon completion.

He hummed for a moment before twisting his head so his lips hovered over her head, some of that mirth crawling back into his murmur that carried an almost conspiratorial air at his own expense. &quot;.. I&#39;m definitely going to need to practice my knots more though. Wouldn&#39;t want to disappoint ya out on the high seas especially with ya claiming my hide.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Turning just enough to peek an eye off into the direction they&#39;d been walking, a smile crept back onto her face as he explained that the totem had traveled with Nils and Cass as well. It got a nod - a gentle one though, to not dislodge where he&#39;d brought his cheek to rest. The significance was not lost on her though and she felt a flush heat her face, honored and humbled by the gesture. Better than she deserved, she mused briefly, her mind drifting to all the old habits that had started to work their way back into her life and mannerisms as the looming voyage grew closer, and the years on a ship she&#39;d left behind suddenly didnt feel very far at all. Just as quickly she pushed the thought from her mind, focusing her attention on remembering what she&#39;d once told Meos about hoping to earn that goodness Cha Cha had shown her. Absentmindedly, her thumb trailed back over the carved gorilla as she began familiarizing herself with the tiny details. Maybe she would help him build up someone&#39;s house when they got back. With a miniature version in the yard for a dog. That&#39;d be nice.

The carpentry daydreams faded quickly as she felt the reverberation of his humming, and the warmth of his breath on her hair. His musings took a moment for her to register, but once she digested his tone her eyes snapped open with a wicked tilt as she bit down on her lip to smother the deluge of filthy responses that flooded her brain. She huffed a laugh into the chest hair that had tickled her cheek and snaked her arms back around his waist, clasping her wrist with one hand while the nails of the other scratched idle lines up the valley of his back. &quot;From what I hear you&#39;re very good with your hands - I expect it won&#39;t take long to get you up to speed. You can show me what you remember when we get back,&quot; she added, her face warm and the grin that had split it broad and fanged once more.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Every laugh was a little victory against the sensation of treading water before the waves in front of them. Plus, he had to admit he enjoyed the sound of her laughter, the lilt of her voice echoing occasionally in his mind. He didn&#39;t mind putting himself at the expense of a joke if he got to hear it again. Nor did he mind the gentle scritch of her nails, the motion earning a pleased hum. Though he&#39;d been somewhat still faced towards the sunset they&#39;d walked out here to view, he gladly resigned himself to fully facing her in their hug without a single ounce of shame for having stopped in the middle of the street.

His smile grew as she complimented his skill and offered to see his progress, flashing that fanged grin he&#39;d been hoping to see. &quot;Aha, <em>there&#39;s</em> that grin. Ya look much better with it than without. Damn near put the sunset to shame.&quot;

He blinked once, then cleared his throat, aware of how close he&#39;d bent in in conspiracy. Speaking of sunsets.. he straightened up a little and looked west, ignoring the dark spreading on his cheeks. &quot;... It is a nice sunset though.&quot; He murmured, determined to enjoy the last rays of light dancing along pinks and purple skies, stars yawning to life in the growing dark.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The percussive rumble of a hum against her hands and chest, the silken drape of night-dark hair. The curve of his mouth and the way his smile touched his eyes - and the deep flush that stained his cheeks as he caught himself. The cheeky grin on her face eased into a lopsided, genuine smile and the soft tilt of her head, stealing a moment to chew thoughtfully on the inside of her cheek while his attention was turned away. No more than a moment though, and she turned to follow his gaze and catch the last half of the setting sun. She&#39;d needed this more than she could have ever guessed. Straightening her posture to match Cha Cha&#39;s, she brought her head to rest under his chin, slipping into position like a puzzle piece. &quot;Aye, it&#39;s stunning. Thank you.

I&#39;m just glad I could be of help to ya.&quot;

His eyes returned to the sky, though his mind was distracted, a want forming that he struggled to name or voice. This was nice, even as the sun finally slipped from view and the warmth it brought faded with it. They&#39;d done what they&#39;d moseyed out here to do, but he wasn&#39;t quite ready to leave just yet. Not without.. something. An attempt.

A small noise rumbled in his throat, and when he spoke up again it was in a cautious but light way. &quot;We should... do this again. Especially before we leave. Would be good to get outside, so we ain&#39;t stuck inside all day up to our ears in prep work.

Much too fast, the idea of having to leave this blissfully peaceful moment wrenching at her heart. When Cha Cha made no move to leave either, she relaxed further into the embrace and let her gaze wander as the stars began to dot the darkening curtain of night. More stolen moments, enabled by the cocoon of warmth she&#39;d made for herself in his coat and arms.

When he spoke she felt his voice as much as she heard it, her cheek still tucked against the column of his throat, and she smiled. Broadly, warmly, and feeling like a dope for it, she nodded softly from under his jaw as she felt the beat of her quickening pulse in her chilled ears.
&quot;I&#39;d really like that Cha Cha. It&#39;ll be a good sanity check. And, uh, getting used to the colder air. For lung health.&quot;
The added excuses were weak, especially compared to the actually reasonable justifications he&#39;d listed, but she hadn&#39;t needed to weigh any benefits beyond getting to have more moments like these.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Though he was decent at steeling his expression to be calm and collected, or at least furrowed in that familiar way, that heart beating in Niamh&#39;s ear was unable to sing any tune but the truth. A truth that was shared by the rest of his subtle mannerisms, the pulse accompanied with a soft exhale through the nose, a relax in tension in his body that seemed to redirect into the arms that held her close with utter relief. Whatever string of want that had coiled itself within him unspooled at her acceptance of the offer and despite himself he couldn&#39;t keep a smile hidden.

Her justifications were met with accepting silence and a subtle nod of his head, similarly careful not to dislodge her from her place while they stayed to instead stargaze. After a few moments, he snorted softly, an inhale filling before he spoke again. His voice remained in that small casual manner with a hint of nostalgia. &quot;When we were younger, we&#39;d get in the sauna, in the middle of winter. Fill it up with steam and get it as hot as we could possibly handle, and then once we&#39;d reached that point we&#39;d all run outside and jump in the snow to cool down. We should build one when we get back. I bet Nils and Cass would love one too, even just as a regular hot house.&quot;

He paused, before adding &quot;I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s good for ya. Probably good fer getting used to the cold once ya run outside... Or worst comes to worst, we just have a nice sauna all to ourselves.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Being flush against him did nothing to stymie the return of the intrusive thoughts that danced behind her eyes though, fuelled by want like hay to a wildfire. He smelled nice again today - he always smelled like a warm stove and wood shavings but there was an herbal saltiness from the food prep as well. And his skin looked so soft - did this man exfoliate? She hadn&#39;t recalled seeing anything like a sugar scrub in the bathroom. What if she kissed him. Actually, no, Cha Cha was a gentleman - he&#39;d want to do things &#39;the right way&#39; probably. She should at least ask first. That hollow at the base of his neck was <em>so tantalizing</em> though did he just suggest building a sauna?

Her eyes fluttered shut for a moment as she tuned back in fully for the last of his train of thought, a pleased hum coming as the first agreement to the suggestion. &quot;Would you believe me if I told you that I&#39;ve actually done something similar before? Cairn and I got drunk at the holiday gift swap last year and roasted ourselves in front of the fireplace before diving into the snow bank. I dont think I&#39;ve ever sobered up so fast.&quot; Her only experience with actual saunas had been observing the general use of them in a couple different spots while she was in Belhaven, but it was more of a specialty thing brought in by northerners than an actual practice there.
&quot;I&#39;ve never used a sauna myself though - what do you do once youre inside?&quot; she asked, mentally beating back the creeping salacious suggestions with a bat.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Or the way he was unable to ignore the vanilla and burbon leather smell from her hair even without his face buried in it like it had been that first night together. Or the gentle ghost of her breath, and the rise and fall of her chest against his. Even without his coat he felt warm, warmer than he usually was on his own at this time of year. At least with her head tucked under his, eyes hidden away from his, he could keep a coherent train of thought. <em>Look at the stars, idjit. Listen to her talk.</em>

He chuckled at the idea of her diving into a snow bank, nodding subtly in familiarity at the notion of it being a sobering moment. “Ya did, did ya? Wish I could’ve seen it. So yer familiar with the idea of it then at least.”

Another thoughtful hum loosened from him at her question, his thumb idly running circles on her shoulderblade. He closed his eyes for a moment, then reopened them to stare back at the stars, eyes briefly flicking towards her unwittingly. “Ah, well.. They’re a bit of a.. a communal thing, aye? Used to go as a family when I was younger, or out with friends later on. Ya just… go inside, hang out, talk, have fun. It’s really hot inside, so ya have a towel to keep ya covered, or wear somethin real simple so the steam can invigorate your skin.”

Why did he bring up saunas? Why did he suggest they should build one together, use one together? Letting himself ramble to drive his thoughts away from the impulsive ones instead seemed to go in a roundabout right back to some decidedly less gentlemanly thoughts. If his cheeks hadn’t been flushed earlier, they certainly were now, and he couldn’t even blame it on the evening’s chill. He swallowed and cleared his throat, offering a quiet “Just an idea, anyways.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Its a great idea. Perfect time of year to have one. And it&#39;ll be good to get those hands working again after a month of ropes,&quot; she added with a flickering grin that quickly faded with exasperation. Whoops. Benign enough but still. Shutting her eyes with a whisper of a grunt, her shoulders drooped as she let her forehead gently bonk onto his shoulder. It annoyed her how easily the casual flirting and praise had rolled off her tongue before, compared to now. Where was the confidence? The swagger? The unwarranted arrogance? Why did the desire for something <em>more</em> slurp the spine out of her body like a cooked noodle. 
Maybe she could convince him they should pick up spaghetti on the way back. She could clear the maps and charts from the table and grab some candles and whiskey from her room too -- or also just be fucking normal, maybe. Frustrated by the warring in her head, she finally pulled back enough to try and meet his gaze, just to be immediately rewarded by the band of bright color that stained his cheeks. The soft smile crept back onto her face as she watched him for a moment, but resolved to cut him a well-deserved break.
&quot;Are you cold? We can head back - sorry, I was enjoying myself. Let me grab us dinner on the way, aye?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But then, he normally wasn&#39;t quite this distracted. A month of ropes was nothing, he could handle it. She&#39;d heard he was good with his hands, but he could show her if she wanted. They were rough from years of work sure, but he could be gentle, he could be soft. <em>Not as soft as her skin though,</em> his brain reminded him helpfully of his errant hand the next morning, or every single time he&#39;d started sneaking little comforting touches to her hands - for her benefit, he&#39;d told himself - just like his arms wrapped tight around her now, chin on her head with barely room to breathe between them was. No no, there wasn&#39;t anything hidden in her words here.

The bonk of her head against his shoulder was enough to drag him out of his thoughts again, eyes pulling from the stars immediately to watch her just in case she needed. Something? Anything. That&#39;s what he was here for, after all. Finally meeting her gaze again, his eyes memorizing the little flecks of color in hers for a moment before he realized she&#39;d asked him a question. &quot;Wh- No, no, I&#39;m fine. I&#39;m built for the cold. I&#39;m actually pretty warm right now.&quot;

Nailed it. He cleared his throat and reluctantly pulled free from their embrace, arms sliding from their place behind her back to linger instead on her arms for a moment. The gap between them felt colder than ice, but he pushed that thought aside as he recollected himself, rubbing at a cheek to will away the flush he could still feel.

Biting back an <em>it&#39;s a date,</em> he instead nodded agreeably. &quot;Aye, dinner sounds nice. Don&#39;t think ya stopped to eat at all once ya sat down with those maps. There&#39;s that.. nice place not too far from here, isn&#39;t there? Could be worth checkin out.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His lips looked so soft in the street lights.

She missed the closeness as soon as it was gone, her arms feeling achingly empty as they returned to being two people walking through town. Stepping back to stand beside him, she threaded her arm into the crook of his elbow and brought the other hand to rest on his forearm. Proper-like, ladylike even. &quot;I was going to suggest pasta and bringing it back to the room but you know? That sounds so much better, we can sit down and <em>not</em> stare at all the shit we have left to do.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Even if her tease came at his expense, he found himself smiling back at her. &quot;Definitely comfortable,&quot; he murmured, even if the loss of that close contact was less than comfortable.

As she threaded her arm around his, his hand snuck back out to rest on hers as they walked, like a proper gentleman. Keeping her hand warm against the chilly evening was the perfect excuse to salvage some of that contact. He chuckled at the mental image of the pair of them back at the table, eating around maps and half-prepped pemmican. No, much better to go out somewhere nice, extend the pleasantness of their temporary abandonment of duties. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t wanna get pasta on yer maps. Or in the pemmican.&quot; He chuckled. &quot;It wouldn&#39;t taste very good a month later.&quot;

While he had suggested a restaurant, in truth he hadn&#39;t actually eaten there before, only passed by. He had his favorite haunts, and most of those were close to the guild hall, or on the way out of town towards Cass and Nils. The streets still held plenty of other people out, the early sunsets hardly a deterrent to people with things to do and people to see. In a way, moving back into the heart of town into the evening crowd was nice, letting the pair blend in. Music filtered from the entrance of the building, a bard&#39;s violin serenading anyone with an ear to listen. If that wasn&#39;t enough, the smells of food and sounds of pleasant chatter followed close behind.

<em>How romantic. It really was a date, wasn&#39;t it?</em> &quot;Come to think of it, I don&#39;t think <em>I&#39;ve</em> eaten recently either. Hard to remember when I&#39;ve been up to my elbows in pemmican.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She tuned in to the music as it drew Cha Cha&#39;s attention, making a mental note to pack her fiddle for the voyage. Somehow they had stumbled their way into... A really pleasant evening. Ideal, even - there was something so normal about walking arm-in-arm and enjoying the ambiance. She&#39;d been out to see the square at night before but sharing it like this was something particularly special. Her expression as he mentioned that he&#39;d also not really eaten that day was sympathetic, but her head bobbed agreeably as she rubbed her hand along his forearm.
&quot;You&#39;ve been more diligent than I have by far - half of all that glaring at the maps is cursing their existence,&quot; she admitted, letting her head droop onto his shoulder.
As they sauntered, her eye caught on one of the seasonal booths that had popped up, and she halted in the street with a little gasp before tugging at Cha Cha&#39;s arm to get closer. Her free hand floated to the dense tassels of a deep cranberry red shawl hung from the front of the awning. Pulling one end higher to expose the details woven into it, the swath of crimson was broken by an intricate knotwork design of creamy white. Her eyes lit up with delight as she looked it over, and with a flourish freed it from the hook it hung from to wrap it around Cha Cha&#39;s shoulders. Her hand never left the curl on his bicep, but the approving expression on her face was accompanied by a slight tightening in her grip and a gentle nibbling on her lower lip as she tugged at the drape of it.
&quot;This is such a nice color on you.&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Thursday, November 30, 2023 9:15 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His head swiveled to her as she gasped, and he easily followed along at her tugging as though the slightest touch were strong enough to maneuver him wherever she pleased. When he finally spotted what she was looking at, he let out a soft sound of understanding, laced with appreciation. His eyes followed along the detailed knotwork, content to admire it until she freed it from the hook and wrapped it around him. He blinked in surprise, looking down at how it really did suit him, a gentle hand dragging along the soft fabric in reverence. &quot;Not too far off from my tattoos.&quot; he agreed, watching her adjust the way it sat and that little nibble, the way her pointy teeth just poked out behind plush lips.

He looked back to the stall, crimson gaze critically eyeballing the remaining shawls on display before settling on a particularly vibrant shawl that reminded him of her eyes. Grabbing it from the hook, he similarly draped it over her shoulders, drowning out the off white and reds of his duster with warm golds. Though he had less of a flourish, he adjusted it with the same care she did.

&quot;There. Now we match.&quot; He nodded, a pleased grin spreading.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Though the color had mostly faded from his cheeks by now, what remained only seemed accentuated by the red of his shawl. Or maybe that little stolen touch had been enough for him to wonder if the rest of her face was just as soft. Maybe he could get away with brushing her hair from her cheek. Or her lips. <em>Focus.</em>

As they resumed their leisurely stroll, he raised his brows. &quot;If yer paying for these, I&#39;m buying us dinner.&quot; He said definitively. Price be damned, it&#39;d be worth it. He could splurge a little, especially if it was for <s>her</s> someone else.

Mentions of the sea perked his interest, mind slipping into a more familiar mindset as he considered it. A free hand scratched his beard while he listened. &quot;I&#39;ve been on a few river boats before, but not the ocean. What&#39;s it like out there? Besides ropes and knots anyway. Water, obviously.&quot; A pause. &quot;How big exactly are the sleeping quarters again?&quot;

Walking through the doorway brought a fresh wave of rich butters and simmering garlics, the bards violin singing in crescendo before ceasing, only to pick back up anew in a new tune. The crowd was too busy focusing on the stage to notice the pair waltz in. Not so busy that a waiter hadn&#39;t found them though, asking a formal <em>&#39;table for two?&#39;</em> before guiding them into the restaurant. The lights were dimmer than the street lights outside, casting a soft honey glow on everything and everyone inside before being followed up with candles flickering on every table. Even while Cha Cha watched where they were going, he stole the occasional glance Niamh&#39;s way to admire that flickering light dancing across her skin and hair.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She gave him a hard enough time for all the ways that he avoided accepting gifts from the people he was actively helping, she wasn&#39;t about to set a bad example by doing the same thing. And all that besides, she was charmed by his stubborn insistence on giving more than he got. She&#39;d find a way to tip the scales later - maybe sneak a fancy triple berry pie into his ice box.

She turned an ear up to him as he asked about the conditions on the sea - and the sleeping situation, which drew a grimace from her. It faded as they were buffeted with the aromas of the restaurant, the striking tones of the song drawing goosebumps to her skin as she marveled at the performer&#39;s range. When they were swept along by the waiter a moment later, she skipped into tight step with Cha Cha as they maneuvered the aisles, and snuck her hand into his to steal a moment of lacing their fingers together. In all the time she&#39;d known him the novelty of the way his hands dwarfed hers had never been lost. Even when they reached their table tucked against the far wall, she stayed tucked in close until they were left with each other, their menus, and the murmured chatter of other diners flanking them. Turning to look up at him she flashed a lopsided smile. &quot;Normally I&#39;d ask to take your coat for you but I&#39;ve already managed that.&quot; 
Giving a last quick squeeze, she loosed her grip on him to slip free of the duster, cradling it gingerly against her chest as she dropped into her seat and laid it gently across the back.
&quot;So, here&#39;s the trouble with the sleeping arrangements - ocean sailing gets turbulent for a myriad of different reasons. Most sleeping quarters are populated by tiered hammocks to save on space and keep people from getting tossed to the floor in rougher waters. They&#39;re a pretty tight fit.&quot; Her brow furrowed at the explanation that was essentially an admission that they wouldn&#39;t be able to maintain the sleeping arrangements they&#39;d adopted - least of all with Cain, if adding a second person into a hammock was too much then three was out of the question. But if they were being a little selfish..
&quot;There are... Captain&#39;s quarters.&quot; She popped her elbow onto the table, propping her chin up on her hand as she ran a finger over her lower lip and thought idly of doing the same to him.
&quot;We likely wouldn&#39;t get to use it every night, and most of the navigation equipment will be living there, but we&#39;d definitely have some claim to it.&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, December 1, 2023 2:07 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He&#39;d suggested the evening, and he&#39;d suggested the fancy expensive restaurant; he could at least pay for that in lieu of cooking like he had been the past few nights.

His fingers curled around hers as her hand slipped into his, giving it a tight but comfortable squeeze that was aware of how strong his grip could be. While he didn&#39;t doubt that her <em>incredibly soft hands</em> could dish back as tight a grip considering her prowess on the battlefield, he was greedily enjoying the gentle touches as much as possible. He gave her a snort and a smile as she mentioned taking his coat, returning the squeeze before reluctantly slipping his fingers free. &quot;Aye. Ya got my coat, one of my shirts.. anything else I should expect to slip away?&quot; He mused as he settled into the chair opposite of hers.

She already had his devotion, if not as a companion on the battlefield then as a friend. Whether he deserved more or not, he told himself he was happy enough with just that.

His smile faded as the hammocks situation got explained, mind immediately drifting to the tangle of arms and legs he&#39;d swiftly grown used to in the night. Though he is reasoned it was entirely logical and understanding, part of the back of his mind loudly mourned those late night touches they&#39;d miss. As much as he enjoyed them, part of him remembered that haunted look that had started the habit in the first place. The mentions of captains quarters earned a raised, curious brow. Unfamiliar as he was with ships, the idea of the space sprung to mind from whatever books he&#39;d read, conjuring an illustration of a grand room - with his hopeful mind constructing and even grander bed that was big enough for the three of them, though expectations shrunk it as he remembered the size of the ship.

He watched her finger gloss over her lip for a moment and felt some of that heat rise back in his cheeks instantly. <em>Oh look, a menu.</em> He dropped his gaze to the menu he picked up, though it glossed over the words at the moment. &quot;So ya and Cain&#39;ll be sleepin alone for the trip then,&quot; he said. He&#39;d be alone too, but his selfish desires weren&#39;t important here. &quot;... Do ya think the sleeping situation in the Captain&#39;s quarters will be more ideal for that? At least if the two of ya can fit together, that&#39;d help ya both out. I know she&#39;s really important to ya.&quot;

He&#39;d seen those glances between the two of them, those little kisses and collarbone nips that were playful and loving with those soft grabby hands freely exploring - <em>ya don&#39;t even know Cain too well, it ain&#39;t polite to include her in your intrusive thoughts, idjit.</em> Of course, he could be hopeful that he&#39;d fit in the bed too, but..  that was just wishful thinking.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, December 1, 2023 4:40 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>Steal all that and more if you&#39;ll have me</em>, she mused idly, wondering how nicely she&#39;d have to ask for him to let her crack that belt off.

The mischevious smirk faded quickly though, refocusing as he asked after her and Cain. She <em>was</em> really important to her, wasn&#39;t she? Yarrow too, though that particular facet seemed to be getting the girls into trouble recently. Her expression turned pensive as she considered what the past couple missions had done to them as a merry band of assholes. Confronting them with a handful of uncomfortable but mostly benign truths in Ezekiel&#39;s game had been the first thing to actually bring them together. Everything that happened in the mansion was just taking that bond and throwing them straight down the volcano&#39;s gullet, skipping the fires entirely. The way they came out from it there was a neediness in their touches on each other, and an unspoken understanding that they&#39;d prop each other up - stronger as a group than as individuals. She loved them dearly and knew they had her loyalty unquestioningly, the chains that bound them together forged from the trials they&#39;d faced and those that were barreling their way.

But this was different, wasnt it? Where trauma and circumstance had thrust their posse together over just a handful of weeks, her relationship with Cha Cha had developed over time. Cultivated, even, for almost exactly a year now. It hadn&#39;t been their first mission together, but the moment the start of her fondness for him had clicked into place was still crystal clear in her mind. She could still smell the dank cavern, feel the air stirred by Nuala&#39;s escape - still heard the clang of an expanding metal wall in her ears and saw his body bent over hers, the bulwark behind the shield. Her fondness for the Holbrookians following that mission was inescapable, having already developed a deep respect for Cassiana on her first mission with the guild and being particularly vulnerable to Nils&#39; playful energy. But Cha Cha? She&#39;d wanted so badly to earn that friendship, to pay back what he&#39;d given up to save them, to impress him even half as much as he&#39;d impressed her. Circumstance may have blessed her with Cain and Yarrow, but this was something she chose for herself.

In the wake of that moment of recognition, she found herself struck by a familiar pang of guilt as she remembered Ezekiel&#39;s game again - he had stolen her opportunity to share those things about herself on her own time, and thrust their group closer together for their troubles. But it did mean that Cain and Yarrow and Jaska were privy to some facts about her life that Cha Cha wasn&#39;t, and it didnt sit well with her. She&#39;d get him caught up - on all that and a warning on the reality of who Saoirse was, god forbid she&#39;d started prowling the eastern seas. She owed him that.

The uproar of laughter from a nearby table snapped her from her thoughts as she sat up straighter and blinked her eyes back into focus. Oh, she was staring at his mouth again. Whoops. 
<em>He asked you bed-related questions. Go back to flirting it&#39;ll make you feel better, dummy.</em>
She hummed thoughtfully and rubbed at her chin, like she hadnt just spent however much time diving deep into her thoughts. &quot;Well.. It&#39;ll depend on what the shifts look like, actually. Jaska wont be joining us which puts us a man down already, but as muscle goes you and Cain are the two primary hands for that - so you&#39;ll be on opposing shifts most of the time we&#39;re out, if not all of it,&quot; she explained, an apologetic look on her face.
&quot;So she&#39;ll be on Yarrow&#39;s shift while we&#39;re sleeping, most likely.&quot; In an attempt to be nonchalant she finally picked up the menu laid before her, watching him curiously over the top of it. &quot;It may just be us most nights.&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, December 1, 2023 10:54 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It made sense, he reasoned distantly, to have the pair of them divvy’d up to split the workload, especially with Jaska not joining them. With how waifish Kelnari was he wasn’t sure he’d be much help on the boat either. <em>Just the two of them.</em> Would they even have a third person to help them out on their shift? <em>Would they even want one?</em>

Niamh’s curious watch was rewarded with that fresh band of red spreading across his face slowly in realtime once again, eyes staring almost blankly at the menu before him. Realizing he had also stopped responding in favor of his racing thoughts, he cleared his throat a few times, eyes flicking towards hers briefly before dipping back to the menu like a shield. “Oh. Well that’s. That’s fine,” He managed calmly.

<em>Try not to look</em> too <em>happy about it.</em> “Mm. Yarrow better take good care of her then. And, if you’re.. If ya still need a big old teddy bear at night, I’m happy to be there for ya. Whatever ya need, I’m there.” Though he was blushing to hell and back, he managed to look up and give her a genuine, determined stare. Even beyond the implications… he was still willing to be there, no matter what. <em>Especially if she wanted a Cha Cha sized body pillow.</em>

He rubbed at his cheek a little, some flicker of doubt still roiling within him. “… Are ya sure? What if I roll over and crush ya from the boat rocking.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was out before she could help it, both lips curled under her teeth as though she could retroactively bite it back, eyes wide with delight and horror. The laughter came soon after like a burst bubble, one hand covering her traitor mouth as the other reached across the table to curl into Cha Cha&#39;s.
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry. That was supposed to be an inside thought.&quot; Her expression was apologetic in spite of the wide grin on her face, cheeks as red as his had been just moments ago. Clearing her throat, she took a moment to let the mirth settle back down before addressing him with an attempt at normal conversation.
&quot;I completely understand if the flat bed on the ocean situation isnt for you - its a very different experience to say the least, and most people adjust quicker to the hammocks. But I&#39;m.. I like the arrangement we&#39;ve fallen into.&quot;

His eyes squinted a little from his own mirth, his free hand reaching over to give hers a squeeze, sandwiching it between his. &quot;Ya just like me for my fat arse,&quot; he grinned back in modest tease.

He let her hand linger between his as the laughs stopped shaking their shoulders, and he sighed himself into comfortable slump in his chair while she reined the conversation back in. He nodded as she spoke, that fond squint still in his eyes even as his grin faded to a soft smile. &quot;I... Do too.

She grinned at the accusation, alighting her elbow on the table as she bit down on her thumb with a saucy wink.

The overt flirting calmed as he settled back into his chair and she leaned forward in hers, forgetting the menu entirely as she started tracing her fingers along the lines of his palms.
&quot;That&#39;s good, it saves me the trouble of needing to come up with an excuse to keep coming over.&quot; The smile on her face was coy, but eased as she propped her cheek into her free hand and looked back at him cautiously.
&quot;At some point I&#39;ll need to get you up to speed on the kind of bullshit to expect while we&#39;re out there - above and below.

While it was still a toss up if he was able to <em>handle</em> flirtatious advances whether in jest or otherwise, the confidence that radiated freely from Niamh now felt right compared to earlier. While he was into her and he was almost confident enough to believe she felt the same, at the end of the day, she was a dear friend a year in the making.

As she traced the many lines on his palms, some scars and some not, his thumbs gently rubbed along the top of her fingers, less worried about getting caught being fond now than he had been minutes earlier. &quot;Ya say that, and now I wonder what sort of excuses ya were gonna cook up.&quot; He mused, though he didn&#39;t press for an answer beyond his own amused smile.

His brow dipped as well and he nodded, fingers curling back around her hand. &quot;Not tonight,&quot; he agreed. &quot;We&#39;re supposed to be relaxing here. We can worry about the rest later. I&#39;ll have some things to catch ya up on as well before we head north, but that can wait.&quot;

He gave her hand a little squeeze before pulling one free to pick up his menu in genuine review. He let out a little disgruntled noise as he glanced at the prices before he pushed the thoughts from his mind. In favor of embracing the evening. &quot;What do ya say we treat ourselves tonight?

&quot;Is it feeding a stereotype if i say yes?&quot; She grinned nonetheless, scanning the options before humming thoughtfully and leaning back in.
&quot;You know, they&#39;ve got a porterhouse steak option thats supposed to feed two - if you dont mind sharing we could grab that and a couple sides and maybe get a full bottle for not having to pay for two full meals?&quot; Her proposal was made in low, conspiratorial tones, and accompanied by a suggestive eyebrow raise. The table was probably narrow enough that a central plate was manageable. Or she could move her chair maybe? Did they provide side plates for the purposes of sharing?

The suggestion to share a steak dinner was an enticing one, brows raising slowly over the brim of his menu the more she talked. Matching her conspiratory tone he leaned in slightly, his own reply similarly lowered. &quot;Not a bad idea. Could get some nice baked potatoes on the side... and onion rings? Can&#39;t go wrong with onion rings.&quot;

Once they&#39;d confirmed the motley of shared food, he straightened up to greet the waiter moving in with practiced timing. He sat back in his chair once the order had been placed with a pleased hum, legs stretching out under the table - and almost immediately bumping into Niamh&#39;s. It didn&#39;t hurt that the table was indeed narrow, designed for a pair, and it also didn&#39;t hurt that the man had thunder thighs. Instinctively he apologized, shifting to sit more properly in his seat... though after a moment, one knee purposefully bumped against hers in a simple gesture. The way his eyes looked away to admire the restaurant innocently gave it a bit of an echo of their dinner conspiracy plans, and perhaps just a bit more boldness regarding stolen touches.

&quot;So... do ya suppose Cain&#39;s coming back tonight? If she is, I wouldn&#39;t want t&#39;stay out too late in case we miss her. If not... I suppose we could take our time heading back.&quot; He asked, his usual responsible habits laced with just a tiny bit of something. He liked Cain, but... he had to admit he also wouldn&#39;t mind it if it was just the two of them.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She could be dignified when the situation called for it.

She didn&#39;t seem phased at the initial collision of knees, having grabbed the smaller dessert menu stashed away in the corner to snoop. At the second though, the only indication that she&#39;d noticed was the flickering glance at his feigned innocence and the creeping smile at one corner of her mouth. Not one to pass on a chance to retaliate, she shifted enough to cross one knee over the other, and hooked the suspended foot behind the crook of his knee with a gentle tug.

She did focus back in at his question though, and gave a thoughtful hum as she considered the possibility.
&quot;Thats a good question actually, when I left she and Yarrow were starting another round of knots class. I&#39;d wager there&#39;s a decent chance that that&#39;s escalated by now, so..

The foot hooking his knee against hers wasn&#39;t helping, but it <em>was</em> nice. He wasn&#39;t complaining, his knee happy enough to remain pressed against hers. It wasn&#39;t a terribly unfamiliar sensation, considering their sleeping arrangements had them bundled up close lest any of them fall off the bed.

His brows raised a moment at the mention of knots class and the chance for escalation.. though it clicked after a moment, cheeks darkening slightly. &quot;-Oh, I see. Um. Good for them.

&quot;Tonight was looking pretty lively, was there anything you wanted to see before heading back?

He hummed at the question, brow furrowing in thought. &quot;It did look nice out. I think I saw some nice teapots, but nothin too particular. Could be worth giving the market a good walk through before we leave though.&quot;

<em>Or they could close the door.</em> &quot;Or.. dependin on how tired you are, we can always just head back. I&#39;m fine with that too.&quot; he nodded, giving an almost cautious agreement.

He paused with a sniff, head twisting to the side as the grilled steak&#39;s heavenly aroma wafted in. The waiter had returned returned with a broad tray, first setting down the plate with the porterhouse steak between the pair, along with individual plates for them both, then followed by their sides and chased with the promising clunk of a bottle of rum. Cha Cha&#39;s stomach gurgled tellingly once again as he inhaled, feasting his eyes. Offering the waiter a polite thanks as he uncorked the bottle and filled the pair&#39;s glasses, he darted a swift hand towards the onion rings  for a quick taste test. And then immediately opened his mouth, exhaling a wheeze at the ring&#39;s heat on his tongue. &quot;&#39;s hot,&quot; He managed after chewing and swallowing what he&#39;d bitten off.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That could be a nice gift for the holidays coming up. But we could always come back another day too - they&#39;re not going anywhere. And big meals make me sleepy sometimes,&quot; she mused. She wasn&#39;t going to object to more wandering around the center of town, but this at least kept both doors open.

She perked up at his reaction to their approaching meal, sitting up a little straighter in her seat as she quickly became very aware of the pang of hunger that came with eating very little that day. As she picked up on Cha Cha jumping the gun on the onion rings, she paused with the one she had grabbed halfway to her mouth and slowly dropped it onto her plate with a nod. &quot;Ah - right. Good looking out.&quot; 
With an idle hum, she turned her attention to the steak instead, and set about carving the filet from the strip steak before splitting both just a bit off-center from the middle. Abandoning the bone on the serving platter, she moved the bigger portions to Cha Cha&#39;s personal plate and the remainder to her own. Satisfied with the distribution, she eased back in her seat and scooped up her glass, holding it aloft for a toast with a curious smile.
&quot;Any requests?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I can&#39;t imagine her getting upset about getting another one though. Only reason I haven&#39;t <em>made</em> her one yet is because wood don&#39;t work for that.&quot;

Cha Cha&#39;s eyes crinkled with some mirth at that, the idea of a wooden teapot both funny and impractical. &quot;Maybe I should get into metalworking, eh?&quot; He mused. His free hand snuck to hers for a moment. &quot;We&#39;ll play it by ear then, see how we feel afterwards. We don&#39;t have to commit to anything right now.&quot; He reassured. They had the whole evening, after all. <em>And the rest of their lives.</em> 

While Niamh divvied out the steak, he set about moving baked potatoes to their plates to join the steaks she divvied as well. Noting the size difference between the steaks, his brow furrowed and mouth opened for a moment before simply huffing with a little shake of his head, giving up the fight. A smile crossed his lips regardless as he thanked her, and made a mental note to feed her more if she showed even a crumb of hungry before the night was out.

Cupping his glass for a moment, he rumbled at the question, a hand scratching his beard. After a moment his smile seemed almost sheepish as he looked back with his glass raised in anticipation. &quot;Is it too corny to cheer for a better future? Despite all our trials and bullshit, we&#39;ve made it this far. We might be in the fires now, but.. I bet we can do something good on the other side.

From what little she knew, the craft was almost as much about power and strength as it was about finesse. Maybe they could pick up the hobby together? Maybe they could convince the cute smith Cha Cha always went to get his hardware from to take them on as apprentices - she&#39;d yet to win on their ongoing bet that she could get the guy to blush. As she caught the movement of Cha Cha&#39;s glass in the corner of her eye though, she tucked the idea away for later.

Her expression softened to a gentle smile as he gave his proposal, nodding in agreement. He made the other side of this mess sound so much closer than it really was. It was nice. <em>She could be good for him. She could be</em> <em><strong>very</strong></em> <em>good</em>.
Her eyes fluttered as she mentally banished the intrusive thoughts dead set on ruining the mood, and brought her glass to his with a gentle clink.

She&#39;d always had a respect for crafts, he&#39;d seen the way she looked at his sculpting, but if they got into it together they could easily help each other out through the bumbling beginnings of learning something new. He might even stick to it with her there. He wondered how hot it got in the forge. She&#39;d probably be fine, used to the southern heat, though he&#39;d likely struggle. <em>Is it wise to blacksmith shirtless?</em>

The clink of their glasses chased away the thought. &quot;To not fuckin dying.&quot; He cheered quiet enough to not disturb the dinner parties around them, knocking back the dark caramel liquor. A soft warmth bloomed in him, settling against the subtle butterflies and warmth that the comforts of the evening had brought thus far.

He found it easy to talk lightly through dinner, as errant thoughts were easily shoved back into the recesses of his mind with a well-timed mouthful of food. While Niamh had been helping wrangle their hodgepodge group for the trip, most of Cha Cha&#39;s preparation had been out on the town, and thankfully given him enough fodder for small talk. <em>Nessie&#39;s goat dropped a Kid this morning, didn&#39;t even know she was pregnant. Oh, they finally caught that guy who&#39;d been leaving trash in the garden at night. Apparently he&#39;d been doing it for years.</em> All the while, even as he assumed the comfortable front of a gentleman, that loosely hooked leg around hers tugged in just a little closer, maintaining that contact throughout their dinner until he&#39;d finally cleaned plate and sat back in his chair with a pleased groan, one hand resting on his belly.

&quot;I know ya said <em>ya</em> sometimes get tired after a big meal, but I think I&#39;m startin to feel it too.&quot; he chuckled.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As they fell into easy chatter throughout the meal she&#39;d been fiercely combating the desire to trail her foot up his thigh - now she was fighting the desire to lie down on the floor and nap, staring combatively at the last two bites of steak left on her plate.
&quot;I was so audacious thinking that dessert would be a possibility. I miss the me I was twenty minutes ago. Who was she? She was so bold.&quot; Propping her elbows up on either side of her plate, she pointed accusatorily at the remains.
&quot;<em>I will not be defeated by you</em>.&quot;

After a preparatory swig of both water and rum and more thinly veiled threats at the meat, she completed her self-set trial and slumped into her seat to pour the last of their bottle between them.
&quot;I&#39;m declaring this a victory now because later I might be too deeply asleep to do so.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

If he&#39;d worried about her not eating enough earlier, those worries had been thoroughly squashed by now. That, and the pleasant buzz he&#39;d accrued from their bottle had mellowed out all of his worries from the day leaving him thoroughly content, and perhaps a bit looser in the tongue than usual. &quot;Aye. I&#39;ll miss her, drowned under a thick steak. We might not even make it to the boat before yer crushed by meat.&quot;

He blinked a few times before clearing his throat in an attempt to corall himself back towards less suggestive teases, gratefully reaching for the topped off rum with a thanks. After a swig, he set the glass down on the table, a finger idly tracing the rim of the glass. &quot;Normally I&#39;d suggest walking it off for a bit, but honestly laying down and hibernating sounds even better. Do ya think ya can even make it back? Ya look more stuffed than Lil Man after a night of snacks.&quot;

He wondered if he was capable enough to carry her back at the moment. It&#39;s not like he&#39;d drop her, no, he&#39;d never allow himself to do that. Having her that close to his face in his arms though... His self restraint was far less restricted at the moment, he noted as his eyes settled on her lips.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her head tilted thoughtfully at his question as she drummed her hands against her stomach, debating the likelihood of getting a piggyback to the guild so she could bury her face in his hair. &quot;Hmm, well?&quot;
With a soft grunt she set about untangling their legs, though whether the seemingly excessive brushing contact was attributable to clumsiness from the booze or salacious behavior (possibly also from the booze) was a toss-up. Both legs slipped over top of Cha Cha&#39;s thighs in an extended stretch that drew a satisfied groan from her, before she relaxed back into her seat and set about swinging her feet idly by his hips.
&quot;Well. I can still feel my legs so thats a strong start,&quot; she mused, toying with the empty bottle on the table before giving it a suspicious glare.

He&#39;d need the extra liquid courage. Or enabler. Both worked.

One of his knees bumped against her legs as it swung out, bumping it further aside before he grunted to a stand. True to his intent earlier while they were walking, he fished out the appropriate coin for their dinner and left it on the table next to the bill. He stretched lightly so as not to disturb the other guests and let out a satisfied groan before pushing his chair in. There thankfully wasn&#39;t any sway in his walk as he moved to Niamh&#39;s side, offering her a hand to stand with a smile. &quot;Shall we head out then?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Folding her hand back into his elbow, she sidled up beside him and grinned at the prompting. &quot;We shall.&quot;

Re-entering the square brought with it the cacophony of the night life, but the liveliness put some bounce back into her gait. The saunter back took an easy pace, pausing to admire some of the various wares as they passed them, until Niamh&#39;s eye caught on a merchant selling row upon row of bottled holiday drinks. Some of the audacity has clearly returned, because the sight of it invoked a greedy little gasp as she pressed herself into his arm further.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At the very least, he was determined to ensure she wouldn&#39;t sway too far or bump into anyone. Ignoring the urge to simply carry her out, he instead wove his way through the restaurant back to the streets.

Despite the slow drop in temperature outside, the rum had settled warmly in Cha Cha&#39;s chest. Between that and his natural comfort with the cold, he was perfectly content to mosey as slow as they liked, even as the night life and bustle around them seemed to draw him back out of that post-dinner slump. The walking didn&#39;t hurt either. He paused as Niamh gasped, head swiveling until he spotted the drinks. He laughed and gently guided the pair over to the stall to peruse the collection, pulling his hand free to pick up a bottle or two.

On one hand, they really didn&#39;t need much more to drink with half a bottle each sloshing around in them. On the other hand, Niamh&#39;s delight was so endearing, Cha Cha almost wanted to buy a bottle of everything for her, the only thing really stopping him at the moment a combination of his general frugality and, frankly, a lack of carrying that much coin on him at any given time. <em>One more bottle or two couldn&#39;t hurt,</em> he decided, perfectly happy to splurge a little more if it made Niamh happy.

&quot;Got some nice mulled wine and ciders... see anything ya like? Could always bring it back to the room with us.&quot; He asked, selecting a particularly promising bottle of brandy that had caught his eye.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Very annoying, that little voice at the back of her skull singing its warnings against risking her friendship with Cha Cha. But hadn&#39;t it had already been risked, technically speaking? This comfortable cadence they were moving at was well beyond the easy friendship they&#39;d established over the past year. Truth be told, that jump had already been made - the night that she and Cain had crawled into his bed. Her grip on his hand tightened just a bit, like a reflexive grounding and reassurance to herself that whatever they were doing, he was there with her in lock-step.

&quot;You know, I&#39;ve never tried eggnog.&quot; She paused for a moment, tumbling a platinum coin across her fingers in idle thought, tantalizing the merchant. When she spoke next, it was in a not-so-hushed whisper.

They&#39;d known each other for a year, but so quickly had their easy habits and comforts changed -<em>escalated</em> that he being a man of habit and comforts found it both thrilling and terrifying. It had been easy enough to ignore his own wants and desires when he slept alone at night and busied himself with his life&#39;s work. Throwing his life wholeheartedly into helping Niamh and Cain was a similar course of action that had settled him into a collection of touch he realized he desperately wanted more of. The booze didn&#39;t help, but it didn&#39;t hurt; he remembered each little stolen touch, the teases, the flirting, all throughout their evening together before. If anything were to happen <em>oh gods he hoped it would</em> it would only be a natural escalation on a feeling they&#39;d been dancing around all evening.

Plus, he reasoned wholeheartedly, if she wasn&#39;t interested, she would tell him. He trusted her to do that.

He shifted slightly to lean just a smidge against her as her grip tightened, since his hand was full at the moment. A small reciprocation, a reassurance. <em>I&#39;m here for ya.</em> Gaze landing on the eggnog, he nodded with a smile. &quot;Aye, but they do fancy shite with it. The egg <em>in</em> the drink&#39;s kinda cooked in a way? &#39;n the stuff on top&#39;s been fluffed up it hardly looks like egg anymore. It&#39;s good, ya should try it.&quot;

He looked between the bottle of eggnog and his burbon, raising his bottle. &quot;If the &#39;nog ain&#39;t already spiked, it goes well with this.&quot; He offered helpfully, the arm held captive carefully digging coin out to pay for his burbon in a way that wouldn&#39;t dislodge her grip.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Well. We should stock up right?&quot; For the voyage? For a night in his room? Who knew.
With a winning smile at the merchant, she tucked the bottle of eggnog under her arm - and then pointed to each bottle that Cha Cha had made a Bear Noise of Interest at, and slid them the platinum that had been burning a hole in her pocket.
Once the collection had been amassed into a small crate, she surveyed the purchase with the hazy satisfaction of someone with half a bottle of rum in them. And then more critically examined her free hand, weighing the consequences of her actions. This was a two-hands crate. But she only had one hand to spare? Reflexively, the hand on Cha Cha&#39; s arm tightened, reluctant to relinquish that point of contact as she made a tiny grunt of distress.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He eyed Niamh&#39;s free hand, feeling the little squeeze around his arm as she grunted against the idea of letting go. <em>He didn&#39;t want her to. He could just carry it for her, couldn&#39;t he?

He had a free hand though, didn&#39;t he? He reached out for the other side of the crate and gave her a reassuring smile, the arm collected in hers giving her a little bump. &quot;Ya got a nice selection here, I&#39;d hate to have to leave any of it behind.&quot; he said smoothly, giving her a moment to collect the other side before shuffling off through the market, eyes glancing over the buildings nearby to try and catch some distant vista of the guild hall for orientation.

&quot;We don&#39;t have any more hands... might be safe to say we&#39;re done shopping for the night out here.&quot; He chuckled, head leaning in against hers for a moment. &quot;How&#39;re ya feeling, still warm enough?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Their differing heights made holding the crate at the handle for her a little precarious, so she instead tucked her arm under the corner to hoist it, looking quite pleased with her haul once more.
At Cha Cha&#39;s suggestion she nodded, having slaked the desire to put their payment from the mansion to work for the day. At his question though, she paused to consider. Truthfully she felt fine - they were out and about and he was a source of heat and now she was helping to carry a heavy thing. And they were already headed back anyway.
&quot;Its definitely starting to get chilly, I&#39;m surprised how fast it cooled off with so many people here.&quot;

He could still handle it, but as Niamh suggested she was noticing the chill, he nodded, a subtle determination on his expression that suggested he intended to do something about that.

A lifetime in Holbrook had taught him caution. The wrong person seeing you could be disastrous depending on where you were. Though shifters didn&#39;t have as bad a rap as tieflings, they certainly weren&#39;t welcomed with open arms either. Fielbarry was different in a palpable way since day one, and the combination of that comfort with the town as well as the comfort of the woman walking beside him made him consider something he would never otherwise have. His arm tugged free from hers momentarily to wrap around her waist instead, tugging her close against his side. Through the course of that singular movement he shifted, growing in bulk as dark fur spread across his body, head distinctly more bearish than human though the shape of his face fur was distinctly similar to his beard, and that streak of grey jutting from where his hairline started was just where she&#39;d remember it.

Those long claws carefully curled around her, mindful not to snag, his body radiating a little more heat than prior to the shift. When he looked to her though, it was with those same red eyes she knew, speaking in that same gruff deep voice that was ever so careful and concerned for someone else&#39;s well-being. &quot;Is this better?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The rest of her was wide eyed with surprise in delight as a small chirp burbled up from her throat, and she buried the side of her face into his chest, setting the bottles within the crate rattling. &quot;Oh my gods.

Though there was that nice layer of soft fur between her face and his skin, he could still feel the way she pressed in to enjoy it. &quot;I am?&quot; He asked in minor confusion, thoroughly sidetracked from the reason he&#39;d shifted for her in the first place.

<em>He might have to shift more often then, if she was going to react this positively.</em> He chuckled after a moment, furry arm around her waist pulling just a little tighter. &quot;Well I&#39;m glad ya like it then.

For the next minute she called on the best of the dancer&#39;s poise, ingrained in her muscle memory from the years spent under her Dad&#39;s tutelage, using it to keep herself mostly upright and walking straight. <em>So cozy</em>. Her loose hand snaked around his fluffy waist, hooking onto his hip as she adjusted for the added layers of fur. The distance left to the guild was decidedly longer than a minute though, and halfway through her booze- fogged brain parsing out the animalic musk scent that had come with the fur coat, she gave a soft <em>oh</em> in surprise as it was gone just as quickly as it came. The suddenly missing mass left her with a split second of her hand and cheek falling and squeezing in on him to close those lost inches. Blinking in surprise that quickly faded, she readjusted her grip to curl around his hipbone and nestled her chin back against him. Still comfy. And she was already here, might as well stay for the last stretch right? She felt she was being very reasonable about her decisions.

The walls of the guild came into view shortly after, and her eyes narrowed as they found themselves confronted by the fucking door. She could be a reasonable person and actually untangle herself to open the door for him, but at this point they&#39;d made an entire night of making every effort to do the goofy thing instead and she wasn&#39;t about to end the trend now. Pausing only long enough to size up the height of the handle, she shifted her weight to bear on one leg and the arm wrapped around Cha Cha&#39;s waist. The leg not burdened by her body weight lifted as she pressed the sole of her boot on the handle and, with a quick twist of her hip and a flick from her toe, unlatched the door. Gently pushing the door open the rest of the way, she puffed up with satisfaction at a simple task well done, if not in a needlessly complicated way.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The arm around her waist hugged tight instinctively to make sure she didn&#39;t fall, only loosening a smidge once he was sure she was stable. But then, once she settled back in close, his arm re-tightened around. You know. Just to be sure, even if there wasn&#39;t any fur obstructing her view anymore. Or the grip of her hand on his hipbone, a sensation he was far more cognizant about than before.

He too squinted at the door to the guild hall as they approached, wondering just how they were going to get in. It reminded him of that first night back from the manor, Niamh and Cain in his arms and the door to the spare room annoyingly <em>though now it was almost a blessing</em> had been shut. Taking just a bit too long to try and solve the door puzzle, he finally noticed Niamh had shifted, blinking as she hiked her foot up to unlatch the door in a feat of flexibility that he wondered if he&#39;d even have been able to replicate it. <em>Very flexible.</em>

&quot;Nice job,&quot; He murmured with some small measure of awe that definitely wasn&#39;t thinking about how lithe she was, using his shoulder to help keep the door open long enough for them to enter and head upstairs. Which of course, led them right to Cha Cha&#39;s door. Also shut. Locked, even. How responsible of past Cha Cha.

With a suffering exhale through his nose, he finally unwound his arm from around Niamh&#39;s waist to relieve her grip on the crate. &quot;Here, I&#39;ll hold this, ya grab my keys and open the door.&quot; He reasoned. <em>They could snuggle back up again once they were inside, surely.</em></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, December 3, 2023 9:28 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her gaze was hazy, but she could still see which pocket held his belongings and which laid flat against his leg. Naturally, she fished around the empty one first, resting her cheek on his shoulder blade as she hummed with the feigned dissatisfaction of finding nothing but leg. <em>Nailed it</em>. 
There only being two pockets where he would keep things limited her ability to tease though, and she fished out the keys after a moment of rifling through the correct pocket.

Then she had the key, and the door opened wide allowing him to thankfully, finally return back home, remembering himself enough to say thanks on the way in. He carefully set the crate down on part of the table that wasn&#39;t covered in maps and pemmican. Ah yes, the fruits of their labors, and the responsibilities they&#39;d taken a walk to avoid. <em>No, not avoid. Take a much needed break,</em> he corrected his thoughts.

Curiosity got the better of him, and he decided to reacquaint himself with the collective bottles Niamh had picked out for them, raising them out to admire one at a time. The burbon was found and set aside. &quot;Ya really got a nice collection going.

As Cha Cha perused the wares though, she flashed him a grin and tugged free the pale bottle of eggnog to set beside his bourbon. &quot;Whatever we dont finish here before setting out, mostly. But of there&#39;s something that caught your eye we can stash it for a return celebration - that brandy you were looking at is in here somewhere.&quot;

Noticing she was still wearing his duster, he pulled free to move behind her to start helping take the coat back. &quot;Let me get that for ya.&quot; He murmured, leaned in perhaps just a little more than necessary to do so. &quot;Did any of these catch yer fancy for tonight, by the way?

&quot;Aye, that was gonna be my pick as well - I&#39;m feeling brave tonight.&quot; <em>But it wouldn&#39;t hurt to be a little more brave, and this might help</em>.

She tugged free one of the knives folded behind her pouch with a practiced swipe - a thin, mean looking stiletto blade that she stuck gently into the cork before striking to sink it further and leveraging it all back out with a satisfying pop. Somewhere in the floaty fog brain feeling something reminded her that Cha Cha probably had an actual bottle opener in his place, and her eyes narrowed briefly at the bottle as she mentally flicked the thought away. Way too late. And she never really got the chance to use this blade anyway. Hesitantly sniffing at the cork, her brow lifted in intrigue before furrowing again suspiciously. Holding the speared cork to her mouth instead, she gave it a little lick - and brightened immediately, turning eagerly to Cha Cha.

He liked her waist, it felt nice and warm and soft under his hand.

He chuckled as she licked the cork, watching her lips briefly before she brightened at the taste, gaze flicking back to her eyes instead. “Aye, that’s about right for a first time. A good weird, I hope?” He asked.

Gently he pawed for the bottle, raising it to his lips for a testing gulp. He hummed contentedly, licking his lips as he nodded in approval. “Not bad, I think I like this one. They got a good recipe.” He offered the bottlel back, settling comfortably against her where they stood. Did he have cups they could use? Yes. Was he going to go grab them tonight? Not a chance.

They&#39;d have to finish the bottle before leaving - maybe even finish it tonight, milk products were such fickle things. Her scheming switched gears as she finally registered his arm around her again, and she drank deep from the bottle as she leaned into him and curled her arm around him in kind. The bottle she held aloft for him to take, but her eyes swam over his features, studying his face. <em>So close.</em>

As well as it could given the source, anyways.

His eyes lidded a little as he realized what she was offering, the corners of his lips raising from their concerned frown. His free hand rested on her arm, thumb rubbing gently for a moment.

&quot;Niamh, ya don&#39;t have to tell me anything ya don&#39;t want to.&quot; He started, pausing for a moment. &quot;But whatever ya do want to tell me, I&#39;m here to listen. Any day, any time. But, if I&#39;m being a bit selfish.. I would like to know.&quot;

Her head tilted as he reciprocated the offer, very quickly turning to intrigue at the chance to learn something new about him. 
She’d always been curious about his name - she learned pretty early on that Cha Cha was a nickname from childhood, and had a few times tried to sound out what it might have derived from. <em>Ilyacha</em>. She liked it. A grin crept across her face, eyes sparkling with excitement like a kid tossed into a pile of holiday presents.
“Ilya,” she murmured, as though tasting it. “I like it. It suits you - Cha Cha suits you too of course, but in a different way.” She knew immediately that she would keep it close to her chest, both out of respect for his decision to not use it in his daily life and a small selfish desire to keep the little kernel of knowledge to herself. Releasing her grip on the table, she pulled her free hand up to mirror the one on his neck, gently running her thumb over where the stubble under his jaw transitioned into smooth skin. Her gaze lidded as it dragged away from his eyes to rest on his lips for a moment, and slowly crept back up.
“Thank you.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The hand on her waist slowly made its way back around, tugging the pair closer together until he could smell the eggnog and rum on her breath. And then that other hand moved to his neck too, sending fresh sparks across his skin. His free hand moved up until the backs of his fingers gently stroked across her cheek.

It seemed almost silly to him that she would thank him, when telling her his name had been a selfish thing. <em>A mutual want, then.</em> &quot;I should be thanking ya instead,&quot; he murmured, head leaning in until their noses brushed. &quot;I know getting outside tonight was my idea, but yer the one who made it worthwhile.&quot;

He could drown in those eyes, the softness of her skin. There was a warmth in his eyes that rarely showed except in private, in the company of family and friends, burning brighter than ever. His hand turned to cup her cheek instead, his thumb greedily sweeping across her cheek in a mirror of hers, taking in the feeling. A want coiled within him anew, head tilting slightly until his lips hovered over hers. &quot;May I?&quot; He whispered.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Somewhere in the rhythm of her pounding heartbeat, something solidified and she buried her hand back in his hair - and froze, for a moment. 
Her head swam but it wasn&#39;t just from the thrill, and she realized with an unexpected spark of clarity that she didnt want to be drunk. Not for this. Nor did she want there to be any doubt from him later - no scapegoat for him to attribute any of this to.
&quot;<em>Wait</em>,&quot; she huffed, shuffling slightly to pull her hand from his neck and lay it on her chest. A soft pulse of golden light beat from her hand, and her gaze snapped back up to meet his - clear and sharp the way he knew her to be. Gently, she moved her hand from her chest to his, trailing back to where it had sat on his neck and cheek.
&quot;There. So you&#39;re never in doubt.&quot;
And with a flash of a grin, she closed the fraction of distance he&#39;d left and kissed him hungrily, pushing up on her toes as she tugged herself closer.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, December 4, 2023 6:03 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He looked down to her hand even as it drew up his chest, then back to her as she spoke so sure of herself with that confident grin.

He met her lips with a rush of relief, eyes fluttering closed instantly. His arm curled all the tighter around her as he too curled in, leaning down so she didn&#39;t have to stretch so much. He was right. Her lips were just as soft and plush as he&#39;d imagined, if not more. The hand on her cheek slid into her hair, nails running across her scalp as gently as he could manage against the desire to pull her ever closer, somehow.

Breaking free just for a split second, he exhaled her name, just to say it, his voice far needier than it&#39;d ever been. He felt weak in her hands and wanted nothing else, pressing in for another desperate kiss.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her eyes snapped open as she dropped back onto her heels, both to breathe and to quell the ache that had started to develop in her feet (damn her for not keeping up with her dance drills). From the lower vantage her gaze roved over him, looking for all the world like she was going to devour him, and she dropped her hand to snake under his shirt and tug at his hip. One step, a stolen kiss, two steps, a second one, as she moved them backwards into the kitchen. Once she felt the countertop against her back she bounced herself up to perch on the very edge of it, tugging him closer with the hand still wrapped behind his neck until he was flush against her, and she was seated at eye level.

He was more than happy to follow along as she moved them backwards into the kitchen, hands pulling free just enough to assist her up onto the counter (without a single ounce of shame in palming her ass to do so.)

He rumbled a contented noise, pressing in to close the gap with both arms wrapping around her back, one diving back under her shirt while the other tenderly stroked her shoulder. He kissed her again, then again, then his lips traveled away from hers down her neck instead, tenderly kissing until he all too quickly reached the high collar of her shirt. Changing direction, those kisses instead trailed along her jawline up to her ear, giving a teasing nip even as his blood pounded.

As soon as she felt the hem of her shirt creeping up her abdomen, she kissed lightly at his cheekbone and pushed back far enough to whip the fabric over her head in a fluid sweep of her arms. In doing so, she also exposed both the sheer tulle bra embroidered with lilies and  the bold, sweeping lines of the tattoo that curved under her bust. A central blue swallow&#39;s wings flexed out, stretching out to either side of her ribs over a bed of creamy gladiolus flowers, the colors still largely vibrant though the line work had started to turn fuzzy with age.

Her back arched as she brought one arm down, wrist alighting on his shoulder as she tucked her fingers under his collar. On her other hand the recently discarded shirt twirled, and though her expression was bright with mischief and mirth, her gaze met his in question - looking for permission.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Tuesday, December 12, 2023 11:21 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That worry and doubt had disappeared the moment she&#39;d sobered up to kiss him. As her shirt was tugged off expertly, his gaze dipped to behold her, inhaling in surprise at the spread of tattoos and the sheerness of her bra that was somehow more attractive than if she&#39;d been without one. Despite having seen the tattoo on her arm, he hadn&#39;t considered she&#39;d have <em>more. Maybe she had even more.</em> His arms had unwound from her back to let her remove her shirt, and after he&#39;d had a moment to admire her body his hands moved back in, running up her sides until his thumbs rubbed the flat of her sternum, coming up just beneath her breasts. &quot;Yer beautiful, Niamh.&quot; He murmured, voice low and heady.

It was the twirl of the shirt that finally drew his attention with a blink, looking first to the shirt then her face. He felt the tug on his shirt coupled with the glint in her eyes, answering with a little grin. In a similar movement he withdrew his hands to remove his shirt, dangling it off to the side before finally letting it fall. He felt oddly bare for a moment, not because of the shirt but because of the necklace no longer around his throat. <em>It had a better place for now,</em> he reasoned, though he wouldn&#39;t think twice if it were removed with the shirt as well. He leaned back in to press another kiss to her lips, then began his trail downwards once again, hands sliding back up her sides reverently. Through lidded eyes he noticed that gnarly scar, gentle in his kisses along it as if to apologize that she had to bear it in the first place, and accepting it all the same.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her stare focused back in on his face as he spoke, suddenly aware of the rise and fall of her chest and the shift of her ribcage under his touch. Of course she put effort into her appearance. She&#39;d been wearing some variety of the barely-there underclothes most of the days since that first night in his bed. Strange, what the strain of trauma could drive someone to do. It was different to hear him speak like that though - maybe partly because she knew he meant it. Could see it on his face. She imagined that her expression looked very similar in this moment.

Her gaze turned hungry as he tugged his shirt off, drifting over the expanse of his chest. The stark reds of his tattoos, the curve of the dark hair that covered him, and the collection of scars scattered over him - in particular the longest one that crossed his torso, briefly granting herself the headspace to wonder where he got it. She refocused when he kissed her though, a lopsided smile spreading back across her face as she leaned back to give him space to roam. She stilled as he paused at the scar on her neck though, the thought of explaining where it came from cleaving through the pleasure like a spike through her mind. As he lingered though, she pushed the idea away, dismissing it as a later problem as she melted into him.
&quot;<em>Caaaareful</em>,&quot; she purred, the word less a warning than it was a promise as she gently dug her nails into his shouder.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, December 4, 2023 10:15 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He glanced up at her little warning, the nails on his shoulder earning a deep pleased grumble and a subtle shift of his muscles as his shoulder lifted into the touch ever so slightly. He turned his head just enough to kiss just above the sheer fabric of her bra, then looked back just to make sure she saw it.

Slowly he stretched back up until his lips hovered over hers once again, this time close enough for them to just barely touch as he spoke. &quot;Do ya want me to be?&quot; He asked even as his expression remained hungry with anticipation. Despite the question his hands finally moved higher from their resting place, palming her breasts and giving them a slow squeeze before dragging them back down her body. When he spoke again, there was a playful growl in the whisper.

She met his gaze unabashedly as he rose to meet her again, a gleam in her eye again as he spoke and an aggressive arch in her back as she pressed herself further into his touch to meet his challenge. Unwise of him to linger so close, she mused, running her tongue over his lip in response to the growling whisper. Dragging her hands away from his shoulders, she brought one up to tuck under his chin as the other trailed down and around the waistband of his pants.
&quot;You keep on the way you have been, <em>Ilya</em>,&quot; she growled, a husky tone in her voice as she kissed gently at the corners of his mouth, &quot;and I&#39;m going to fuck you so hard you manifest a new religion in my name.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His chin easily settled into her other hand, lifting just a smidge. He was certain she could feel the pounding rush of blood from every heartbeat that only raced faster as she growled his name in promise. Had he known she could say it like <em>that,</em> he wished he&#39;d have told her sooner.

In response, his hands slid back up to cup anew, thumbs brushing little circles. He pressed another kiss to her lips, tongue dragging forward along them begging for entry. His hips pressed against her hand in encouragement with a exhale of a whimper, only to bump against the counter she was sitting on. Another reminder they were in the kitchen instead of somewhere more conducive for making good on that threat.

He hummed, smiling as his hands gave one last squeeze before they dragged down once more. This time they moved in tandem, passing over  hips and then down and around her ass. With a swift tug he yanked Niamh up from the counter and fully against him, nothing but her legs wrapped around his waist and his arms around hers that kept her aloft. He shifted his weight back comfortably until he was sure he bore all of it, than began carrying her towards his bedroom so he could drop her on the bed and hover. &quot;I was hoping y&#39;d say that,&quot; he grinned between breaths, nipping her bottom lip.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her fingers hooked under the waistband of his trousers as he pressed into her touch - and the counter as it turned out, an aspect she hadn&#39;t noticed until she&#39;d flicked the top button loose and his roving hands found purchase on her ass to haul her into the air. She laughed as he took on the entirety of her body weight effortlessly, and spent the duration of the walk to the bedroom alternating between trailing gentle kisses down his neck and dragging her tongue back up.

As soon as they hit the mattress she met his gaze again, her expression softening only long enough for her to cup a hand against his jaw when he got close to nibble at her lip, and reciprocated with a single slow kiss. Appreciating the warmth, appreciating the softness. When she pulled back, she only held his gaze for a moment before the grin crept back into her face, hands wandering back to his waistband where she finally got her chance to tug his belt loose with one hand, and with the other slipped it free with a satisfying crack.

It was the gentle cupping on his jaw that stilled him though, just as eagerly returning the slow kiss as he had the more needy ones. He shifted his weight onto one arm so the other could brush her hair from her face, cupping her face in return to lose himself in the tenderness of the that kiss. When his eyes fluttered back open the passion had cooled back more into that adoring look he&#39;d been trying to hide all evening as though he would have been equally content to simply spend all evening with her doing the mundane as they were now. As she tugged his belt free with a grin, an excited shudder ran up his spine, kick-starting the lust once again.

He gave her one more tender kiss before sitting up straight a moment, leaning back on his heels to first admire the view from a far more exciting angle than on cupboards, then to hook both hands under her knees to effortlessly tug her close, firmly planting himself and his arousal between them. Satisfied, he leaned back down over her with one hand, curling down so he could bury his face in her chest again, nose and beard brushing along her skin along with his heavy exhales. His other hand went to work, sliding underneath her back to find whatever clasp that held her bra in place, undoing it with a skill he was quietly grateful he still had.

Dragging his fingers and nails down her spine on the way out, he left the bra where it was, instead continuing to nose and kiss the soft skin, slowly <em>slowly</em> pushing it down and off. Hand creeping back in to cup and massage under the loosened bra from the side, lips and fingers worked together until they met in the middle, thoroughly dislodging the cup from that breast. He dragged his tongue along it with a happy moan before centering again, cupping his lips to flick his tongue against her in a gentle suction and ending in a toying nip. All the while his gaze had slipped from admiring the skin beneath him back to her face, expression hungry for her.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The hands hooked under her knees tore her from her thoughts though, and she inhaled sharply with a wide-eyed grin as she felt the slide of the sheets beneath her, and the warmth and pressure of him sidled between her legs. The tickle of his lips and beard against her chest came as a secondary revelation to realizing the full size of him as she&#39;d started rocking her hips along his length. She huffed a bewildered, delighted laugh before hooking one ankle around the back of his thigh and wrapping the other leg around his lower back to give herself the leverage to grind against him from base to tip.

She lifted herself compliantly up from the mattress at his touch, one hand twisting into the sheets above her and the other curled around the back of his head as she gently dragged her nails along. The press of his fingers and the touch of his lips on her chest elicited a soft moan from her - one that escalated into a breathy gasp at the feel of his tongue, and the rhythm of her hips adjusted pace to match the jolts of pleasure that came from each brushing pass. The grin crept back into her face at his teasing nipping, and she turned her gaze back to meet his before letting it dart over the rest of his face voraciously. Her grip in his hair tightened as she eased the grinding for just long enough to nudge her boots loose and kick them back across the room, pulling herself back against him with a squeeze of her thighs and a smug smile.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He shuddered out a groan, the hand supporting his weight clawing the bedsheets in an iron grip. His hair spilled into his vision, tousled from movement and her nails along his scalp. Every motion set fire through his body, every glance a spark to set it further ablaze. 

He exhaled hard when she slowed down to kick off her boots, vaguely remembering he was still wearing his. It really <em>had</em> been a long time for him, he realized, burying his face against her chest for a breath before pushing himself up again so he could remove his boots as well. Where they went flying, he didn&#39;t care. He dragged one hand through his hair to peel it back from his face, meeting that smug smile with a determined but quite unprepared smirk. &quot;Ya might be the death of me.&quot; He admitted through a desperate growl, answering the squeeze  of her thighs with a roll of his hips. Not like he minded. He paused to close his eyes for just a moment, taking a deep steadying breath. He wanted this to last, and he&#39;d be damned if he didn&#39;t put in a good effort. A hand reached down to spread fingers along her stomach, trailing down until it met the hem of her pants, fingers curling to teasingly pull them down far enough to grab her hips unhindered to still them, grinding back slowly against her a few times. He let out a huff, slowing after a moment. &quot;Help me take these off?&quot; He asked, withdrawing his hands to hook his thumbs in his own hem.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Only if you ask nicely.&quot; Sex hair was a good look on him, she decided, rewarding the reciprocated grinding with a throaty groan as she used her grip on his waist to leverage her hips into whichever position he wanted.

At the invitation though, the hungry expression that sparked in response spread across her face like wildfire. Curling up to a seated position on the bed and then to her feet in a single, fluid motion, she buried her face in his neck and her hands under the waistband of his pants and drove them into the wall. She took her time after that, tracing the grooves of his hips as she planted delicate kisses and nips down his neck, chest, abdomen, inching the fabric lower as she went. By the time she hit her knees, the last of his clothing hit the floor in a heap. She paused only for a moment to marvel, exhaling briefly with an impressed expression.

As Niamh moved to stand he slid off the bed as well, both hating the loss of contact and quietly delighted at her eagerness. He craned his head to the side as she buried her face in close, his arms moving to curl around her back once again even as she moved them back to the wall. Though he&#39;d collected himself, those hands on his hips were winding that pressure in his core again. As she moved down his chest, his head tilted back with a shaky inhale, eyes closing as he focused on those maddening little touches, intimately aware of each inch of fabric she took with her. Perhaps unsurprisingly, his legs bore plenty of new scars to take in, along with more large bands of red tattoos curving around his upper thighs and calves, more delicate knotwork on display just for her.

He opened his eyes and looked back down, feeling himself stiffen under her gaze. Stepping out of his pants the rest of the way, his breath lodged briefly in his throat as her tongue ran across him. A desperately low moan escaped him and his hands settled into her hair, nails raking gently with want. &quot;Fuck me,&quot; He breathed, curling a little to reach her better. <em>&quot;Please.&quot;</em> He wasn&#39;t too proud to beg, he quickly decided, the word a needy croon.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She paused at his plea, the flash of something wild in her eye before she returned to doting on him, the grin on her face fanged. &quot;<em>Patience</em>,&quot; she purred, sitting up straighter as his hands dove into her hair. &quot;Its rude not to say hello.&quot;
The hand that had been gently tracing along the woven bands of his tattoos shifted to palm his hip, her thumb pressing into the bone under the curve of muscle to pin him to the wall. The other hand shifted its grip to pull him into her mouth, the happy hum that rumbled up from her throat resonating against him as she sealed her lips around him and went to work.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He twitched under her grip, and he was certain she could feel the pulse pounding in his veins. As her hum rumbled along his length, he bit his lip in an attempt to still the need to thrust back to little twitches, the smallest motions moving in tandem as she began building a rhythm. She was rewarded with a mess of little whimpers here and there as her tongue curled one way, or the drag of her hand thumbed lines. Unable to pry his eyes from her, he felt that well of tension building in his groin and spreading warmth throughout his body with shuddering tingles. Eventually he couldn&#39;t help himself, hips rocking against the hand that sought to keep him pinned. The warmth and wetness of her mouth enticed him, pre-anticipation spilling in warning.

&quot;Niamh,&quot; He breathed a needy warning, swallowing hard. The hands in her hair tangled tight, even as he fought to keep himself from drawing his nails too harsh through those silken locks. &quot;If ya keep going, I&#39;m...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sitting back on her heels for a moment she peppered him with kisses, eventually working her way back up the way she came until she stood before him again. 
She brought one hand to rest on his, hesitating only to swipe her thumb across her lip to clean it of any lingering mess. Like a fuckin lady. Satisfied with that, she tugged his hands to the shining buttons on her waist before rising onto her toes to brush her lips and nose ever so gently against his, her chest pressed against him as she brought her elbows to rest on his shoulders and tangled her hands in his hair. When she spoke it was breathy and heady, more of a demand than a request.

He unwound his hands from her hair and brushed it back delicately, unable to keep the dumb grin off his lips. He bent down to meet her as she stretched, nose rubbing gently against hers. A spike of excitement jolted through him anew as his hands were guided to the buttons of her pants, fingers slowly beginning to work them free. &quot;As you wish,&quot; he purred.

He gave her a kiss and a hand pulling free to guide her, spinning them until she was the one with her back to the wall. Then his lips pulled free, beginning the familiar trail down her body with kisses and playful bites, pausing only to attend to her other breast he&#39;d abandoned earlier before continuing his descent. One button, then another, and then he tugged her pants loose, hooking sizeable thumbs into the hem to slowly drag everything down. First off her hips, then down her legs until she too was bare and he was kneeling. He nosed the soft spot between leg and groin,  dragging his tongue up to her hip before kissing back down once again with a pleased whine. His hands trailed all the while back up her legs with one hand curling around to grope her ass in a firm squeeze while the other stretched along her hip, sprawling out to claim it as his own. He glanced up with those same heavy eyes from earlier bright red in the light, lightly dragging his nose between her legs before his tongue followed suite in a wide flat drag that flicked lightly at the end.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At the tugging of her pants she wiggled lightly to assist, ultimately tossing the bundle somewhere across the room with a sweeping kick and bringing the leg to rest hooked over his shoulder. She moaned softly as his hands and mouth roved over her legs and hips, meeting his gaze with a mischevous smile that melted at the sight of those bright heavy-lidded eyes, and turned into a reflection of the adoration she&#39;d seen on his face all evening. At the pressure between her legs though, she moaned softly - followed abruptly by her hips bucking in response to the flicking of his tongue, eliciting a look of surprise from her as she blinked owlishly down at him for a moment.
&quot;Oh..&quot; 
The surprise faded back into the voracious expression just as quickly as it arrived and she twined her hand back into his hair, shuddering lightly under the touch of his tongue.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, December 6, 2023 8:32 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The hand on her ass gave it another squeeze before pulling free to hook around the leg on his shoulder to support it, while the other swept soothing strokes against her hip before pinning her under his large paw.

He pressed a kiss between her legs with a chuckle, letting the sound carry against her skin before he shifted lower, the hand on her hip sliding down to brush a thumb along her entrance, teasingly spreading it enough for him to delve his tongue in deep. A pleased rumble reverberated through him, tongue curling high inside on his way out, once, twice, <em>thrice,</em> before dragging over her clit to circle. Lips encircling it to lightly suck while his tongue stroked, his thumb dragged another line down her lips before sliding just inside in a teasing test, gauging her comfort and reactions. Those fingers were large, after all.

When his attentions shifted back to her clit he got a very similar reaction to the first touch, this time accompanied by a hitch in her breathing and a guttural laugh. As he carried on though the noise melted into a groan, the bucking of her hips settling into staccato shudders in time with each passing stroke of his tongue.
As he ran his thumb along the slick mess she&#39;d become, pausing for permission like a polite houseguest, she let buckle the leg supporting her weight and slid down the wall a few inches, pushing herself onto his hand in the process. The soft groaning broke into panting moans as a tremor ran up her spine, and her stare on him was molten as she fixed him with a pleading look.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Once he was sure she still had some strength in her other leg his hand moved until it squeezed across her ass, fingers digging into the rear of her opposite hip in a stabilizing grip. The perfect seat if she needed it, pressing her firmly against his face.

He grinned as she looked down at him with that desperate stare, lips popping free for a breath of air, tongue licking his lips idly before he dove in again, tongue thrusting along with the finger to drag upwards again and resume his merciless kisses and moans, purposefully muffling his own needy noises against her body. At least one of them sounded like her name, worshipful and desperate as well. His finger curled with each thrust, aiming for that sweet spot with building speed while another finger toyed with the idea of joining it, sliding across her body in rhythm.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Each kiss and groan and swipe of his tongue had her chest pulsing off the wall, the furrowed expression on her face growing increasingly desperate even as her eyes never left his face. The curve of his lips, the mess of fine hairs along his crown not combed away by her needy grip.

It didn&#39;t take long for her pace to fall off, broken by shuddering tremors that ran up her body as she finally curled over with a gasp, the hand in his hair trembling as she felt the mounting sensation begin to crest.

There was no chance he&#39;d let her go though, not when she was like this, not when every blink was met with a brand new favorite view of her. Especially not as the fingers began trembling in his hair, sparks alighting in his eyes.

Her shudders and begging were met with another long drag from his tongue until it pulled free, just for a moment for him to suck in a gasp of air. Even then, his lips still pressed close, so the tremble in his jaw was never far. &quot;Please?&quot; He repeated, pressing another kiss into the crook of her leg and groin before dragging his tongue back in to keep going, exhaling through his nose in an encouraging growl that rumbled in his throat.

The addition of the second finger set sparks flying behind her eyes, not a single coherent thought buzzing through her mind as she felt that rising wave crash on the rhythm of his stroking fingers. Her breath caught with a shuddering gasp, just to loose again with a thunderous cry as her hips began spasming and her spine went ramrod straight against the wall, eyes bright and wide and every muscle in her abdomen taught as she bucked against his touch and rode it out.

When the spasms quieted to little shudders, she finally let herself slide to the floor as the tension ebbed from her body.

He finally pulled his mouth free as she began to slide, his grip only loosening from her hip once he&#39;d helped guide her safely to the floor. His jaw hung for a few moments as he caught his breath, eyes having never left her to drink in every whimper and shake he&#39;d set upon her. He finally slid his fingers free to clean them off in his mouth, eyes closing for a moment as her hands combed his hair. He let out a blissful groan, turning his head to kiss her leg where it sat propped up on his shoulder, his arm sliding up along it reverently in gentle strokes. &quot;Beautiful,&quot; he murmured, pressing another kiss, then another, before gently tugging her leg free of his shoulder. He shifted off his knees to sit a little more comfortably, letting her leg drape over one of his extended to the side. From this new position he leaned forward, bracing his forearm against the wall so he could stroke her cheek with the other and press a kiss to her forehead before pulling back enough to gaze into her eyes again and return the grin. &quot;How&#39;re ya feelin?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She realized how reverently she was staring at him at the sound of his voice, eyes fluttering as she felt the press of his lips against her leg and gave him a heavy-lidded smile. 

Her eyes tracked his arm as he pressed it against the wall above her, the gentle expression slowly growing sharper as he leaned in closer. She straightened softly, eagerly into the kiss against her forehead, and by the time he sat back the grin on her face was fanged and the look in her eye hungry as she ran a featherlight touch up his chest.
&quot;Me? I&#39;m <em>good</em>,&quot; she purred, sliding both hands onto his shoulders as she smoothly rose up to kneel on the leg not already hooked around Cha Cha&#39;s waist.
&quot;I&#39;m better than good,&quot; she continued, twining her fingers back into his hair as she used the favorable positioning he&#39;d gifted her to line her hips up over his. Gently tugging on his hair to angle his chin up, she brushed her lips so softly over his as she spoke.
&quot;I&#39;m <em>phenomenal</em>.&quot;
She kissed him then, tongue running over his lip in silent request, and settled onto the length of him as her knees flexed out and slid across the floor. No clothing left between them this time, just the warmth of her softness, the pulse of her thrumming heartbeat, and the utterly soaked condition he&#39;d left her in. Slowly, gently, she started grinding along him anew, a wicked smile curling her kisses.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, December 6, 2023 8:31 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He slowly pushed himself away from the wall as she rose to give her room and found himself sitting up straight, almost leaning back a little as she knelt close. The hand on the wall fell to her waist, thumb stroking her side idly, pausing for a moment when he realized just what she was climbing forward to do. Anticipation pooled in his gut instantly, even as his gaze lifted from her positioning to drink in her gaze, the gentle brush of her lips against his teasing just as the awareness of how close she was, hovering over his dick.

He met her lips greedily, mouth opening at first to greet her tongue and instantly a sharp breath ripped through him, voice a ragged moan. She was so warm, so soft, so <em>wet.</em> If the sight and sound of her hadn&#39;t had him stiff before, he certainly was now. His hand gripped her cheek, sliding back into her hair while the other snaked around her back to drag light nails along her spine. He shifted his position a little to support himself better, his hips rolling against hers to match her pace at first before coherent thought slipped away until there was nothing left but passion and lust.

Spreading his legs for a little more leverage, he rolled his hips <em>heavily</em> against hers, tongue similarly delving into her mouth much as it had below earlier behind a similarly mischievous smile. He tugged her close, possessively so as not to let a single gap between their chests until he could feel the pulse of her heartbeat in his skin just as strongly as his. He fought against the desire to close his eyes and lose himself completely, if only so he could continue to soak in each little twitch and smile on her face, every stolen gasp his lips captured.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, December 6, 2023 9:26 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her back arched at the feel of his nails on her skin, her hands cupping the back of his head sliding up to his cheeks as her fingers ran the length of his jaw. If his fingers and tongue had left her in a state before, the combined sensation and anticipation of her own mischief had her dripping.

When she felt the adjustment of his legs though her half-lidded gaze snapped to lock eyes with him, only to widen with surprise and delight at the toying of his tongue in her mouth, gasping into a soft moan as he pressed forcefully into the grind. She leaned into his pull on her eagerly, humming deeply at the slick rub of his chest against hers as she fell back into rhythm with him, the movements quicker and shorter with her body flush against his.

Before long it registered to her the extent of how soaked they&#39;d become, the range of her thrusting hips harder to gauge. <em>Fuck it then, she was more than ready.</em>
Slowing gradually to a gentle pace, she lifted her hips lightly to give his cock room to come to attention and kissed him deeply, the rise and fall of her chest pressing against him as the thrum of their heartbeats pulsed along the skin contact.  When she pulled away her eyes bore into his, one hand gently guiding him to the entrance of her as she settled into place. The other hand came to rest on his chest, fingers tracing his collarbone as she flashed him a toothy grin, her expression confident and sultry as she started to settle down into him.
The cockiness vanished almost immediately as she paused mid-way down, the surprise that seized her expression laced with pleasure as she exhaled in stuttering gasps. This was.. a lot to take. A lot of <em>him</em>. Damned if she wasn&#39;t going to have all of him though.
&quot;<em>hff</em> -- gods, <em>Ilya</em>, I..&quot; Her gaze swam over his face, hazy even as her brow furrowed and she lifted herself back up ever so slightly and started settling back down. She kissed him fiercely again, groaning desperately against his mouth, her hips rocking gently as she worked her way down.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Thursday, December 7, 2023 8:04 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He closed his eyes and sucked in another stabilizing breath, opening them when he felt her rise. The hand in her hair curled to run his nails along her scalp gently as it dragged back to her cheek, returning that kiss with an almost helpless noise in the back of his throat. His breath hitched in anticipation as he felt her hand guide him, hips stilling against every fiber of his need to allow her all the room and time she needed.

He returned her grin, adoration flashing through the lusty haze in his eyes before her settling earned her another inhale followed by a shakingly pleased sigh. <em>Gods,</em> how he wanted to drive in and rock against her with everything he had. Gauging her surprise though, the glint in his eyes shifted <em>knowingly.</em> He rubbed his thumb gently along her cheek, bringing it forward to brush lightly against the corner of her lips. &quot;Atta girl,&quot; he purred even as his name on her lips sent him twitching with pleasure. It killed him to stay still while she worked him at her own pace, the tiniest shifting of his hips towards hers to meet her settling escaping his self control. How could he with someone so beautiful, so kind and so <em>so important</em> in front of him?

The hand on her back gave her gentle scratches along her spine. He met her lips desperately, welcoming the sensation as a spark of distraction. Not distraction, <em>enhancer.</em> He kissed her deeply, breaking contact for a heavy breath after a few moments, lips lingering near hers. &quot;Niamh...<em>Fuck.</em> Take yer time. I&#39;ll be here all night, promise.&quot; He breathed a laugh. <em>He&#39;d be here as long as she&#39;d have him,</em> he mused, kissing her and her soft lips in greed once again.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Thursday, December 7, 2023 3:49 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As his hand came to her cheek though she tuned back in to her senses - the rumbling of his voice echoing in her ears, the slight twitches of him inside her and the knowing look in his eye, the little thrust of movement before he reigned in his impulses, all of it stoking the fire as a flush rose into her cheeks, deeper and more vibrant than that which had come from working this far down the length of him. Her back curled at the nails on her spine, hands grasping for purchase in the crook of his neck as she met his kiss over, and over, and over as she slid into him, until finally her hips met his. Fully seated. Her breathing came in shallow gasps as she took a moment to let the tension ebb from her body, accommodating him in full. Gods above, the pressure of him sent a fire roaring through her, every touch heightened tenfold as her skin prickled.

She gave the newfound position an experimental shift, rocking against him at an easy cadence. The sensation was phenomenal - slick and warm and with the size of him she was so very <em>aware</em> of how he fit into her, every inch every millimeter. Aware of the heat and throbbing pulse. The fire returned to her gut with a roar as she wound her hips back, kicking forward once more with force as her gaze snapped up to meet his. A quiet moan broke the plane of her lips as she paused, hands sliding up to his jaw to pull him close as she brushed her lips against his.
A second thrust, and she pressed in close, gently grabbing his lip with her teeth as her eyes fluttered with the effort of keeping them from rolling fully back into her head.
The third rock of her hips blazed a trail for the flurry that followed, her grip on him tightening as tremors shot through her with each brushing pass of his cock against that sweet spot. Any of the taunts she had intended to play in the exchange evaporated from her mind as she found her pace, touching her forehead to his as she huffed his name in a desperate groan.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Willing his hips still, he redirected that pooling in his gut towards his hands and lips. As she curled into the gentle nails, he gave her another encouraging stroke with them down her back, each little kiss a reward to egg her on as she stubbornly moved to take all of him. And when she finally did.. oh, how aware he was of just how warm and wet she was, fitting so snugly he was almost afraid to move. He kissed the corner of her lips to her chin, moving along her jaw up to her ear as she settled.

It was his turn to gasp as she gave him a testing rock, his hips answering her call against his desires to let her adjust at her own pace. His breath warm against her ear, he gave it a nip as she pulled free, curling with a shuddered desperate moan as she slid back down. He moved to meet her gaze under heavy lids, each subtle movement sending sparks along his skin. He eagerly leaned in to the hands along his jaw to press his lips against hers once again, rewarding her teeth with a hopeless noise, infatuation grasping his hands which curled into her back with more pressure, his consciousness desire to be delicate waning.

Once he was sure she was comfortable, he finally allowed his hips to answer her call, driving each thrust deep with reckless abandon and a strength he’d been holding back. Electricity seemed to rip through him with each reconnection, tearing wordless pleas from his lips that sounded suspiciously like her name in reply. He tensed, the coil in his gut winding tighter and tighter in warning as he reached his precipice. He opened his mouth to warn her and instead let out a full throated groan as he came under the pressure of just one more thrust. His whole body tensed until it shook, his head twisting to greedily capture her lips with his once more while his arms curled all the tighter with dragging fingers. Though his thrusts began to stagger he grunted in determination and made each one count for her, determined to return the favor.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was soft, tender, thoughtful, and her respect for him ran deep.

In this moment though what she <em>really</em> appreciated was the unfettered power that he&#39;d come back at her with, matching her energy with a strength she&#39;d seen but not experienced as the force of him filling her sent a shockwave through her body that left her eyes unfocused, a ragged bark of a shout escaping her as she dug her nails into his shoulders. Every driving thrust into her earned him a rasping growl of pleasure as she matched his tempo, waves of sensation pulsing through her that drove out any thought that didnt involve the slam of their hips, the feel of his muscles working under her hands, or the urge to run her tongue up the column of his throat when he managed to choke out something that might have been her name. She settled for kissing it instead, but her resolve faltered as he shifted in a way that pressed her clit against his skin to add new friction to the equation, and she latched onto him with her teeth and a ragged cry in a way that was definitely going to leave a mark.

She felt his body tense, as dialed in as she was to every touch and movement, and lifted her head to meet his eye as he loosed that bellowing groan, igniting the spark in her eye as she gave a ragged gasp of delight at the sudden heat and spilling that pooled between them. She met his kiss eagerly, groaning against his lips as his pace faltered but carried through on sheer force of will. She wasn&#39;t about to disappoint him.
Hooking her arms under his shoulders she leveraged herself solidly against him, angling her hips so that even his staggered rhythm would reach that sweet spot inside her. He didnt have much work left to do - within the first three passes she had her mouth pressed against his neck to smother the moan mounting in her throat, the added slickness speeding up the climb of that wave of pressure that curled through her body. By the seventh her hips were bucking against him, the moaning replaced by a ragged snarl as her nails dug in. The next hit sent her spasming once more, some feral noise ripping from her throat as she rode him to the end.
When she finally stilled, it was im a slow collapse against his chest, panting, laughing hoarsely.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Here he was, a bear of a man, entirely undone and at her every mercy, and loving every second of it. He bit down on his lower lip as he focused on every last thrust, arms moving just so they wouldn&#39;t get in her way of angling herself, little moans and gasps escaping him all the same. His head fell back as she pressed against his neck again, back arching into her as her nails clawed him until that final thrust that sent her back over once more. Crooning her name between the rocking of their bodies, he kept going until she finally collapsed.

He slowly inhaled a deep, shuddered breath, exhaling a breathy laugh in reply to hers with a dumb grin permanently etched onto his face. With a grunt, he fell backwards to lay down, his core burning from being used in ways it had long stopped being used to. The grip on her back relaxed to lazily stroke along her spine, one hand moving up to paw through her hair and brush it out of her face, his head moving until he could get another good look at her.

<em>&quot;Fuck.&quot;</em> He whispered, eyes pinching tight for just a moment before blinking to clear some of the haze. He felt so, so warm, tingles fuzzy in his limbs in a way that made him want to just lay there forever with her in his arms. He let out a snort, then another, unable to help himself with another laugh, eyes squinting mirthfully at her. &quot;We made a mess.&quot; He said, the lilt of his voice playful and naughty.

He swallowed, stroking her cheek before carding his fingers through her hair again. &quot;Still good?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

After a moment of humming happily at his hand along her back, she peered up at him through her lashes and wiggled herself just a touch higher on him to rest her cheek on his chest. Bliss. 

Her face turned up as he endeavored to brush away the hair plastered to her face, gaze roving over his face left in a very similar state. She did wince at the observation though, a modicum of guilt on her face that was quickly followed by cat-like smugness as she propped her chin up on the back of her hand laid flat over his chest. 
&quot;Still better than good,&quot; she murmured, grinning down at him with a wink. &quot;We made a huge mess. And I&#39;m going to make apology cookies for your neighbors in the morning.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Quickly he made his peace with it, exhaling a satisfied sigh after a moment, looking back to her. &quot;Mm.. worth it.&quot;

He was content to lay there for a while, letting the feeling work its way back into his limbs. The longer he lay there, the heavier his eyelids started drooping, the hand on her back stroking less frequently. Despite everything he felt so comfortable, the subtle sound of her breathing and the weight on his chest lulling him into a deep sense of peace. He grunted quietly, beginning the slow push to sit himself back up again, one arm still roped around Niamh&#39;s waist.

&quot;If we keep laying here I might fall asleep... ya really put me to work.&quot; He chuckled, pressing a tired kiss to her cheek. Even spent, he couldn&#39;t help but to linger close with touch and kisses. How he&#39;d ever wondered if she&#39;d felt for him, he had no idea, not after tonight. &quot;We could go get cleaned up.. or take this to somewhere more comfortable.

Her hand continued combing gentle strokes even as her eyes shut, humming a gentle tune to herself in an attempt to stave off falling asleep entirely. Contented. Comfortable. And still riding the high of being able to drop the veil over her affections for him. Her eyes fluttered open as he shifted underneath her, pushing up lightly to face him.

She smiled gently at him as he confessed his fatigue, leaning in to make it easier for him to kiss her wherever he pleased. He got a laugh at his offer though, a faux-envy narrowing her eyes as she tucked loose strands of hair behind his ear.
&quot;Damn, lucky bitches.&quot; She paused, flashing him an apologetic smile. &quot;We should really clean up though,&quot; she admitted, and then to demonstrate peeled her abdomen away from his with a distinct sticky sound.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Aye, definitely need a little cleanup. Allow me..&quot; steadily Cha Cha shifted in his seat to bring his legs under him, the arm around her waist steady but loosening so the pair could finally, almost regrettably, separate. And then with dancing fingers trailing along the skin of her leg, he moved to literally sweep her off her feet in a bridal style swipe. He began to rise, steadying himself with the wall on the way up.

&quot;Something tells me yer legs might need to recover.&quot; He purred in a pleased smugness, stepping out of the room towards the bathroom.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As they moved carefully through the room, she tucked her head under his chin and let her feet swing to an easy tempo, one hand roaming across his chest again as the other clutched gently at the totem around her neck. With a clearer head, she mused on the gift he&#39;d given her earlier - a full first name, his real name, and felt the warmth curling in her chest again. The memory drifted slightly though, and she remembered briefly the offer she&#39;d made that prompted him to share in the first place. 
&quot;Jasper, by the way,&quot; she muttered, tracing a finger along his collarbone. &quot;Like that stone I put in Nils&#39; bracelet. I went by that name most of my life until I came to Fielbarry and decided to shed it entirely. Fresh start and all that.&quot; She paused, watching her hand on his skin as her fingers began dotting a trail to a tempo, counting out the steps.
&quot;Also, Da taught me to dance. Used to be pretty good at it, under his guidance.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He made an inquisitive sound as she spoke up, the bracelet coming to mind instantly though it took him a moment longer to realize what she meant before it clicked. &quot;Jasper.&quot; He echoed thoughtfully. &quot;It&#39;s pretty.&quot;

He paused a moment to consider, gently nudging the door to the bathroom open with a shoulder. When he&#39;d told her his name, he&#39;d told her she could use it (and he was ever grateful that she had.) &quot;Do ya want me to call ya that? Both are nice.&quot;

That little dance of fingers on his chest felt almost whimsical, though as she continued speaking he could almost imagine the memory dancing behind her eyes. He remembered the fondness she&#39;d had speaking of him some time ago, back in the kitchen with tamarinds and coconuts and a bottle of rum to share on a pleasant afternoon. &quot;I never really learned how to dance.

As much as the name had started as a token of endearment, she bore it now like a crown of thorns. &quot;I think I&#39;d rather not. Maybe one day I&#39;ll be able to hear it and not think of all the bad that comes with it. Maybe getting you to use it will be how it happens.

Her head lifted at the rumble of his chuckling, bright eyed and eager to see him smiling again.
&quot;Not as often as I&#39;d like. It&#39;s lonely going without a partner and Lil Mans&#39; feet dont touch the ground.

He laughed at the mental image of her trying to dance with Lil Man, accompanied by memories of a smattering of Lil Man noises he&#39;s heard over the past year and the following <em>&#39;What was that?&#39;</em> &#39;s that occasionally followed. &quot;Aye, best to dance with someone yer own size.&quot;

Nudging the bathroom door shut with his ass, he moved over to the tub to gently begin lowering Niamh out of his arms so she could stand (or try to, depending on how wobbly she was still feeling.) The tub itself was standard size, which meant it would be a smidge small if they both tried to hop in together, not that Cha Cha seemed to mind, muttering a quiet <em>&quot;ladies first.&quot;</em>

He cleared his throat, looking towards the ceiling for a moment. &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been dancing properly before. I eh... don&#39;t know how good of a dance partner I&#39;d be, but if it makes ya happy, I&#39;d be willing to learn. Try to, anyways.

She gave him a grin at his amusement in her choice of dance partner to this point, and pressed a soft kiss to his cheek before unfolding from his arms onto the bathroom floor. With her feet underneath her and her hands looped gently around Cha Cha&#39;s neck, she rose onto her toes in a lazy en pointe a couple times as if to test their load-bearing capacity - stealing one more kiss on the last lift. Looking over her shoulder to the tub, she hummed lightly at his invitation and sat herself on the edge of the tub to stopper the drain and start the water running.
Her attention perked up at his hesitant offer though, looking back up to him wide-eyed - and then appreciatively.
&quot;I think you&#39;d be a perfect partner. If I&#39;m even half as good a teacher as Da was it&#39;ll be easy to pick up.&quot; Sparing a glance to the steady flow of water to gauge the rate it filled, she pushed onto her feet and set herself before him with her palms held before her.

It certainly didn&#39;t hurt to hear it on Niamh&#39;s lips though.

He returned the little kiss as she tested her legs, letting her go enough once he was sure she was stable on her own. As she moved to sit on the edge of the tub he leaned against the wall near her, arms crossing comfortably in front of him in his lounged position. As she got up and offered her hands towards him though, he blinked before pushing himself off the wall to stand before her, large hands delicately taking hers with the sort of caution that came with trying something new. &quot;Aye.

Standing square in front of him, she brought her other hand to rest on his shoulder, her thumb brushing gently over one of the myriad scars as she looked up into his face.
&quot;There&#39;s only a couple steps, after that its just how you apply them. Think of it like drawing a square with your toes,&quot; she explained, gently bumping his right leg with her left.
&quot;This is the first line.&quot;
She stepped back with her left leg then, creating room for his right to move forward.
&quot;Your other leg follows and then moves to the side to make the top line of the square.&quot; Drawing her right leg back so she was once again standing with her feet together, she gave a nod at the space created for his left. She paused briefly in that position before moving it back out to the side, and drawing her left leg up beside it - one half of the box step completed.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He too liked the more casual version, he decided with a gentle rub of her back.

He looked down as she began explaining the steps, focusing on their legs and feet as she bumped his leg. Slowly his feet moved along where she indicated, weight awkwardly shifting a few times between the steps. Right forward, Left forward, out to the side. It seemed simple enough, following her.

He looked up again as she dropped to her feet, smile a bit wider with some satisfaction. If this was dancing, surely even he could do it. &quot;Not bad at all,&quot; he nodded, leaning in to steal a gentle kiss, though his expression had some distant amusement, flashes of dancers coming to mind. &quot;Feels deceptively simple though.

He returned her grin, giving her hand a little squeeze back, the thumb on her back rubbing lightly. &quot;Yer certainly making a compelling case for it.&quot;

He blinked out of the moment as the sounds of water and the tub snapped back into conscious memory, stepping over to help stop it had she not been fast enough. He looked down at the water, grateful that while it had gotten dangerously close to the top of the tub, it hadn&#39;t quite spilled over the precipice. Which was nice and all, but that also meant it definitely <em>would</em> if she got in. Or if he reached a meaty arm in to pull the plug and let some drain.

&quot;At least the stopper works.&quot; He chuckled with a shake of his head.  Making his peace with the oncoming mess, he reached an arm in to tug the stopper, the water beginning to drain with a hungry rush to more acceptable levels.

 &quot;Thats on me for distracting you - let me at least get some towels down. It&#39;d be a damn shame to cut this thing short because one of us slipped and died getting out of the tub,&quot; she mused wryly, chasing the overflow as best she could.

Once the water levels were more manageable she perched herself on the edge of the tub beside him, grimacing lightly at the tangles she&#39;d introduced to his normally sleek dark hair. She didnt regret it though. Not the process anyway. Just a little guilt about the snarled mess.
Squeezing his arm, she nodded gently to the water behind him before standing to go fish for the salts and soaps she and Cain had stashed a few days prior.
&quot;Why dont you hop in first? I can wash your hair nore easily if I&#39;m not dripping more of a mess onto your floors.&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, December 9, 2023 6:50 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was comforting to be able to just reach out and steal touches or glances, novel in how that seal had broken between them with ease. Earlier today, they&#39;d just been friends. Now they sat around together completely comfortably in the nude, decidedly something else. It was a nice change.

His eyes refocused from the thought, realizing he&#39;d been staring at her, as she suggested he go for a dip first. A hand raised to his hair to drag through it snagged on a knot or two. Though he opened his mouth to protest going first... the offer to wash his hair for him was enticing. &quot;Well, if ya insist.&quot; He said, trying not to sound too eager as he pulled away from the wall.

He stepped past her, gingerly stepping into the tub to settle in. From her vantage behind him, she had full view of that perfect plush ass of his.. along with the very modestly sized fuzzy bear tail that peeked out just over them in a small patch of true fur compared to the rest of his body hair.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Just tantalizing enough, then. 
She had <em>not</em>, however, expected to steal a peek at his ass and be blessed with the fuzziest nub of a tail. Immediately her hand flew to her mouth to smother the gasp of delight, and she bit down on her thumb with the continued effort of trying to be normal about the discovery. So fluffy. <em>So widdle</em>. Compared to the rest of his towering self anyway. <em>Please dont make it weird you&#39;ll spook him.</em>
&quot;You know, I&#39;d wondered if your other form manifested on you in the normal day to day. The bear part, that is. Um. Shifter traits.&quot; Nailed it.
In a poorly contained effort to be nonchalant she busied herself rifling through the soaps and hair oils that had magically appeared under the sink shortly after she and Cain started spending the night, examining the vanilla scented scrub with intense interest. The same one she used every day. Those four ingredients warranted scrutiny.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He rested an arm on the edge of the tub, twisting his hand to admire it. &quot;Well, my nails are pretty thick, plus they grow a lot longwr than a normal person&#39;s if I don&#39;t keep em trimmed. They kinda get in the way if they get too long, but I&#39;d let em grow out some when I was living on the road. Y&#39;know, like a backup weapon or something.&quot;

He paused thoughtfully, then cleared his throat in a quiet noise, voice almost sheepish as he continued. &quot;Um. Well I also have a little tail. Just got the one patch of fur and it ain&#39;t too big, so usually I can just hide it with a higher waist on my pants.&quot; No wonder he never wore anything that gripped just at his hips.. although his fat ass was probably also to blame, with the likelihood of it coming free with a lower waistband a real possibility.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Other than being a really gangly kid the only identifiable trait on me is the sideburns,&quot; she explained sheepishly, trying to verbally right the wagon as she stepped gingerly into the water and seated herself on the edge behind him.  &quot;I&#39;m just glad I grew into my arms.&quot;
Drawing up water to wet his hair, she started gently detangling some of the worst of the snarls with her fingers, running her nails along his scalp with each pass.

It&#39;d been a long time since anyone had seen it, let alone thought it was <em>cute.</em> The compliment settled in that weird middle ground that he&#39;d been carving out for himself as he got used to the idea that he was actually still attractive, if only just to Niamh. It was a surprising, if nice feeling, and he felt himself smiling back at her grin.

As she settled behind him and explained her own noticeable features from growing up he nodded in understanding, a hand reaching back to gently trail fingers along her arm soothingly. He chuckled as she mentioned her arms, his small smile broadening some. &quot;I think ya turned out just fine, fangs &#39;n all. Besides, yer sideburns are cute.&quot; He assured.

Those nails along his scalp were comforting, even as she began detangling the knots from his hair, and he closed his eyes with a relaxed sigh. Quietly he was grateful she&#39;d offered to wash his hair, finding the motions a gentle comfort he could almost lose himself in. It took him a moment to realize she&#39;d asked a question, eyes blinking open. He hummed thoughtfully, craning his head back a little to look at her from where he sat. &quot;Nah, not really. It&#39;s small enough that it doesn&#39;t get in the way at all, &#39;n I can hide it if I&#39;m with people I don&#39;t trust. Nowadays, I just keep to the clothes I&#39;m comfortable with so there&#39;s not been much of a need t&#39;show it off.&quot;

He grinned with a snort. &quot;Besides, I ain&#39;t exactly keen to show off my ass to the world. It gets enough comments as it is.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sitting there gently working her hands through his hair, the soft doting expression that had been the theme of the night was back on her face as she listened to him talk. She laughed brightly at the callout though, immediately making a guilty noise in the back of her throat like a kid getting caught with her hand in the cookie jar.
&quot;For what it&#39;s worth I do apologize for being a shameless fan of your ass. It is very shapely and I know it came from a shit ton of hard work, which I respect the hell out of,&quot; she murmured, leaning forward to press a kiss onto the top of his head. &quot;Its gonna be so much harder to not cop a feel when opportunity strikes now, though,&quot; she grumbled, grinning against his hair before sitting back up and fishing for the hair oils.
&quot;Also you&#39;re going to smell like me for a bit - we can go to the botanicals place tomorrow and get you a bottle if you wanted to switch away from the unscented stuff. I also just like this mix for the olive oil he adds in.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I&#39;m not saying ya <em>can&#39;t</em> cop a feel when we&#39;re out and about, but.. well, <em>some</em> restraint would be appreciated.&quot; He was, after all, still primarily a private man. She&#39;d seen the balance he struck when horsing around with Nils in public though, and he trusted her.

He settled a little more where he sat, knees bumping up a little to make room in the tub. His head hung comfortably in her grip, content to let her do as she pleased. &quot;If yer gonna sit there and comb it into my hair like this, ya can make me smell however the hell ya want me to smell for all I care. I&#39;m definitely not gonna complain about smelling like ya.&quot; He looked away for a moment, running fingers through his beard to idly comb it. &quot;Been one of the nice things about ya and Cain staying over recently I realized is that my bed started to smell like ya.

Tone aside, there was a dose of sincerity on the assurance. They&#39;d gotten far on mutual respect, she didn&#39;t intend for that to change now.

She hummed happily as he relaxed further into the tub and set herself to scrubbing, the sweetness from the vanilla scent quickly swirling about them on the air. As he spoke she thought back to the lineup on the shelves from the last time she&#39;d been in the store, wondering if the Sandalwood option she&#39;d almost grabbed would be redundant on him.
His shift in attention pulled her focus back though, and she responded initially with a pleased hum, something raunchy clearly forming on her tongue. But she hesitated instead, feeling suddenly grateful once more to be sober so she had the wherewithal to read between the lines of his comment. The hesitation turned into a pause while she worked his hair into a lather, her brow creasing lightly as she chewed at the inside of her cheek.
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I... That it took for something ugly to happen. To get to this point.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At least it was an indication she wasn&#39;t the only one with ideas or an appreciation for the other&#39;s ass.

He frowned gently at the apology, as though she were solely responsible for the slow dance they&#39;d done over the past year taking as long as it did, or for having the audacity to have gone through something so ugly she&#39;d needed to seek comfort in the first place. If anything, he felt like he was at fault. He twisted a little where he sat, pulling free of her hands so he could face her, hand stroking her cheek as it slid back into her hair. 

&quot;Ya don&#39;t need to apologize, Niamh, it&#39;s not yer fault. I didn&#39;t even realize I <em>wanted</em> this until recently, and by then ya already had Cain and Yarrow. I didn&#39;t want to... I liked what we had well enough. I was happy enough just bein yer friend.&quot; He said, one corner of his lips twitching in a gentle smile.

The way the night had evolved had been like a simmering pot long coming to boil, but their friendship had always been a higher priority to him than the off chance she&#39;d felt anything for him, especially with how practiced he was at focusing on the greater good over his own personal feelings. It was easier to keep going as usual when something more selfish didn&#39;t seem feasible in the first place. He really could have been perfectly happy just being there as her friend until the end, even if he was selfishly grateful that for all the bad that had happened, they&#39;d salvaged something good from the mess.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Things had gotten so complicated so quickly - the escalation of their friendship, the upcoming travels and the dangers that entailed, whatever the situation was with Cain and Yarrow that she hadn&#39;t even thought to bring up yet and see what his boundaries were on the situation. Was it any wonder that their friendship hadn&#39;t wavered beyond what was comfortable for the past year?
&quot;I was too, for a while. And I didnt want to risk it - wasn&#39;t willing to. Not when it came with Nils and Cass, and Margret and Stefan. I was content to leave it at that.&quot; Her brow furrowed fully as she let her gaze drift to the worn old scars across his chest, some of them reminiscent of where Ephialtes&#39; nightmare had cleaved across him.

&quot;I knew what I saw wasnt real while we were there and on the ride home. When Cain and I came by to see you it was only supposed to be that - to remind myself that everyone was fine. That Nuala was fine and had all her feathers, that you were fine and still in one piece instead of four.&quot; Her expression twisted lightly as she fought to keep the visceral memories at bay, though the hand that ran his hair slick with oil through her fingers was actively sabotaging her.

He swallowed, shifting more so he could sit up enough and draw her into a hug, pressing a kiss to her forehead before pressing his cheek against her. Here he was, alive and well.

He let out a knowing, somber chuckle. Life <em>was</em> short, wasn&#39;t it? &quot;Ya&#39;d think I&#39;d have learned that by now, wouldn&#39;t ya? Sometimes I think back to when I lost Nils and Cass and... it tore me up then, knowing they&#39;d had their whole lives still, and it was just me left to live it.

Her heart became heavy with a familiar sympathy as he recounted the pain of losing Nils and Cass - not the first time he&#39;d talked about it, but she ached for him all the same. Thirty years without two of the people he&#39;d loved most was such a long time to soldier on, and she couldn&#39;t begin to imagine what it was like. The visions in the mansion had torn her up, though they were not only temporary but that version of Saoirse had also presented her with the butchered remains of the people that had come into her life here in Fielbarry, most of the bonds less than a year old - a far cry from lasting childhood friendships. In a rather cruel stroke, she found her mind wandering in a brief snap of a thought to Edan and how he must have felt when he found her on the night she left for good.
Too much. 
Reigning in her thoughts, she nodded her agreement - he&#39;d kept on and so had she, and that was the easy part. Finding the fulfillment that came in between was what made it hard.

As he pulled back, the look in his eye pulled the softness back into her expression as she brought her hands to rest on his, and she nodded confidently.
&quot;Aye. We&#39;ll make it look easy,&quot; she added with a grin and a self-assuredness that was as much self soothing as it was a bold declaration.

He gave her one more peck on the lips before twisting back to relax in the tub and let her drag those gentle nails across his scalp and rinse the oils from his hair. He closed his eyes and let himself melt into the sensations, a pleased rumble escaping him. <em>We&#39;ll make it look easy</em> had been the declaration, though Cha Cha knew they&#39;d stumbled forward into this a little suddenly. They&#39;d make it work, but they&#39;d have to learn this new dance together to do it.

His mind wandered back for a moment, a thoughtful frown on his lips. The last thing he wanted to do was to have things change so much that it felt uncomfortable for her. With some measure of caution and casualness to his voice, he cleared his throat. &quot;Speakin of people we care about, uh..

She supposed she would be hunting down those ventilation masks after all. Her hands worked through Cha Cha&#39; s hair in practiced motions as her mind wandered, only to be pulled back to attention when he spoke. Ah, yes - that conversation. She wished she had a better answer for him but in truth she hadn&#39;t processed much on where she stood with those two since they returned home.
&quot;If by sleeping with them you mean it in the literal sense, then yeah. It&#39;s.. The experiences we had together in Ghalasine and Longwatch forged a bond that we didnt expect. Everything that happened in the mansion led to us relying on each other for comfort while we struggled to process what we were seeing, and physical contact was our primary means of supporting each other when we couldn&#39;t find the words, so.. Sleeping alone hasn&#39;t really been an option.&quot;
Her head tilted as her gaze started roaming over his face, a curious smile spreading across her features.

Though, as she confirmed against <em>sleeping</em> with them, his cheeks darkened slightly at the idea. 

&quot;I see,&quot; he murmured, combing his beard with a stroke. He was quiet for a moment before he spoke up again, words somewhat cautious but genuine as he tried putting his thoughts in order. As much as he was a singular affection-oriented person, he knew her affection drew a wider net. Even if it wasn&#39;t quite as deep as he&#39;d wondered.
&quot;I think it&#39;s nice that they&#39;ve been there for ya this whole time. And I&#39;m grateful for them to have helped ya when I couldn&#39;t have.

Not because there was anything left to rinse from it, but the busying helped tamp down on the little bit of nervous energy she was feeling. When he did speak though, he had the whole of her attention and an easy smile that slipped onto her face. Reaching for the leave-in conditioning oils that were her favorite, she busied herself with working them into the ends of his hair - but not before leaning forward to press a kiss to the top of his head, and lingering for a moment as she responded.
&quot;I appreciate it - truly. The door&#39;s always open for you if you&#39;re in need of a dog-pile of cuddling, mind. But if anything ever comes up that starts pushing your boundaries I want you to tell me immediately. I&#39;m not trying to put this on the line while we&#39;re still figuring it out.&quot;

Satisfied with her efforts working the last of the conditioner into his hair, she started picking out pieces of hair for the beginning of a braid that would keep it from making too much of a mess while they slept. As she twisted the locks together, the familiarity drew up a thoughtful grumble and a light flush to her cheeks.
&quot;Um.. What do you want to tell Nils? If anything, of course. And Cass. And the parents?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It&#39;s all pretty new to me so far, but I&#39;m willing to give it a shot for ya. Hopefully it&#39;s just about as easy as learning to waltz.&quot;

He let his eyes close as she worked in the conditioner, letting his mind wander nowhere in particular while he enjoyed the gentle movements of her hands, the telltale tugging of a braid forming. The question of what to tell Nils and Cass and their parents blinked his eyes back open, a similar flush dusting his cheeks in realization. Oh yeah, they&#39;d probably need to know too, huh. He let out a little groan and a sheepish chuckle, looking back up at her. &quot;Ma&#39;s going to be insufferable,&quot; he complained fondly, already imagining Margret&#39;s silver tongue, perfectly poised to embarrass the pair with her congratulations.

A hand raised to gently lift the totem still hung around her neck so he could admire it just as much as he admired the way it felt right on her. &quot;I have a feeling they might figure it out pretty quickly. I may not be as touchy as ya and Cain can be, but if ya think I&#39;m keeping my hands to myself from here on out, yer mistaken.&quot; It&#39;d been hard enough to resist little stolen touches beforehand, but now that they&#39;d broken the seal, was intent to enjoy this new development where he could.

Her expression softened as he picked up the totem again, her hands coming to rest on either side of his jaw as she gently scratched her nails through the beard and stubble. She laughed at the assurance though, shuffling in her seat and curling over him to brush her lips gently against his in an upside-down kiss, hair tumbling down to pool on the surface of the water.

Running a hand over his hair experimentally, he nodded in approval and vowed to do his best to return the favor. Promising as much, he climbed from the tub to swap places with Niamh, large hands delicately combing through her hair with the same reverence he&#39;d shown all evening. With the more pressing worries addressed, his conversation turned to idle musings and comments on the day around town, interspersed with the occasional little kiss.

Once they&#39;d toweled off and drained the water, that tired feeling from before crept back into his limbs, and it took very little convincing to return to the bedroom. That night he slept deeply, arms locked around Niamh and nose buried blissfully into her hair. While normally he had been a light sleeper, a blessing whenever Niamh or Cain had woken up during the night, the morning arrived unnoticed by the old bear, who merely grumbled under his breath and buried his face a little tighter to hide away from that gentle light.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The braid he&#39;d twisted her hair into had mostly held through the night, the shorter curlier hairs framing her face having come loose to hang in her eyes. She&#39;d only partially dressed herself, slipping back into her undergarments to move around the room on silent feet while she let him sleep, and busied herself with her promises from the night before. The warm smell of vanilla and cinnamon hanging in the air was the evidence of an early start, but now she sidled in close to brush the stray hair away from his face with a warm smile.

If they didn&#39;t have things they likely needed to do, he would&#39;ve been tempted to lay in just a little longer. &quot;Ya made me tea?&quot; he asked, touched.

He nuzzled in to press a kiss to her lips gratefully, humming before slowly pushing himself up a little on an elbow.

While he knew his presence had been helping ever since the girls returned, it was nice to hear just how much he really helped. And, noting her roving gaze, he certainly didn&#39;t mind the method they&#39;d taken to tire themselves out from the day&#39;s troubles.

The timer&#39;s ding pulled his mind back to the present, head turning towards the kitchen for a moment before nodding back to her in approval. &quot;Not a bad idea, I don&#39;t think I know anyone who doesn&#39;t like snickerdoodles. And if for whatever reason they do, well that&#39;s just more cookies for us.&quot;

With a grunt he finally pulled himself free, sliding his legs over the edge to stand and stretch, back turned towards Niamh giving her a perfect view of the shift of his muscles, ass, and that little tail. He moved over to the dresser, pulling free a change in underclothes and pants, though the shirt he tugged free out of habit got a glance before being tossed her way. &quot;Here, have a clean shirt. Ya liked the other one well enough.&quot; He said, tugging his clothes on.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He got a laugh as she caught the shirt against her chest, finally pushing herself off the bed to join him as she pulled it over her head. The fit was just as baggy as the first one, the neck hole threatening to slip down her shoulder as she stretched her arms out behind her languidly.
&quot;They&#39;re well-worn and all the softer for it, I love them,&quot; she hummed, rubbing her cheek with a sleeve as she padded into the kitchen and busied herself pulling the first batch out.
&quot;We can set some of these aside. For testing. In case the eggs have gone bad, or something.&quot; The grin she flashed at him was reminiscent of the conspiratorial plotting over dinner the night before - particularly because she knew he&#39;d bought those eggs just a couple days prior.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He remembered that particular one, because he&#39;d been helping hold a goat still for a neighbor before it wriggled free of his arms in a sudden fit of energy, a stray hoof ripping a tear.

At Niamh&#39;s conspiratory tone his pleasant smile turned sly and knowing, giving her a casual nod and a stroke of his beard. &quot;Aye, of course. Never feed someone ya like something ya wouldn&#39;t eat yourself, after all. That&#39;s just poor manners.&quot;

He leaned in just enough to take a sniff as the cookies were pulled free, letting out a pleased grumble. Though he eyed them hungrily, he knew better than to reach for them just yet. &quot;These look professional, though I&#39;d expect nothin less from ya considering all those treats we made over the summer.&quot;

While she pulled the cookies free, he pulled out a plate to set down nearby, followed by a container for the rest of the cookies. &quot;I think I got somethin around here I can use for wrapping them up.&quot; he called over his shoulder, moseying to one of his many shelves to dig through some of his baskets of materials and tools. Surely a nice cheesecloth or something similar would work just fine.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Skirting around the Vikings, she cleared the remaining clutter of maps and reports from the table so there was actually room for them to sit and eat, her gaze flicking to Cha Cha as she  looked for confirmation that they&#39;d intended to bring him food and then have said breakfast in his room.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Maybe they could even be fully dressed.

He nodded to Niamh at her confirmation, giving her shoulder a small squeeze. At least that was a usual motion for them built over a year of friendship, though the kiss pressed to the side of her temple was not. &quot;I&#39;ll get some plates fer everyone. Why don&#39;t y&#39;all sit down?&quot;

Cheeks and ears still quite red (especially from the gesture), he shuffled back towards the kitchen to make good on collecting them all plates and silverware to sit down, bringing them back with cups to match as well. &quot;Can I get ya anything else fer breakfast? I can make omelettes or something.&quot; He asked collectively.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Mmm! I can tell, these are perfect. But yeah, if you wanna throw some on a plate I&#39;ll bring them back to Ma and Dad so they can have some too.&quot;

He pulled off his coat and went to help Cass out of hers, setting then both aside before taking a seat at the table. &quot;I&#39;m always down for more food. Never been particular to lutefisk myself, no matter how much Dad tried to get me to like it. But most Holbrekkians love it. Fish jello just didn&#39;t do it for me.&quot; He winked at Niamh. &quot;So don&#39;t feel bad if it&#39;s not to your taste.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Rolling the stack of parchment tightly, she gave a thoughtful hum before popping the tube up to her brow in a salute.
&quot;We&#39;ll find out one way or the other, I&#39;ve been on a bit of a bold streak the past twelve hours or so. No point stopping now.&quot;
Her lazy backpedaling as she spoke put her back at the threshold of the bedroom, though she spared a moment to bonk Cha Cha&#39;s hip with the bundle before slipping into the room to stash them. When she reappeared a couple moments later her pants were also back on, Cha Cha&#39;s shirt once more artfully tucked into the waistband.
&quot;Did either of you want tea? I just had the kettle on a bit ago.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
