They were notable figures if only due to the rarity with which those outside of their own kind ever glimpsed such individuals--immediately identifiable from nothing but their unique silhouettes as centaurs. They walked shoulder to shoulder, bodies close enough to occasionally brush against one another, and even if the slightly-smaller of the two had not been limping (seeming to favor one of their hind legs), they would still both look as tired and quietly miserable as they were.

The road they followed was faint. It had been weathered into the land centuries, even millennia ago, but it was not often traversed. The reason was simple: the area was inhospitable, but the path through was necessary. It was a road that was, at times, treacherous to walk, but created a marginally safer path around the southern rim of the Valliel desert than it would be to cut through said desert&#39;s shifting dunes. Moving further south, away from the desert, would have had them easily lost in unfamiliar, prickly wildlands--so while this road did not make for a comfortable travel, and was likely not without various predators flanking its path, the two travelers, in many ways, found themselves between a rock and a hard place. At least this path could be followed further west, towards where the sun was disappearing behind the craggy peaks, and they would have some shred of faith that they would not become lost in the vicious land around them.

The smaller centaur looked up as a shadow passed across the ground around them, but her stride did not so much as falter as a massive predatory bird swooped down with a few heavy wingbeats to land on a thick, leather harness covering her back. Her ears angled gently back to listen to the bird settle in to its makeshift (but quite effective) perch, even as her hand moved to rummage through a bag hanging on the side of her lower shoulder, ultimately producing a strip of what appeared to be a manner of jerky. The food was offered back ever so slightly, and the large, white and grey eagle seamlessly leaned forward to pluck it out of her fingers and set about gulping it down.

&quot;... We should find somewhere to rest,&quot; she said quietly, her voice barely above a whisper.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1106791805632122971 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1106791805632122971><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, May 12, 2023 8:55 PM">8:55 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1106786817816145980/1106791805321760808/gsW6rN4RP6Xocp8qvz9iDqLRDeCpxoXfOJxkWlAX5S1T5YdYcV9lObmLZl9OLqCmIfuL7cN15B3NxZHHGBQs600.png?ex=655835b1&amp;is=6545c0b1&amp;hm=c6b969e5fb26309fd1a6fce6d6ad0d22734a7c940dda96c25546a26947548bc2&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1106786817816145980/1106791805321760808/gsW6rN4RP6Xocp8qvz9iDqLRDeCpxoXfOJxkWlAX5S1T5YdYcV9lObmLZl9OLqCmIfuL7cN15B3NxZHHGBQs600.png?ex=655835b1&amp;is=6545c0b1&amp;hm=c6b969e5fb26309fd1a6fce6d6ad0d22734a7c940dda96c25546a26947548bc2&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: gsW6rN4RP6Xocp8qvz9iDqLRDeCpxoXfOJxkWlAX5S1T5YdYcV9lObmLZl9OLqCmIfuL7cN15B3NxZHHGBQs600.png (183.73 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

In one hand he held a spear, held loosely along his flank, the fletched stone tip pointed toward the ground, and his face was hidden by a mask made of a horse&#39;s skull, painted black with gold dusted along the cracks and edges. One of his ears swiveled in her direction as she spoke, picking up on the quiet suggestion. Without a word in response, he gave a sort of upward nod toward a rocky outcropping a short distance from the road that would serve as a natural barrier to have their backs to as they rested.

Once they approached it, he took the time to scan the area for potential threats, parting from her side to do a quick trot of the perimeter. Only once he was satisfied did he return to her side, reaching into his own bag to pull out a prickly pear fruit and a sickle-like knife. Cutting off the ends of the fruit, already stripped of its barbs, he then sliced down the side of the pear, peeling back the fleshy skin and offering out the flesh and seeds to her.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She stayed on her feet, waiting for him to make his rounds and return without incident, before delicately buckling her legs beneath herself to ease down into the still-warm sand. The leg she had been favoring had an obvious injury to blame: a spattering of what looked like burn wounds up one side her hindquarters and its respective leg, with the fur missing from the reddened flesh that was practically one giant, angry looking scab. If she had been particularly vain, she might have mourned that mutilation, if only for the lovely coloration of her dappled, sooty coat when it was fully intact--but she had other things to mourn instead, and it was given no thought at all other than the constant, hot soreness it created. As she eased down, the injured leg did not tuck up under her body along with the rest, but stretched out slightly away from her in an attempt to let it rest in a more neutral position. All the while, the eagle fluttered around as its perch was jostled, bapping the back of her head with its wings more than a few times, though she seemed entirely desensitized to that.

She had turned to eye her leg a bit pensively a moment, but looked back over as she was offered the cut of fruit. 

&quot;... Thank you,&quot; she murmured softly, reaching to accept it. The gratitude was earnest, but a certain presence of life was missing from her expression all the same. Still, she brought it to her lips to nibble on it; she had no appetite, but she knew refusing to eat was not an option presently.

As she swallowed her first bite, she glanced back up towards the masked male. &quot;... I can take him out and... try to find a hare or the like, if you&#39;d prefer meat yourself,&quot; she offered. He&#39;d seen her prowess with a bow countless times, there was no doubting her ability to hunt... except for the fact that she had a bag leg at present, and... no bow in her possession. 

But if she&#39;d had to choose between keeping the bow or keeping the eagle, she was glad it was the eagle who stayed with her.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Drawing in a deep breath, she finished her cut of the fruit in as timely a manner as she could, wiping off her hands, and carefully--somewhat awkwardly--pushing back to her feet again, eliciting a displeased whistle from the jostled eagle in the process. 

Her arm pivoted to the side, and the bird seemed to understand this communication without issue, fluidly stepping to perch on her forearm instead. His talons fully encircled her limb, and any handler would be borderline insane to hold such a bird without so much as a glove--but she either <em>was</em> a bit insane, or the raptor was unusually mindful of his potentially lethal grip, enough for the centaur to be unfazed at the arrangement. 

She carefully limped a few paces out from the little shelter they had only just begun to settle in, though she barely strayed more than fifteen feet from her companion before slowing to a halt again. She looked around the jagged rocks surrounding their position, ears on a swivel as she tried to ascertain the most likely place something small would be hiding. It took her a moment to remember that even if she spotted something, she could do nothing with that knowledge without her bow. Her fingers unfurled and furled again once on the arm under the eagle, before she turned her gaze to the bird. Murmuring a soft word to it, she held it away from her body, ears reflexively tucking flat as those large wings spread, narrowly avoiding clocking her in the temple as the beast took flight. 

She stayed standing there, her expression all but empty as she watched his shape grow smaller and smaller in the dying light of the sky, gaining altitude until he was able to coast more effortlessly on the air currents high above. She simply stood there for a while, even after she began to struggle to maintain vision on the bird, just... silently lost in thought. 

And then her attention abruptly snapped to the side, her body tensing slightly as she looked down towards the road they had just departed from--and a mere heartbeat later, Rahul, too, would be able to hear the distant sound of a familiar rhythm that hinted at a single, hooved creature galloping closer.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Faster, it seemed, than was typical for a horse. Or a centaur, for that matter. 

When the incoming creature came into sight, it was certainly moving unusually fast--and it didn&#39;t appear to be a completely mundane entity, either. It moved like a horse--it seemed to resemble some sort of equine--but it left trails of faint, golden light streaking through the air behind it, a phenomenon which lingered long after it had continued onward. 

But as they got sight of this approaching entity, it also seemed to get sight of them. Or more specifically--its rider did. It was a figure shrouded entirely in black, with no discerning features visible, unless you counted the relatively wide brim of a hat, from which a black fabric hung that entirely concealed the rider&#39;s head. Upon seeming to notice the two centaurs, the steed&#39;s incredible momentum immediately began to slow; by the time it had reached the road closest to the place where the centaurs had detoured to make camp, it had settled to a walk, and then halted. 

With the rider truly, fully concealed in fluttering black fabrics and veils, the horse--or what mostly resembled a horse--was the only thing that had much in the way of discernable features to it. Its body was slick and inky black, not appearing to be furred at all. Its mane and tail were a dark silver coloration, and from the roots of those silver hairs--as well as the soles beneath each hoof, and the voids within its nostrils and what should have been eyes--originated those warm streaks of light, which still left lingering trails through the air, even as its movements stilled. The color resembled that of an ember, golds and oranges and the occasional flash of a white shimmer or a red undercurrent. Despite the speed it had been traveling at, the beast--whose head stood in stark contrast to its dark body as it was comprised of something resembling polished ivory, in the shape of something reminiscent of a dragonoid skull more than anything equine--did not pant for breath. It did not appear to breathe at all.

But neither steed nor rider advanced upon the centaurs from the beaten path they followed, and only a moment or two of silence passed, before a voice rose from the rider; distinctly feminine, and notably... soft. Despite the altogether rather intimidating presentation, the voice was a gentle one. 

&quot;... Apologies,&quot; it spoke, in near perfect taurish. &quot;I do not mean to frighten you. I was not expecting to encounter others along this trail.&quot; A beat, though it was impossible to tell where the rider&#39;s gaze had wandered behind its veils. &quot;... You are injured?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

With naturally light, quiet movements, she dismounted the strange steed--stranger, still, as its form swirled and shifted once her feet were solidly on the ground, until its shape had changed entirely into that of an owl, which nimbly swooped in the air to come to perch on the figure&#39;s shoulder. In a smooth movement, the rider&#39;s hands lifted as if to pull back a hood. This seemed illogical, given that the garments concealing her head should not have operated as such--and yet, in the easy and fluid movement of her hands, the veils and even the shape of her hat shifted back and down away from her face in a manner that seemed to directly disrespect physics, resulting in a soft scarf-like pile of black fabric gathered around her shoulders. 

The woman appeared elven in heritage, though what kind of elf was a bit hard to say. She had the bronze-tinted complexion of a native to the desert, and rich brown hair that fell in soft waves down around her shoulders. Her eyes were a sleepy blue color, and... resembled a tieflings&#39;, almost, in that they had no discernable sclera, nor pupil. Just a solid, albeit pretty, grey-blue color. 

She was easygoing in her approach, keeping her hands visible to the centaurs and taking her time carefully picking across the rough footing to get to their location, slowing to a halt when she was still about ten feet away from them. 

Her gaze wandered to Jazirah&#39;s leg, a soft knit of her brows betraying more of that quiet concern as she studied the injury. &quot;... I would not expect you to trust the touch of a stranger&#39;s magic. Which is just as well, as I am not well versed in healing magics. However, I have supplies that should be nearly as good, but... the nature of the wound may complicate that ever so slightly.&quot; 

She looked to Rahul, then, as he was the one who seemed to be deciding where the boundaries were. &quot;... I can offer you a healing potion that will undoubtedly help matters. But that looks old enough that I worry about infection, especially if you have been traveling this land with it like this.&quot; She did not, however, sound judgmental about that; after all, if they didn&#39;t have the means to travel with it in any other way, that couldn&#39;t be helped. &quot;I do have supplies that could further assist in that case, but you would have to humor me with tolerating a bit of strange magic as I retrieved them. I can communicate my actions to you prior to taking any if it would reassure you.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1106828817714135070 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1106828817714135070><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, May 12, 2023 11:22 PM">11:22 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-spoiler chatlog__markdown-spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"> owl is canon, appearance is... prrrrobably canon. idk, i may change my mind later but we&#39;re going with that for now. </span></span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1106786817816145980/1106828817080778752/5cab521c5129420ec0ad4b6c905b5e17.png?ex=65585829&amp;is=6545e329&amp;hm=2ecb6b5690f12bc6dc265a68b13d9884fa41c387b410ac64e94a24b2db7cbcb5&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1106786817816145980/1106828817080778752/5cab521c5129420ec0ad4b6c905b5e17.png?ex=65585829&amp;is=6545e329&amp;hm=2ecb6b5690f12bc6dc265a68b13d9884fa41c387b410ac64e94a24b2db7cbcb5&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: 5cab521c5129420ec0ad4b6c905b5e17.png (573.02 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1106786817816145980/1106828817462472714/AmunetGuiseNoHeadpiece.png?ex=65585829&amp;is=6545e329&amp;hm=2a1bdfefb3582d8445ec643c6bab08873328b51b202266c7db809c1273771607&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1106786817816145980/1106828817462472714/AmunetGuiseNoHeadpiece.png?ex=65585829&amp;is=6545e329&amp;hm=2a1bdfefb3582d8445ec643c6bab08873328b51b202266c7db809c1273771607&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: AmunetGuiseNoHeadpiece.png (228.83 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

The elf seemed understanding of that. &quot;It is not something I have noticed is commonly needed amongst your people, so that is likely to be expected.&quot; She paused a moment, seeming to consider how best to explain herself.

&quot;We currently stand on the material plane. Everything you have likely known is within the realm of the material plane. But there are other... <em>iterations</em> of this existence. It can be very confusing to wrap your mind around for the first time, so I will not try to inundate you with dense details; the important information is that a demiplane is a pocket of existence that does not take up space anywhere on the material plane. It is...&quot; She squinted a little, her head tipping as she seemed to turn her gaze skyward, towards the dense scattering of stars becoming visible in the dying light. 

&quot;While not a truly accurate way of describing it, perhaps it is best to think of it as using the space between the stars, instead of anywhere in the world around us presently. Magic that interacts with such spaces is like a portal that can be created in front of you or I, which leads to a little corner of existence, a private room between the stars, only accessible from that created portal. While that sounds grand--and it certainly <em>can</em> be--this can also function on a very small scale. The most common use of a demiplane is items typically referred to as bags of holding; a bag that, simply put, is able to store far, far more than its size and shape suggests it should be able to hold. Because it is not quite a bag, but instead acts as a portal to a larger demiplane space where the items are safely stored.&quot;

She lifted a hand slightly, though nothing visually happened. &quot;I have one such enchantment within my sleeves. I must reach into it to retrieve the healing potion, which is stored in such a demiplane space. But if something more specialized is ultimately required to treat your companion&#39;s injury--or any of your own that are not readily visible to me at this moment--I will have to access another demiplane. This other demiplane is not a simple storage container, but is a very large shelter that I sleep in while I am traveling. It provides a near-endless supply of food, water, and all other amenities, and is the safest place one can be, as it is impossible to enter it without my specific access granted. I would have summoned this shelter for myself further up the road, but if you wish it, I can do so here, instead, and allow both of you to share in that shelter for the night.&quot;

As she spoke, she reached into the sleeve of her lifted hand, her movement easy and slow enough to be unalarming. Without any shimmer of magic or visual effect, her hand withdrew again, simply holding a glass vial of a blood-red liquid, as if it had somehow been stored in her sleeve all along. 

&quot;I regret to say this is the only one of these <em>particular</em> kinds of supplies I have on hand,&quot; she continued, taking a few minimal steps forward to offer the vial out to Rahul, &quot;But I have numerous resources of alternative varieties if this is not sufficient.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The liquid inside betrayed itself to <em>not</em> be the blood it resembled in the subtle golden shimmers that stirred about as it shifted, and the smell was pleasantly earthy.

Jazirah reached out to take it, giving it a brief sniff herself, but finding nothing more wrong with it than Rahul had. She took a tiny sip of it at first, and when the (slightly bitter, but not necessarily foul) flavor was as recognizable and unproblematic as the smell had been, she drank the rest of it as well. 

Wiping her finger across her lips, she exhaled slowly, feeling the gentle warmth of magical healing tingle through her marred body. She glanced over her shoulder, observing the burns on her leg as she tested her weight on that hoof gingerly. Over the next several seconds, a good amount of the angry redness eased back from the ugly scabs... but it did not erase the injury entirely. Still, Jazirah&#39;s posture gradually shifted, allowing more weight to rest on that leg as her experimental shifting allowed her to do so with a reduced threshold for pain. It wasn&#39;t perfect, but it was an improvement.

She looked back to the elf then, some of the apprehension and caution having similarly eased out of her posture in the wake of proven generosity from the stranger. It was hard to continue to hold the natural suspicions she was braced with in the face of genuine assistance, as it would have made little sense for the woman to offer such a valuable resource if she meant them harm.

&quot;... That is better. Thank you,&quot; Jazirah murmured softly, carefully stepping forward (showing, in doing so, that there was still a limp remaining--notably reduced from what it had been, but present all the same) to hand the empty vial back. 

The elf smiled softly, reaching to take it and tuck it out of sight again. &quot;Of course. Though it does not seem to have cured as much as I had hoped it might,&quot; she regretted, eyeing the lingering scabs and redness. &quot;... Does it feel hot beneath the skin?&quot;

&quot;Somewhat,&quot; the centaur replied quietly, glancing back to her leg again. &quot;We have not had anything to properly dress it with. Most of our supplies were lost several days ago. It is likely infected.&quot; Something she had not wanted to speak into existence when they had no means of solving that problem--but if this woman could provide such means, Jazirah had no reason to avoid the words. 

The elf nodded. &quot;I should be able to assist with that further, if you will both permit it. But I will not force the matter if I am overstaying my welcome,&quot; she assured gently, looking back to Rahul&#39;s more stern gaze.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She turned slightly to appraise the land immediately around them, searching for something, or perhaps gauging an ideal location for her next moves. &quot;I will need to create an entrance to the second demiplane I mentioned to access the rest of my things. I am only able to do this once tonight, and as it is where I rest for the night when I am traveling, that necessitates me spending the night here. Well... at least, with the magical entrance to my true location rooted here, anyways. You are both welcome to join me within it, and I should be able to demonstrate to you the safety it offers. You will also be freely able to leave at any time, if you choose it, so I do not want to create the impression you will be confined against your will.&quot; As she spoke, she seemed to find whatever she had been looking for, and one hand--both of which were gloved in black leathers--dipped into her sleeve once more, this time pulling forth what looked to be a shard of polished, marbled ivory, small enough to comfortably fit in her grasp. 

&quot;It is a sanctum of my own personal creation and design,&quot; she continued, reaching out to place the shard in front of her, where it... just hovered motionlessly in midair as her hand left it, as if she had stuck it in something unseen. &quot;As such... I rather believe it to be a peaceful, comforting shelter. It utilizes a great deal of open spaces, but I do not imagine either of you have extensive experience within walled and rooved structures--so I do apologize if that creates any discomfort. While this magic would normally allow the caster to redesign the shelter with each new casting, mine is set up as a permanent fixture that continues to exist even after my more temporary entrance to it has expired, and so I do not have the ability to easily change its design.&quot;

She turned back to offer the two centaurs another gentle smile. &quot;But even if the surroundings are strange to you, it is a place of peace and safety. Nothing within will ever pose a threat to you; the entire space is an extension of myself. I--&quot;

She was cut off as a massive shape struck down nearly on top of her, and the elf barely caught herself, a reflexive shimmer of magic momentarily shrouding her form to protect from the unknown assailant. But the magic faded promptly and the elf regained her footing, stepping aside and pivoting to face the harpy eagle who had dive-bombed her--or, rather, the much smaller bird that had been perched on her shoulder. But the eagle only had continued upward from its dive to pluck the owl up for a few wingbeats, before the owl--looking bedraggled and alarmed in those <em>enormous</em> talons--simply... vanished, as if its physical matter had wisped away into an evanescent mist. The eagle&#39;s talons flexed down over the space its prey had occupied a moment prior, a clear confusion and frustration setting in at the illogicality of that prey now missing, as it&#39;s head tilted to sweep its gaze over the ground below. But the owl was thoroughly gone.

The elf blinked at that a moment... but the unique features of the eagle, the noteworthy patterns in its coloration, dawned a realization in her eyes, and she--actually chuckled in surprised amusement, looking back to the centaurs. 

&quot;... Your friend, I take it?&quot;

Jazirah was tight-lipped, and looked mildly horrified--and unsure what to make of the woman&#39;s easy shrugging off of the assassination of her pet. &quot;... I. Apologize.&quot;

&quot;No need. My name is Amunet--and that <em>was</em> Kemet. But she will be Kemet again once I am able to summon her back. She was never flesh and blood, unfortunately for your companion.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Only that as I am Forsworn, I have a duty to protect what remains of my herd, and I cannot personally guarantee her safety on the word of someone we just met, no matter how kind or generous.&quot;

He did not give his name, for it was unnecessary. He was Forsworn. That was his function, his purpose.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The medical supplies, I can bring out to you, yes. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for food or drink; though it will fill your belly as surely as any other substance, it tends to vanish if otherwise removed from the premises. But you may change your mind at any time. Or not; I take no offense, and merely wish to explain what options will be available. But the medical supplies are a simpler matter, so allow me a moment to fetch those.&quot;

She pivoted back to face the shard of marbled ivory suspended in midair, and with a delicate and seemingly innocuous wave of her hand, a warm, white shimmer of light subtly flashed over a plane of space centered on that shard. &quot;I will leave this entrance open while I fetch the supplies, if you are curious to look in without actually entering the space. Otherwise, excuse me for a moment; I shouldn&#39;t be long.&quot;

With that, her hand gently swept through the air, as if brushing aside a curtain. And as if, in fact, an unseen curtain had been brushed aside, a portal appeared where the &quot;curtain&quot; had previously covered, as if Amunet had brushed aside a veil of reality to reveal something extraplanar peeking through. If inspected at all, the centaurs would find that this visual phenomenon was two-dimensional externally, with no thickness to it whatsoever (the entrance visually disappeared if viewed from the exact side--or if viewed from the back at all; only viewing it from the front allowed sight inward). 

And yet, the space that had been revealed behind this incorporeal curtain was <em>fully</em> dimensional. It entirely defied physics--but portals typically did by way of existing at all. The environment from within the portal, which Amunet stepped through to as easily as passing any more mundane threshold, was a cozily-lit hall, such as what might have been seen in a palace&#39;s throne room. Instead of leading to a throne, however, it led to a wide staircase at the end opposite the portal, which reached to a landing, and then split off into two additional sets of stairs branching in opposite directions; one to the left and one to the right. These seemed to imply a path to a second floor, though it was hard to ascertain what that second floor was like, as the ceiling of this parlor room was a good twenty or thirty feet high. What <em>could</em> be seen from outside, however, were a few wide archways decorating the sides of the hall, each equipped with an elegant, royal blue curtain, and each curtain tied back to allow easy access to the rooms beyond. As they watched, Amunet would head towards the stairs, scaling the first set, and then turning to continue to climb up the stairs leading to the right, before she disappeared from the view of the portal.


Jazirah might have been a little alarmed by such magic, had the woman not established herself (in her eyes, at least) as likely being of good intent and friendly disposition. So instead, her wide eyes simply took it all in, waiting until Amunet was halfway down the parlor within, before curiosity got the better of her, and she took a few careful steps around the side of the portal to soak in the optical illusion it created.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Awe-inspiring. But so far outside the realm of what he&#39;d known.

But it was thanks to this magic that Jazirah was getting the help she needed, and so he found it within himself to tolerate and even slightly appreciate its usefulness. Still, he shifted uneasily, one hoof pawing at the ground, his curly-haired tail swishing.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

During this time, the harpy eagle seemed to give up on his futile searching for his lost quarry, and returned to perch on Jazirah&#39;s back, looking a little grumpy. 

Jazirah was... sullen, the last few days. And understandably so. Their world had been turned upside down in a nauseating way. But it was clear she had far fewer innate reservations about this turn of events than Rahul did. 

After experimentally poking at the borders of the magic (wherein nothing notable seemed to happen as a result, her touch sliding through it like thin air), she glanced over her shoulder towards her companion again.

&quot;... If she has food... maybe we can just... go in long enough to eat? Haroun doesn&#39;t seem to be having much luck in these mountains,&quot; she offered faintly, practically whispering. &quot;We don&#39;t have to sleep in there if it&#39;s unwise, but... what reason could she possibly have for wanting to do us harm? Those potions are not easily obtained... wouldn&#39;t it be strange for her to waste one just to earn our trust if her aim was sinister...?&quot; 

Despite the tentative curiosity and optimism, her hushed words were not argumentative. There was an open-endedness to them that still deeply respected Rahul&#39;s judgment, and she would likely abide by whatever it was. She certainly would not challenge his judgment in front of a stranger. But in this brief moment... she couldn&#39;t help but wonder at the options laid before them.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She looked back to the portal, gingerly reaching her arm through it again. There was no sensory effect to doing so, and no visual disturbance to her touch. Just like moving her hand through the threshold of any walkway. 

&quot;... Perhaps knowing more about her will alleviate worries of her intent. The reason she knows our language may be reassuring to hear.&quot; A beat. &quot;...

She looked to her fingers, still hovering over the portal’s threshold. Then, very gingerly, she began to inch forward, her body stretching carefully until her upper torso was through the portal, with the rest of her body remaining outside, her hind legs rooted as firmly as possible in the craggy earth as if she would be in danger of slipping and falling inside. 

She twisted her head to look back through the portal she had partially crossed, ears that had been flat as if to avoid brushing any upper boundary of the entrance now flicking forward in careful curiosity. She looked around herself a moment, before delicately withdrawing again, taking several steps back. 

“I can see through from the inside as easily as we can see into it now,” she reported. “The only thing that feels different inside is that the air is cooler, like standing in the shade. There are faint sounds of things quietly stirring from far off that I only began to hear when my head was through. It’s very strange… but…”

She drifted off with a minute shrug as the image of Amunet came back into sight, as she appeared at the top of the right branch of stairs and smoothly made her way down to the ground floor, crossing the hall again to step through the exit once more.

“Apologies for the wait; I had to reference some records regarding what materials would be best to fetch. I am not the <em>most</em> adept in medical studies, but I make do.”

She reached out to offer to the centaurs a roll of soft cloth bandages, a glass jar containing an ivory-colored ointment, and a vial of liquid that resembled a sort of tea. As she handed each over, she explained, “The liquid is primarily comprised of lavender and calendula, to help cleanse the wound. The ointment is a mixture including things such as honey, garlic, yarrow, myrrh, and echinacea, which should promote healing and further purification. I would use the liquid first, and then apply the ointment, wrapping bandages over it when you have done so.” A beat, before she added, “You are, of course, welcome to come inside of you would like to rinse the wounds with plain water first, as I have ample spaces for bathing that will be easily accommodating to your bodies. However, I still take no offense if you desire to stay out here, and you should have your needs met sufficiently without the use of water.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His shoulders slumped faintly in resignation, though he still took the time to smell and taste the ointment and the liquid, to confirm they were made up of what she said they were. After a short period, he murmured, &quot;...Very well. We will go inside with you.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Come, then; if you ever change your mind, the entrance will remain right where it currently is. Just as I cannot presently reshape this sanctum to make it more innately centaur-friendly, I cannot change the nature of the portal. However, I will conceal it externally once we are inside, making it impossible to detect for any who wander this area—and in doing so, you will not be able to plainly see back through the portal to the desert. However, the functionality will remain for the next twenty-four hours, and for better or for worse, I cannot alter that.”

She turned to step back into the portal, standing aside to give them room to follow. Within was how Jazirah described; pleasantly cool in its atmosphere, and though there were no noteworthy sounds greeting them, it was clear that sound did not travel through the portal, as it was like stepping into a bubble of an entirely insulated ambiance.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She led them up the stairs, once again taking the route to the right, and slowing her pace to not leave them behind as they navigated the obstacle. Jazirah walked near to Rahul as they crossed the hall, her shoulder lightly brushing his hip at times as she looked around the space with clear intrigue. The ceiling was high, something not easy to take in from the outside of the portal, and it had a slightly domed structure to it, with continuations of ivory pillars that were rooted symmetrically along the hall arcing to meet at the peak of this dome, like ribs joining at a spine.

The stairs were a little ungainly at first, especially with Jazirah&#39;s limp--but not impossible to master. It just took a bit of careful, thoughtful footing. It was some measure of comfort, too, to have each flight of stairs a length that could theoretically be jumped down to clear them in a hurried exit, though such a landing on unyielding stone floors would probably be unpleasant.

At the landing halfway up the stairs, and better still at the top of the upper flight of stairs, they would be able to see more of the second floor, both where they were headed, as well as glimpses towards the stairs that had led to the left. The latter led to a short path that simply... ended in a door, the first door they had seen in a space that was otherwise just continuously open walkways. This door was closed, and was beautifully carved of ivory, with golden accents. At the center of the door, at about eye level, the carvings of the door that were otherwise mostly decorative instead took the more deliberate shape of what appeared to be an elegant pot, with its opening tilted downwards, and the likeness of water pouring from within and snaking down the rest of the door&#39;s carvings like the roots of a tree made possible by a gorgeous blue gem of some sort, inlaid into the ivory.

&quot;If I may ask one thing of you; please do not explore the western wing,&quot; Amunet noted, nodding towards this door if they looked towards it. &quot;It houses more of my personal matters. The rest of this space, however, is yours to poke and prod at to your hearts&#39; content.&quot;

Continuing towards the path opposite the noted western door, Amunet led them into a large, comfortable-looking room, with a slightly recessed pit in the center of the floor, densely populated with rugs and pillows and luxuriously draping curtains of largely dark blue fabrics. The ceiling was high, likely a good forty feet up, though it was hard to say exactly, as it was a slightly mesmerizing blanket of stars and planets. While not looking the same as the natural night sky would, it seemed to act as an elaborate orrery, with the position of planets held by spheres in the likeness of those celestial bodies, scaled to fit comfortably within the space. Several constellations could be noted behind and around them, certainly following the arrangement of the true night sky, but there was a manner of three-dimensionality to the display, with some of the planets and moons and stars closer to those who stood on the floor, and some farther away, which gave it more of a surreal presentation.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1108581113758236913 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1108581113758236913><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 17, 2023 7:25 PM">7:25 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;This is <em>Caer Aleaza</em>; the closest thing I have ever had to a true home and place of safety.

It was vaguely humanoid, but had a very construct-like manner of anatomy, made entirely of polished ivory and pale marble. If it was capable of speaking, it said nothing, merely standing with its hands neatly folded in front of it.

&quot;Do not be concerned with the appearance of these servants; they are not creatures of their own, but merely an extension of this sanctum. Whatever you request of them, such as food, drink, supplies, or the like, they will deliver to you. You may even request specific foods; <em>Caer Aleaza</em> is capable of producing anything you desire to eat. Any form of direct dismissal will have these servants depart from your presence again--Thank you, that is all,&quot; she added, a touch more softly, to the figure that had taken shape. In response, it silently dipped its head, before its form seemed to lose tangibility, and rapidly wisped away through the air like smoke.

&quot;The sanctum will listen if you call for its assistance--but it has no memory of its own. So rest assured, this does not permit any manner of eavesdropping; whatever you speak is not retained, unless heard by myself, my familiar, or my homunculus, wherever she has gotten off to.

In many ways, they are similar to familiars. Kemet--the owl that your own friend fancied making a meal out of--is my familiar. I created her through simple conjuring magics, and I will summon the same entity back as she previously was while you two take your baths. But homunculi are created less with conjuration, and more with transmutation; they are sculpted from mundane materials and infused with drops of the caster&#39;s blood, and they are, consequentially, very much extensions of the mage&#39;s own self. Like a familiar, I can only have one homunculus at a time. Unlike a familiar, I cannot summon my homunculus back if she is killed; I must create one anew. And if I were to die, my homunculus would die, as well. But while Kemet travels with me in the world beyond this sanctum, my homunculus--Amara--remains here in my sanctum, and helps manage and monitor things in my absence. Amara, dear--do come greet our guests; I&#39;ve talked about you more than enough by now,&quot; she added, directing the words out towards the room at large. 

With a smooth stride that had clearly been in motion from before her presence had been requested, an exceptionally unique creature padded into the room from one of the many archways in the surrounding walls. Weaving around a pillar, the creature was a little smaller than the bodies of the centaurs, but larger than the average dog; she had a body that looked highly flexible, with front legs that more closely resembled humanoid arms than any bestial limbs, even ending in hands that padded comfortably across the stone floors and rugs. Behind these forelimbs, an extra pair of much smaller limbs were nestled cozily, tucked against her ribs in a vaguely mantis-like position. She had a long, elegant tail, and a similarly long neck, which might have looked serpentine were it not for the ruff of long, narrow feathers decorating it, and framing the mostly humanoid face at its top. She could almost be said to have had horns, but instead of two separate growths, they seemed to join at the tips, creating a singular, halo-like circle that crowned over her head. 

The sphinx&#39;s eyes were sharp and angular, and she had a flat nose, with an upper jaw sharply defined from the lower. These features greeted the centaurs with a placid smile and a soft dip of her head, and when she spoke, her voice was like a series of melodic sighs. &quot;Welcome to you both. I am at your service.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1108588360798306415 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1108588360798306415><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 17, 2023 7:54 PM">7:54 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-spoiler chatlog__markdown-spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"> : ) </span></span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1106786817816145980/1108588360496320513/Amunets_Amara.png?ex=655ebedd&amp;is=654c49dd&amp;hm=a0e63f3e27673a003b54feb157f8315f365ede5367909139347090a4146174bc&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1106786817816145980/1108588360496320513/Amunets_Amara.png?ex=655ebedd&amp;is=654c49dd&amp;hm=a0e63f3e27673a003b54feb157f8315f365ede5367909139347090a4146174bc&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: Amunets_Amara.png (745.29 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;That just about concludes any living or seemingly-living thing you would find within this sanctum,&quot; Amunet mused, looking back to the centaurs. &quot;So you should not encounter any sort of surprise creature. And Amara will stay out of your way unless you need her for something. Come--let me show you to the baths,&quot; she continued, gesturing for them to follow as she headed off again, moving through one of the archways flaking the large room they had been standing in.

A short walk later brought them to a room with even more dusky lighting, almost as if the room was lit solely by moonlight. Moonlight, and the soft glow of golden accents throughout--most notably, in the form of fish. 

As they entered, they stood upon one of the only places within this room that was not underwater; a platform of stone tile that, after a few paces from the doorway, transitioned into a series of wide, downward steps which were largely underwater. The water was crystal clear and absolutely beautiful in the soft light of the space, with a bottom that could be seen to be only four, maybe five feet at the deepest. Within this water--which stretched to the entire rest of the room, interrupted only by exotic flora that grew at the edges--a few fish could be seen lazily swimming about, seemingly of different varieties, but all emitting the gentlest glow of warm, rippling light. 

There was no natural ceiling in this room, either; instead, a more accurate depiction of the night sky was made abstract by strange, celestial shapes seeming to swim through those stars as lazily as the fish glided through the water. The creatures above were harder to make sense of than the fish, as they did not give off innate light, nor did they seem to be colored like mundane animals, but if watched for long enough, shapes that resembled crocodiles and smaller shapes like fish could be gleaned.

&quot;Nothing in this room, save for us, is alive,&quot; Amunet noted, gesturing to the water and the strange stars above. &quot;These are not living creatures, but a part of the d&#233;cor. Much of the rooms in this sanctum are either designed after places I have been, or dreams I have been given. This room would account for one of the latter. But that aside; the water is enchanted, in that any dirt washed from yourselves will be magically cleansed out of the water, so that you are not soaking in a soup of your own sweat and such. The temperature should be agreeable, but you may ask <em>Caer Aleaza</em> to adjust it to your preferences. I will have towels sent over to be made available for you for when you are finished. Is there anything else I can assist with before I leave you to your privacy?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1108597966392008714 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1108597966392008714><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 17, 2023 8:32 PM">8:32 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-spoiler chatlog__markdown-spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"> vibe delivery </span></span></div><div class="chatlog__attachment chatlog__attachment--hidden" onclick=showSpoiler(event,this)><div class=chatlog__attachment-spoiler-caption>SPOILER</div><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1106786817816145980/1108597965674790943/SPOILER_075f908a12d1a3eef560e8bd39087fef.png?ex=655ec7cf&amp;is=654c52cf&amp;hm=e0be3bd480e2d7391271d59ad9968d5e2ff412b43177c6bc4d3b06d7bdec624f&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1106786817816145980/1108597965674790943/SPOILER_075f908a12d1a3eef560e8bd39087fef.png?ex=655ec7cf&amp;is=654c52cf&amp;hm=e0be3bd480e2d7391271d59ad9968d5e2ff412b43177c6bc4d3b06d7bdec624f&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: SPOILER_075f908a12d1a3eef560e8bd39087fef.png (730.63 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div><div class="chatlog__attachment chatlog__attachment--hidden" onclick=showSpoiler(event,this)><div class=chatlog__attachment-spoiler-caption>SPOILER</div><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1106786817816145980/1108597966022905876/SPOILER_sabin-boykinov-afterlife-exploration-3.png?ex=655ec7cf&amp;is=654c52cf&amp;hm=3138db0983cfe9faa5ff10bf8a7dd8e76d5681f4a43177e1dd69fd9d551d0f35&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1106786817816145980/1108597966022905876/SPOILER_sabin-boykinov-afterlife-exploration-3.png?ex=655ec7cf&amp;is=654c52cf&amp;hm=3138db0983cfe9faa5ff10bf8a7dd8e76d5681f4a43177e1dd69fd9d551d0f35&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: SPOILER_sabin-boykinov-afterlife-exploration-3.png (2.29 MB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

As Rahul paused to set aside his things, Jazirah did the same, a quick buckle undone to loosen the leather harness the eagle had been perched on. Her fur where it had rested was caked in dried sweat and dirt, and compressed against her body, but it was nothing a bit of scrubbing wouldn&#39;t undo. 

But she did not pursue that task. Instead, as she waded through the water until she and Rahul&#39;s lower bodies were almost entirely submerged, she turned to stand with her body alongside his, reaching to run her fingers across his back firmly enough to begin to dislodge some of the mess they had been coated in for almost a week. This process was helped quite a bit by the enchanted waters, which subtly did away with all the dirt and grime that was bled into them as her claws scrubbed gentle, rhythmic lines over his spine and down his lower shoulders. 

&quot;... Try to relax,&quot; she murmured, her words barely more than a whisper. &quot;We weighed our options, and this is the path we chose.

For as strange as their surroundings were, they were at least private, and blissfully quiet, with the ambiance of the water and occasional twist of a fish&#39;s fin against the surface being soothing exceptions to that silence. Even the eagle eventually waddled over to the edge--not to bathe himself, but to lean down and scoop water into his beak, tilting his head back to drink, and repeating this for a long time. They had all been in sore need of the boons of water.

Jazirah&#39;s fingers were gentle as they combed through his mane, more wild and prone to tangles than hers was, given its texture. But though the feature of curls was not one that was--or, rather, had been--found on others within their herd, Jazirah and Rahul had grown up alongside one another, and this was merely one of thousands of times they had run fingers through the other&#39;s mane and tail. She was used to doing it in a way that allowed the curls to collect in their natural groupings, instead of separating the individual strands and creating a chaotic, frizzy puff when dry. By the time she was through with his hair, each curl fell in a neat ripple, tangle-free and washed of dust and blood, slick with the bath water in a way that made them look luxuriously oiled. 

When there was nothing left of Rahul&#39;s hide to scrub clean, and the only signs of the harrowing days behind them were the fresh wounds marring their skin, she finally stepped away again. She didn&#39;t go far, though, merely wading towards the steps until she could reach her discarded harness, where she began the process of scrubbing it clean with the enchanted waters as well, allowing Rahul ample time to doff his mask with her back turned. She knew what his face looked like--she had known him before he had taken his vows--but she innately respected his role and all that came with it, including granting him an obscurity some outsiders would consider pointless.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Fingers worked into the grooves to clear out any impacted grit, and then it was set aside so he could lean forward and dip his face into the water, scrubbing all the sweat and grit from around his eyes and ears.

Once the mask was secured back in place, he turned back around and went to climb out of the water, taking the steps carefully so as not to slip or skid along the floor. The medical supplies were retrieved from the bag, and he waited patiently for Jazirah to finish with her harness that he could start to bandage her now-cleansed wound.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She held the harness out and gave it a little shake to dispel some water droplets, before laying it out to dry. Climbing back out of the water, she gave a hearty shake to do the same with her own coat, her injured leg held a little stiffly off to the side to not jostle it too intensely in the process. 

Taking a deep breath, she let out a long sigh, already feeling a bit better. It always made everything a little easier to manage when you were comfortable in your own skin, and not caked in filth. She paused, her attention shifting to the door as one of the voiceless servants appeared in the entryway, carrying a stack of probably an excessive quantity of plush, clean, folded towels, which were gently deposited on the floor within reach of the centaurs. With that accomplished, the figure dipped its head, and simply disapparated in a wisp of smoke. 

Jazirah stared at that a moment, before limping over to the pile of towels, her upper body bending down to take one off the top of the stack. It smelled wonderful; subtle, but pleasantly clean. Maybe with a hint of lavender. It made it inviting to bury her face in it and begin to dry off the lingering moisture, as she otherwise stood still to allow Rahul access to her leg.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

With one steadying hand on her flank, he poured the liquid onto a corner of the towel and began meticulously dabbing it over the wound, making sure it was clean, and pausing as needed for Jazirah to manage the pain. It was gently patted dry before the ointment was applied, generous with it and making sure it completely covered the wound and the skin around it, finishing up with wrapping it in the clean bandages and securing them snugly.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There was the occasional flinch from Jazirah, but for the most part, she soldiered through the discomfort without squirming. While her leg was tended to, she took the time to towel off the rest of her body--something they didn&#39;t really do much in their normal lives, as there was rarely any harm in just air-drying instead, and towels weren&#39;t often even crafted. But she couldn&#39;t deny how nice it was to not feel drippy at the conclusion of the bath, as that had a way of tickling at her skin and making her want to roll in something (and consequentially undo the benefits of the bath).

As Rahul concluded tying off the bandages, she experimentally lifted and lowered her leg to feel the range of motion the bandages allowed for. 

&quot;... Thank you. I feel better,&quot; she murmured softly. &quot;Like the wound has been able to breathe properly for the first time. It is not so tight and stiff.&quot; Her gaze roamed over his own flank, across the less serious but still present injuries he carried. &quot;Which of yours bother you the most?

The rest had been glancing blows, scratches and scrapes that were already nearly healed beneath the scabbing.

He&#39;d fallen quiet again, more comfortable when he didn&#39;t have to talk. He&#39;d talked more with her this last week than the last several months combined.

She stepped back to look over this arrangement a moment, before seeming to deem it satisfactory, and turning her attention elsewhere again. 

Her harness was dried off with a towel, and then fitted to her back again, where it had clearly been conditioned by the shape of her body over years of use and fit like a glove. With it secured, she gave a soft whistle, and the eagle roused from where he had been idly sitting on the floor, flapping up to return to his usual perch. She gathered up her bag, fastening it back to the side of the harness, and then looked back to Rahul, offering out a hand again in a wordless suggestion to head back out to the previously-traversed rooms, and maybe acquire some of the promised food.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And it was empty--save for the sphinx, who was comfortably lounging on a scattering of pillows near one corner of the room. She looked up as Jazirah and Rahul entered, and gave a gentle dip of her head in greeting, before smoothly rising to her feet, though she did not approach.

&quot;You may request your preference of any food or drink from <em>Caer Aleaza</em>,&quot; she advised, her soft, sleepy hiss somehow reaching them across the space without issue. &quot;Whatever it is, it will be provided. I will fetch my mistress, so you may decide upon sleeping arrangements with her.&quot;

Jazirah&#39;s gait had slowed as they entered the room, less tense than she had been upon first walking through, but still a little unsure what to be doing with herself in such an environment. She gave the sphinx a single nod in reply, looking around a moment, before slowly making her way towards the slightly recessed pit in the floor that was densely populated with pillows. It looked comfy.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

When she had departed, he turned to follow Jazirah to the pillow pit, though he stood guard above the recess rather than descend into it with her.

The thought of food, that he could ask for anything he wanted, prompted some consideration. Though at first he considered the staple dishes of his decimated tribe, he abruptly realized that he could order foods from his native Helasia that he hadn&#39;t had since he was a colt... And moreover, that he could share it with Jazirah.

...There were a lot to choose from. But the ones he missed the most were first upon his lips. &quot;<em>Caer Aleaza.</em> It is my understanding you are capable of providing any manner of food. I would ask for a few things. Helasian goat stew with ugali and sukumawiki, as well as viazi karai, and makai. Is this acceptable?&quot;

Several of those words might have been entirely unfamiliar to Jazirah, but if the magical abode did in fact deliver on the claim of being able to serve absolutely any food, she would learn soon enough.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At Rahul&#39;s words, wisps of a sand-like texture rapidly formed the vaguely humanoid shape of one of the sanctum&#39;s automatons a reasonable speaking distance away from the centaurs. But it did not speak, silently regarding Rahul as he stated his order, before simply dipping its head in acceptance--and then evaporating away again.

About five minutes passed in quiet stillness, where the centaurs remained alone in the room. But that was all the time it took, before two identical automatons appeared not through the same incorporeal means, but simply walking up the stairs from whence they had all arrived. Between them both were carried a small number of decently-sized plates, filled generously with what looked to be not only exactly what he had requested, but some of the finest quality of each ingredient Rahul had ever seen. 

Each dish was neatly set down on a low table near the edge of the pillow-pit, and the smell it brought with it was amazing. This completed, the automatons stepped back, hands neatly folded in front of them.

Jazirah looked over the food with slightly widened eyes, already feeling her mouth water. &quot;... This is from your first home?&quot; She asked gently, glancing to her companion.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

You tear off pieces and dip it into stews or greens.&quot; He gestured to each of the foods as he described them, setting his spear down at his side. &quot;Sukumawiki. Collared greens and kale, braised with onions and tomatoes, seasoned with salt. That is makai, roasted maize rubbed with chili and lemon salt. And the viazi karai is spiced fried potatoes.&quot;

He tore off a piece of ugali and dipped it in the thick stew, using it to scoop up some of the meat and vegetables and popping it into his mouth beneath the mask.

It was a little awkward, but she managed to wiggle along on the floor, shimmying forward on her belly until she was within reach of the table as well (much to the eagle&#39;s continued disgruntlement). Once there, she reached to help herself to a bit of the ugali, mimicking his movements to dip it into the stew before popping it into her mouth. 

&quot;... It&#39;s lovely. We&#39;ll have to learn how to make it, so we can keep enjoying it in the future,&quot; she praised softly, her hunger rearing up and gripping her more prominently now that her body had realized food was actually available. And <em>good</em> food, too. She didn&#39;t waste further breath, graciously tucking in alongside him to enjoy the best meal either of them had eaten in ages. 

About halfway through their dinning, the peaceful silence of their surroundings was ever so faintly stirred by the sound of another approaching figure. Unlike before, though, there was no soft click of boots as Amunet entered the room, as she had changed into an outfit that looked far more comfortable than whatever shroud she had been traveling in--and her feet were now bare. Furthermore, the melanistic owl from before was now perched again on her shoulder, not a scratch on her. But perhaps eyeing the eagle a little warily as they came into eyesight. 

&quot;Oh, good, you&#39;ve sorted out food,&quot; Amunet greeted warmly, her voice pleasantly soft and not at all feeling disruptive in what had otherwise been silence. &quot;Would you be opposed to my company as you eat?

They deserved to be able to rest and enjoy this. Whatever happened, they&#39;d deal with it when it did, but for now, he was enjoying himself. Especially as he lifted the makai beneath his mask to bite the maize off the cob and savored all of the tastes flooding his tongue.

...If they stayed for more than one meal, he would have to think on what other dishes he wanted.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Oh, this all looks wonderful. I admit, I didn&#39;t expect to see a Helasian dish in front of you two, given where we met.&quot; She paused, eyeing Haroun, who was in turn eyeing the familiar she had just spent a non-insignificant amount of time summoning back. 

Turning her head towards the automatons standing off to the side, she murmured, &quot;Will you fetch some fresh quail meat--uncooked--for our third guest here, please? And glasses of water for all of us. I think I&#39;d also like some chamomile tea as well. Thank you.&quot;

As the figures disappeared to carry out her requests, she turned back to the food in front of them. She had fully intended to arrange her own meal, but there was plenty of this to go around, and if they seemed willing to share, she was curious to try whatever they had specifically requested. Brushing her sleeves up to her elbows, she reached to help herself to a bit of the ugali, as Jazirah had. 

&quot;Goodness, it&#39;s been many years since I&#39;ve had this. What an unexpected treat.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Such a simple food, yet it manages to be so comforting.&quot; She exhaled contentedly, glancing to Jazirah. &quot;Do you both share these origins, then?&quot;

Jazirah had been (politely) stuffing her face, but paused as she was addressed, swallowing and shaking her head. &quot;No. I am originally from Cusai.&quot; A beat, where she almost seemed a little unsure of what to say here. &quot;This food is new to me.&quot;

Amunet did not pry further, simply nodding. &quot;I trust the supplies were well suited for your wounds?&quot;

Jazirah gave a small nod. &quot;Yes. Thank you.&quot;

A moment passed, before the servants returned; this time, one carefully managed to carry three empty glasses and a tall pitcher of cool water, whereas the other carried a (smaller) plate filled with scraps of raw meat, and a teacup and saucer in its other hand. The glasses and pitcher were carefully set on the available space of the table, the tea in front of Amunet, and the plate of meat aside on the floor; nearly before the servant had released its grasp on it, Haroun had already pounced on it with a slight clatter resulting, beginning to horf down the food.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Well. My next destination may be of immediate interest to you.&quot; She brushed off her hands, and with a graceful gesture, magic swirled to life above her upturned palm, creating an illusory image of a map. 

&quot;We are currently here--at least, we will be when we exist this sanctum,&quot; she stated, using her other hand to point to a spot on the illustration. &quot;Up is north; the majority of the deserts are behind us, to the east over here. Helasia, to help orient you, would be over here. I am headed <em>here</em>,&quot; she continued, her finger moving slightly left of their current location, but a good ways up from it.

&quot;It is very much not the desert--but the winters there are still relatively mild. It is a forested land, but not far enough into the mountains that the land is not still mostly flat, or rolling hills at worst. But what may appeal to you about it is the town I am headed to specifically; a place called Fielbarry, well within the center of the country it is a part of, which consequentially sees a healthy amount of trade and travelers. This has created a...&quot; She paused, considering an apt translation into taurish. 

&quot;... A colorful neighborhood, I suppose, full of all different walks of life. It is far from the most densely populated place I have been, and the city is not walled in as some are. The buildings just sort of... fade at the edges, with more and more space between them the farther you get from the center of town, before the forest ultimately takes over entirely. All things considered, I believe it to be a very safe place. It is civilized by mankind enough that there are no notable threats in the wildlife or wilderness surrounding the town, and I would hazard to presume that you would find the people there much more welcoming and warm than any you may have encountered or traded with in the desert, though I don&#39;t know your precise experiences, of course.&quot;

As she spoke, the image over her palm changed; instead of a map, it now displayed a lush, verdant forest, with trees that grew a comfortable distance apart from one another, and only the faintest glimpses of a cabin or something similar in the tiny distance. 

&quot;I believe it does snow in the winter, but not anything too fiercely. Your coats will likely thicken up on their own and ward off the worst of it, especially if you utilize shelter in town. If I&#39;m not mistaken, I <em>have</em> seen a centaur milling about there on occasion, though I have not been back to Fielbarry in some time.&quot;

She gave a mild shrug, her demeanor very easygoing as she looked back at Rahul. &quot;Just south of this area, the forests are more sparse, and the land is largely open plains and moors. So if you did end up finding the town too much for your preferences, there is a large expanse of land sometimes used by men for farming, but largely not inhabited by humanoids at all, with few predators and threats beyond some foxes, coyotes, or snakes. Being more south, of course, the winters are even more mild, though in either case of what I have explained, it will, of course, not be quite as dry as you&#39;re presumably used to. But both options are full of rich, fertile land that is ripe with resources to be gathered, and fairly welcoming townsfolk who are amenable to trade. Even when droughts affect these lands, the towns tend to source their water from glacial runoffs that form rivers here and there, which I&#39;ve never known to completely dry up.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1112589762272952340 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1112589762272952340><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, May 28, 2023 8:54 PM">8:54 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-spoiler chatlog__markdown-spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"> Amunet&#39;s slideshow </span></span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1106786817816145980/1112589761463464026/GettyImages-499689946.png?ex=655ad876&amp;is=65486376&amp;hm=5922658c78b28159a451f936fabc5599569e7d924185ff4c36af3b17e3b698f2&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1106786817816145980/1112589761463464026/GettyImages-499689946.png?ex=655ad876&amp;is=65486376&amp;hm=5922658c78b28159a451f936fabc5599569e7d924185ff4c36af3b17e3b698f2&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: GettyImages-499689946.png (719.44 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1106786817816145980/1112589761941618738/iStock-147989111-840x475.png?ex=655ad876&amp;is=65486376&amp;hm=3e18e811f91ac0b621ab424f5164f0a19e02b68ab63e0aae14d4a887b1a8d1f9&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1106786817816145980/1112589761941618738/iStock-147989111-840x475.png?ex=655ad876&amp;is=65486376&amp;hm=3e18e811f91ac0b621ab424f5164f0a19e02b68ab63e0aae14d4a887b1a8d1f9&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: iStock-147989111-840x475.png (470.32 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

Stallions were typically the ones making judgment calls, as they were the ones entrusted with protecting everyone else. Their current circumstances just... made all those habitual behaviors feel a little off at the moment, though.

Neither of <em>them</em>, specifically, were accustomed to making decisions. Stallion or not.

She paused her eating at his glance, before looking back towards the illusory images, contemplating them more dedicatedly for a moment. 

&quot;... You said... there were other centaurs in town...?&quot; She ventured after a moment&#39;s thought.

Amunet offered her a small smile. &quot;I cannot guarantee that. But I have seen centaurs living in that town before, yes. Mind you... I have been alive many centuries. Memories I have of that nature are usually many decades in the past. But I have been few other places with such a wide array of races living together; even tieflings, whom many societies can be rather prickly about, have no issue living in Fielbarry as freely and comfortably as anyone else. So it would be no surprise to me at all if there were centaurs amongst the current residents.&quot;

&quot;... Do you know of any herds in these... the southern hills?&quot; 

&quot;There may be,&quot; Amunet offered, &quot;But none I have personally encountered. However, the work that has me traveling so much as an emissary typically brings me to various civilizations across the land, so I have a bit of a harder time saying what does or does not exist in untamed wilderness. Given that there are virtually no geographical boundaries that would prevent a herd from Helasia to migrate north into those hills, it&#39;s certainly plausible. But I cannot say for certain.&quot;

Jazirah chewed on that a moment, her ears delicately angled back as she thought, a slight furrow to her brow. Finally, she looked back to Rahul, and very quietly (as if Amunet could not overhear her without issue simply due to proximity) murmured, &quot;... Wherever we go first is not where we are obligated to stay.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Kemet makes for a very handsome steed. I will simply adjust our pace to be comfortable to yours. And I will be able to open the doorway to this sanctum every night, so you will have a comfortable place to rest and refresh yourself instead of having to camp in the wilderness. Though, of course, you are never obligated to spend the night in here if you would prefer to sleep outside.&quot;

She settled her slender fingers around the tea, lifting it to enjoy its aroma. &quot;I&#39;ve arranged for one of the front rooms on the first floor to be made comfortable for your rest, where you can have continuous line of sight of the exit, if that is something you would appreciate. Normally I would show you to a room meant to more conventionally host guests overnight, but I have the feeling you would prefer one foot out the door, so to speak, more than you would enjoy the luxuries of a dedicated bedroom.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He could feel the exhaustion weighing on him, especially now that all their needs had been taken care of save sleep, but he&#39;d have to remain awake and on guard for a while yet, so Jazirah could get some rest.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

For whatever it is worth, I give you my word you will not be disturbed at any point throughout the night. My own quarters are on a higher floor, and Amara will be keeping out of the first floor entirely. And, as always, if you ever have any requests, be it the fetching of items such as blankets, or additional food or drink, or even for the ambient temperature to be adjusted, simply request it of the sanctum and it will be seen to.&quot; She delicately wiped off her lips with one of the provided napkins, and gracefully rose to her feet, taking her tea with her. 

&quot;If you head out the way we came in, the room that will be on your right, closest to the exit, will be prepared to accommodate you for the night. In the morning, you may sleep in as much as you would like to; I am not traveling with a time constraint, so please, take all the time you need to rest.&quot; Her smile widened slightly, and she continued, &quot;But I will silence my prattling now and leave you to it. Have a good night, both of you. It has been a pleasure to make your acquaintance.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
