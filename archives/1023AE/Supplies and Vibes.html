A certain excitement and energy thrummed through her; there was something so sweet about the anticipation and build up before a mission. Cain bounced on the balls of her feet, almost giddy at the chance to get out of town and fuck shit up at the Longwatch Estate. Knowing that Lord Skhalhammer had a rather eclectic collection of goods of <em>course</em> had no bearing on Cain&#39;s excitement, although she had plans to check the location out with rather sticky fingers.

In Fielbarry, though, Cain controlled herself, and acquired most supplies through more traditional means. She and Niamh had planned an Entirely Legitimate And Above Board Shopping Trip before parting ways at the last jam session, with an open invitation to any of their friends to join. As Cain exited her own quarters, she gave a brisk knock on Niamh&#39;s door, calling out that she was heading over to the designated meeting spot at the Creeping Root Inn.</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=healthpotion><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=healthpotion src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/969062069515202591.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>5</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

The door to Niamh&#39;s room hung slightly ajar as the sounds of faint shuffling resonated within, and a pair of large owlish eyes quickly poked through the cracked door as Lil Man wrapped himself around from the door handle. His ears rotated forwards as the soft clap of a leather fixture snapped into place, and the little body snapped back around the door as it was pulled fully open and he was unceremoniously scooped up, only to be plopped down on Cain&#39;s shoulder as Niamh greeted her with a grin.

As they moseyed out of the guild rooms, Cain furtively snuck Lil Man a ripe strawberry she&#39;d acquired from her rooms for this purpose.

The weather outside continued to trend towards autumn, although it was not so cool in temperature that either of the women needed an extra jacket. The clouds of the slightly overcast sky didn&#39;t seem to hold a threat of rain, although they nicely shielded the sun from Cain&#39;s eyes on the short 5 minute walk from their Guild Hall rooms to the Creeping Root Inn.

As they moved into slightly more public spaces, Cain modulated her bouncing, slipping into the more demure and controlled version of herself, but her eyes remained bright and warm as she spoke.

&quot;Pretty good crew heading out on this one. I swung by the message board, and we&#39;ve got Jaska and Yarrow along too. Think Jaska will sleep at all this time?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The weather seemed to have him in a good mood, enough so that he hummed a familiar tune as he strolled through town and to the shops he thought might have what he needed. The slight chill didn&#39;t seem to bother him much, and he wore his usual loose-fitting clothing and cloth wrappings. Though he had no cloak or coat, he did have a leather satchel to carry what he needed, as well as a dagger tucked away Just In Case™.

The day was young enough that the usual crowds of town had not gotten terribly dense yet - which made catching a glimpse of familiar fluttering attire that much easier.

Though his eyes (and whatever wild story he was telling) were focused on Kel, it didn&#39;t take him too long to spot the pair of ladies across the street. The wild waving turned to a more controlled wave sent their way, coupled with a delighted smirk as he dragged Kel along with him towards the pair.

It&#39;s bold, will keep us on our toes. There&#39;s no worth in getting rusty.&quot; Still, anyone who glanced at her list would see that Cain had also wisely written healing potions down at Niamh&#39;s suggestion.

Cain sent a bemused glance at Yarrow, taking in the arm slung around Kelnari with a chuckle. &quot;Why am I completely unsurprised that you&#39;ve already found this cute little thing,&quot; she deadpanned, although her expression was kind as she smiled at the other pair. &quot;It&#39;s good to see you both, though.

It was a good day so far, and he was determined to keep it that way (for himself).

&quot;What&#39;s all this, then?&quot; he asked, meeting the growing group with his usual lazy smile. &quot;Whatever&#39;s got the town&#39;s misfits and hooligans congregatin&#39; like this, hmm?&quot; At least he recognised most of the faces - only Yarrow&#39;s new friend was unfamiliar, though he met the individual with a friendly nod before turning to Niamh and Cain again.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She admittedly looked a little pitiful. She knew her father was leaving. Did not know for how long—she never did—and no matter how many times he went out on missions, it never seemed to get easier on her. Every symptom of her neurological oddities crescendoed to the same peak of misery and panic each time. But at least, for the sake of public decency, she was currently in the throes of clingy despair—which was far more muted than some of the other phases these circumstances had her cycling through. She walked close at Jaska’s heel, bundled in exceptionally soft looking clothes that offered warmer layers without looking like they wrapped too tightly on her body. Her feet remained bare, though; they didn’t really make shoes for rat peets.

As Jaska slowed to a halt, she did too. She didn’t look up—or at least, didn’t seem like she was going to look up. But something caused a subtle sort of double-take, and she <em>did</em> pause a moment to stare at Kelnari. 

But her face was an empty, abject, emotionless thing that did very little to indicate what had caught her momentary attention. Whatever it was, it didn’t last terribly long, before she was back to staring off at nothing, shuffling a little closer to Jaska’s leg.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He looked back over as Niamh continued, some of the playfulness replacing with an understanding nod. Just a little though, as he flashed Cain a grin in reply to hers and to Ezekiel&#39;s ominous promise.

Ah, speaking of Meos... He gave him a friendly little wave and a snort. &quot;You didn&#39;t see the mission board this time? Now who&#39;s gonna give us magic buttpats?&quot;

And then there was Jaska too, and his delightful bundle of hell looking absolutely miserable.
