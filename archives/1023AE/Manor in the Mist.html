It&#39;s gorgeous and clearly very finely crafted. You can easily see that the tapestry tells a story, starting towards the side nearest the front door, and progressing as it reaches down the hall, so that the narrative seems to follow you as you walk through the parlor.

That narrative looks to be the story of the Skhalhammer family in tableaux, beginning with their origins as traitors to their kingdom, continuing through their work as mercenaries and cutthroats followed by their time as privateers for the crown and culminating with Jhaal assuming power and leveraging his family&#39;s wealth to create one of the most powerful corporations in the world. It&#39;s all presented very regally, with the Skhalhammers depicted dressed in royal blues and gold, and even the illustrations of their traitorous origins laid out in a way that seems to paint them in a very noble light.

<em><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">Continued...</code></em></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1162656848743243816 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1162656848743243816><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, October 14, 2023 12:43 AM">12:43 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">When you look at the tapestry&#39;s reflection in the mirror, however, none of these illustrations are present. But it tells a story nonetheless, in the same tableaux style. As your eyes follow the slightly gloomier-looking weavings, its depicted narrative opens with woven illustrations of beautiful lands and buildings, like nothing any of you have seen before. Though the medium of a tapestry has limitations, you can tell that the images it means to convey are of something truly breathtaking. The land looks somewhat tropical, dense with flora and fauna of the most colorful variety--and the buildings depicted do not interrupt that color. Instead, they only amplify it, with much of the surfaces decorated in brilliant colors woven into the architecture. You realize the tapestry is depicting a stunning, vibrant excess of stained glass making up gorgeous accents across these structures. 

And there are people depicted in these scenes, too. People dressed in styles also not recognized by you, but equally vibrant and exotic and colorful as their surroundings. 

But the scenes evolve as your eyes travel along the timeline the tapestry has laid out. A figure stands, starkly out of place in the beautiful setting, seemingly exploring it and its people. The colorful people seem to show no aggression, but there are illustrations showing them holding their hands up to the stranger, barring him entry from certain places. One even gestures for the stranger to return to a ship seen off the coast.

The stranger is shown retreating, obligingly withdrawing from the colorful civilization. But not to the ship; only to the beach where he is alone. 

An arcane circle on the ground heralds the arrival of more strangers. These men are in uniform, dressed in blues and golds. These men carry weapons. 

The illustration rapidly devolves into the armed men storming the beautiful structures. They brute-force their way past the people&#39;s gentle boundaries. Where the weave of the tapestry illustrates the colorful people who have been cut down in the foreigner&#39;s wake, there is no red thread; the fabric of the tapestry itself is sliced over the images of their bodies, and a slow trickle of crimson stains the fabric down to the floor, where it pools on the hardwood.

The strangers enter the place the colorful people wanted to keep them out of. There is illustrated a small but beautiful box, like a cube of radiant stained glasswork. 

The backdrop of the beautiful, vibrant land and buildings is no longer present as the illustrations continue. The box is still colorful and beautiful, but its surroundings are dull in comparison, where it sits on a gilded pedestal. Hovering over it is a dwarven man, dressed immaculately in golds and blues. The glow of the box reflects in his eyes, hands reaching for it, coveting it despite already possessing it.

There is a great splintering of color next. The fabric of the tapestry bears another slice marring through it, though this one does not bleed. Instead, like a tear through reality, a horrid monster bursts into the weaving. 

The last illustration the reflected tapestry depicts is that of the Skhalhammer Manor. Encircling the building like a great serpent constricting its prey is an entity that horrifies you to look upon--yet no matter how you squint at it, the details slip away from your mind. Only the emotion remains: a feeling of dread in your core.</div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1162657115928809512 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1162657115928809512><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, October 14, 2023 12:44 AM">12:44 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><h2>Ozymanthios</h2><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content"><em>I have given you the fury of nature.

The mass crumbles into itself, shrinking, soon no longer even resembling a boar at all--until finally, the shifting brambles still. 

There, at the center, what had been the very core of Ozymanthios--perhaps where a natural boar&#39;s heart would have been--a strange bloom has taken root, splitting up from the salt-soaked planks. It&#39;s no flower, but... it has a strange, alien beauty to it all the same. Even as it is covered in nasty thorns, some even protruding like large, thick fangs from its tangled stems. Something about the little knot of vines not only strikes you as beautiful, but as sacred. The vibrant green is accented by shocks of vermillion, speckles on the jagged leaves resembling splatterings of viscera. There is a sense of thrumming vitality from it, the tips of its leaves and vines stirring gently, like idle, curious tentacles.

The vines are drawn to your arm. With them comes not the bite of countless thorns--but a strange surge of strength. Of warmth. You watch as your own flesh seems to move in reply, the faint shapes of vines that press together to make up your body shifting, adjusting. <em>Making room</em>.

The newer vines crawl through your skin. It&#39;s not comfortable, but it feels <em>right</em> in a way you never would have expected. It surges vitality through you, even as it visibly seems to split your flesh and burrow living brambles into your body.

But the agony that would bring anyone else does not come to you. You feel battered, bruised, chewed up and spit out in just about every possible way. 

But as you stand over what was once a boar from your nightmares, and is now merely a mound of thorny vines, it is impossible to deny the way the conquest rings through you. You are Fucked Up... but you did something here. It&#39;s not the end of your troubles.

But maybe... it&#39;s a start.

As you revel in that alien sensation, the brambles that entangled your allies loosen, then begin to wither and fall away. The rest of you undoubtedly earned several superficial cuts and pricks throughout the experience you were forced to bear witness to--but are otherwise unharmed, and no longer restrained.</div></div></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Nor the deck of a ship.

Instead, what you step up into is a huge, beautiful room lined with books on all sides, lovely plush carpet, gorgeous wooden bookshelves and warm candlelight. A library, presumably. 

Large, two-story windows on the far wall would presumably look out over the forest--or maybe a garden--under normal circumstances, but now, there is nothing to see through them but fog. They do, however, have a strange spattering of stained glass within them; most of the pane seems traditionally clear, but shards of colored glass trickle up from the sill in some places, as if bleeding through. You have no idea if this was part of the non-corrupted design. It&#39;s pretty, though.

At the opposite end of the room is a sizeable hearth, with the embers of a mostly dead fire still smoldering away within it. Plush armchairs are seated around it where occupants could indulge in the fire&#39;s warmth, but they are empty now. A decorative, floor-length mirror, however, shows the reflection of a woman sitting in one.

It&#39;s a stout, dwarven woman dressed in noble finery, but she is slightly curled up onto the seat in a way that feels like a deviation from noble properness--and she&#39;s quietly sobbing to herself.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1162658200332554261 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1162658200332554261><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, October 14, 2023 12:48 AM">12:48 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">Feel free to post in!

Her breathing was more and more regulated with each passing moment, but tenseness still permeated her being. She held her free hand (her other was gripping Yarrow&#39;s, just as much for her benefit as his) up in front of her, pleased that her shaking had been reduced to a barely perceptible tremor. Nodding to herself, she let her eyes drift over the books and fireplace. It was hard to trust anything in this place, especially somewhere restful. 

On the best of days, Cain locked her own skeletons and past misdeeds deep into the recesses of her memory. She tucked bones into dusty corners and shoved sins into chests, locked them away and promptly lost the key. Cain… wasn&#39;t big on reflection. Yet she found herself shaken to her core at how deeply <em>personal</em> Niamh&#39;s and Yarrow&#39;s experiences had been. The mental bones rattling in drawers in her mind were always there, a distant and dull racket easily ignored. Maybe it was the mist, or seeing her friends confront their deep fears, but today Cain was finding it difficult to ignore the cacophony. Abruptly, she thought of how it felt to try to tether Niamh and Yarrow to reality in the face of their illusions. Cain shuddered, knowing they would do the same for her, but hoping to show even half the strength that Yarrow and Niamh had in facing their nightmares.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1162792861494947860 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1162792861494947860><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, October 14, 2023 9:43 AM">9:43 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>As the group stood, taking in the room, Cain gave Yarrow&#39;s hand a tight, lingering squeeze before she detached herself from his side. She&#39;d probably been a little clingy to Yarrow and Niamh, but it was difficult to summon self-consciousness in light of what the group faced together. She was certain they would not have survived the horrors thus far had they not been working as a team. 

Faced with a new place to explore, though, Cain finally wielded her ability to compartmentalize, slipping into a clinical, efficient assessing mode. The mirror containing the sobbing dwarven woman was noted to return to momentarily, but Cain first wanted to scan the room. Her eyes especially looked for anything artifact-y in nature, potentially in a display case as Vanderson had described.

She&#39;d probably been a little clingy to Yarrow and Niamh, but it was difficult to summon self-consciousness in light of what the group faced together. She was certain they would not have survived the horrors thus far had they not been working as a team. 

Faced with a new place to explore, though, Cain finally wielded her ability to compartmentalize, slipping into a clinical, efficient assessing mode. The mirror containing the sobbing dwarven woman was noted to return to momentarily, but Cain first wanted to scan the room. Her eyes especially looked for anything artifact-y in nature, potentially in a display case as Vanderson had described. Being careful where she stepped, on the lookout in case one of the real rogues pointed out a trap, Cain made a slow investigative circuit of the room.

The tiefling kept his distance from the three, letting them comfort each other with the air of one avoiding a trio of plague victims coughing up phlegm without covering their mouths.

He wasn&#39;t foolish enough to believe his turn wouldn&#39;t be coming. And that honestly made it all the worse, because it had his mind circling endlessly, wondering which of his scars would be cut open to bleed for the perverse viewing of these three people he hardly knew and certainly didn&#39;t trust. He wanted to think he&#39;d be able to remain stoic and unmoving in the face of them, now that he knew to prepare for them, but the reality was he had no idea.

At least Meos hadn&#39;t signed up for this. If he had, and was exposed to Jaska&#39;s trauma, Jaska would have had to make sure Meos didn&#39;t return from this particular venture.

Odd that the idea of Yarrow knowing didn&#39;t incite the same feeling. Then again, Yarrow was insufferable, but he wasn&#39;t a racist prick and didn&#39;t go out of his way to needle and insult him. He was just a sex-crazed alcoholic. And thought him pretty for some reason. Blame the alcohol for that. Maybe he didn&#39;t care as much because he&#39;d already seen Yarrow&#39;s own trauma broadcasted loud and clear. At least Cain and Niamh were inoffensive and perfectly capable people, unlikely to use any of this information against him.

Heaving a deep sigh, he clenched his jaw and took a circle around the room, completely ignoring the crying visage of the dwarven roman to examine the room for anything of interest. Anything to distract from what was to come.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

More than any other sights so far--save, perhaps, for the parlor--this room felt like the most likely to be depicting the manor as it would have been under normal circumstances. The mentions made by those the party had spoken to, likening the manor more to some sort of museum that also just happened to serve as a living space, were apparent in the current surroundings.

It was cozy, and certainly suggested the utility of a library, but impossible to miss were the stuffed heads of various beasts decorating the walls, each more exotic and rare than the last. There were no bears or bison--<em>certainly</em> no stags--but instead, the head of a white rhinoceros. The head of an elephant. The head of an enormous crocodile, whose hide gleamed like an oil slick. The head of what some among the party may have been able to identify as an <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/thumbnails/30761/865/1000/1000/638061096692582271.png">ankheg</a>, massive mandibles reaching out grandly. What might have been mistaken, at a glance, for a more traditional mounted deer was instead the wicked visage of a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/thumbnails/30834/676/1000/1000/638063894764197990.png">peryton</a>.

Similarly adorning the walls and perimeter of the room were displays beyond taxidermy. Various weapons, even a shield or two, hung upon the walls, all looking regal and important. Each bore a little bronze plaque beneath it, only a couple inches wide; subtle inclusions, but proudly boasting the importance of each item. While none claimed any enchantments or unique power to them, it seemed all had been noteworthy in some way or another, wielded by someone of legend, used to slay a beast of unfathomable ferocity. It seemed the only one the Skhalhammers were missing was Excalibur itself.

There were also ornate, glass display cases holding other various treasures. Some looked to be on permanent display, while for others, their enclosure almost made it seem like they were routinely picked up.

In an exquisite frame hanging at eye-level, what looked to be a curious card--the size of a tarot card--was meticulously centered and preserved behind a layer of glass. It had a gilded golden frame to it that caught the light with an almost mirror-like reflectivity, and the illustration depicted inside that border looked to be of some sort of... horrible, vaguely bird-like monster. A scroll-like banner was illustrated over the bottom of the creature&#39;s image, bearing what looked like about three words in Abyssal script. 

Jaska would also have no trouble honing in on an almost whimsically charming sight, where a little statue in the shape of an owl, all made in gold, was centered under a glass dome that appeared to not be held in place by any securing means. The <a href="https://gyazo.com/1b427b8139e5fe5ec25c332b1849dff6">owl figurine</a> looked specifically designed to be a resting place for a pair of spectacles, which sat neatly on the owl&#39;s face, the golden beak settled where a wearer&#39;s nose would rest between the lenses.

Similarly, another little framed display nearby the spectacles was made differently than the display showcasing the strange card; this one instead had a glass front to it with a small, delicate little brass knob at its bottom edge, appearing as though it could be lifted up on its hinged upper edge to grant access to the prize inside. Which was a simple-looking thing; a little badge of sorts, maybe an inch and a half in width, made of silver, with an edge of gold lining the outside of the shape. That shape was of a maple leaf, and in its center, the image of a mug or stein was embossed.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1162894071388442707 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1162894071388442707><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, October 14, 2023 4:25 PM">4:25 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Jaska&#39;s eye would naturally be drawn to a display that very much did <em>not</em> look meant to have its contents easily accessible; a glass case where a long, elegant knife with pretty filigree subtly accenting it was being reverently held upon a stand--a stark contrast from the apparently storied weapons and shield decorating the walls, and one which Jaska could not miss. It, too, had a little brass plaque at the front of the case.

While Jaska was assessing all these things so plainly on display, Cain--still a little shaken from the experiences she had been trying to support her friends through--fully intended to help. Instead, her attention landed on a book, sitting on an end table beside one of the plush chairs. After a moment, she was struck with the realization that... it was the <em>only</em> book not neatly tucked onto a shelf.

The universe, perhaps throwing her a proverbial bone.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She just felt like she wasn&#39;t contributing anything to the search task while her mind was so consumed with what would potentially be in store for her.

Feeling like a very lukewarm investigator to the search, Cain&#39;s desperate eyes cast around the room, looking for anything to catch her eye. There. On the end table, the only book pulled out in the entire room. She walked over, already reaching to touch it before stopping, hovering her hand in mid-air. Dimly, she remembered that it would probably be wise to get a sense of where magical items might lay in this room. She closed her eyes, steeled her senses, then began reaching out with her power.

He briefly considered the crying dwarven woman in the mirror, considering finding a tapestry to cover it... Perhaps it would muffle her obnoxious sobbing. But more importantly, it would blind her to what he planned on taking. But he decided eventually that he just didn&#39;t care if she saw or not. They were here to end this curse or whatever it was. She should be grateful they were here at all. And a measley thousand gold a person - provided they were even going to see that money given the snooty elf&#39;s likely demise - considering the trauma they were going to be going through, was not enough.

So, theft.

And also a note to disclose this information to Arsast. The satyr would love to have this junk in his shop. Probably hang undergarments on the antlers of the peryton before putting it up for sale.

He noted Cain&#39;s attendance to his snooping and did nothing to discourage her, even giving her an approving nod at her own find. As it so happened, the items they were collecting were pinging her magical senses and confirming that what he was gathering was indeed of use, and now sat arranged on the table for a closer look.

The knife, of course, had his primary attention, those being his weapon of choice, and he held it in his hands and studied it thoughtfully. &quot;Any of you lot able to identify the properties of items?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not because Jaska was doing anything wrong; Cain respected his controlled, measured demeanor in this moment. She just felt like she wasn&#39;t contributing anything to the search task while her mind was so consumed with what would potentially be in store for her.

Feeling like a very lukewarm investigator to the search, Cain&#39;s desperate eyes cast around the room, looking for anything to catch her eye. There. On the end table, the only book pulled out in the entire room. She walked over, already reaching to touch it before stopping, hovering her hand in mid-air. Dimly, she remembered that it would probably be wise to get a sense of where magical items might lay in this room. She closed her eyes, steeled her senses, then began reaching out with her power.

Cain&#39;s voice was pitched low and quiet as she answered Jaska, not really because they were in a library, but more because she wasn&#39;t sure what was lurking around the corners. She stared at the book in front of her, wondering if it was worth the risk of picking it up. Remembering that the Duke had had grandchildren running around, she hoped that whatever enchantments might be on the book were not harmful. Exhaling a flat breath of air out her nose, she reached down and picked it up, looking over the front cover and first few pages.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was an elegant book, though the front cover bore no title. It was instead decorated in a pretty, albeit rather abstract design of forest green linen and gold-foil accents meticulously crafted over a sturdy hardcover body. The spine of the book, though, offered a very good indication as to what Cain had found, giving the book it&#39;s introduction with the text of a title: <em>Dominic&#39;s Field Guide to Language</em>.

What did someone say in a situation like this? &#39;What&#39;s wrong?&#39; <em>Oh buddy.</em> What <em>wasn&#39;t</em> wrong? He&#39;d have laughed if someone asked him that, but he wasn&#39;t exactly the best litmus test of what was a normal reaction to that sort of thing.

Assuming Jaska didn&#39;t express opposition to this plan, Cain quietly made her way back across the library to Yarrow and Niamh, slipping her free hand back into Yarrow&#39;s, and feeling immediately better. 

Cain likewise was ill-equipped to comfort a stranger showing quite so many emotions. Only her training kept her preternaturally still and contained, as she felt awkward enough to shuffle on her feet where she stood. After a few seconds of this, Cain showed Yarrow the card, asking with a quiet murmur for the word to be translated.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She clocked the looks on Jaska and Cain&#39;s faces as they took to giving the room a once-over, her heart heavy for them as she too started to wonder what traumas from their lives she and Yarrow would be privy to. There had already been so much revealed about the man at her side - her grip on his hand tightened into another I&#39;m-here-I&#39;m-with-you squeeze as the flashes of his wife&#39;s mutilated face swarmed her memory again. Better, she realized grimly, than watching her mother&#39;s death replay again and again, if only because it wasn&#39;t her direct pain. Better the feel of Yarrow&#39;s hand on hers than remembering the silken feel of Cha Cha&#39;s hair, covered in viscera. Catching Yarrow&#39;s gaze following them, the somber expression shared, she bumped her shoulder into his gingerly and spoke with a resigned tone. &quot;Dont know if it counts as a silver lining to be selfish, but hey - at least the house is probably done tormenting <em>us</em>. Maybe we&#39;ll figure out some sage advice to give by the time it comes for them.&quot;
She followed him quietly as they approached the chair, facing the mourning woman appearing in the mirror.  The reaction Yarrow got was... Unsurprising. Given the woman&#39;s circumstances, Niamh hardly thought the misery was unwarranted. She met Yarrow&#39;s pleading look with a soft smile, squeezing his hand for maybe the hundredth time in acknowledgment. Resting the other on the back of the chair, she summoned up a gentle tone and addressed the poor woman.
&quot;Given the current circumstances its been unusual for us to find someone dressed so elegantly - you must be the lady of the house. My name is Niamh, we&#39;re here to help.&quot; The smile, she found, came a little easier as Cain circled back to re-join their daisy chain, and she gave the woman a nod on her return.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He returned the shoulder bump gratefully, giving her his best attempt of a smile. Not a bad one, considering he was used to faking it til he made it. &quot;Here&#39;s hoping our tongues serve us just as well here, eh?&quot; he whispered back.

Cain&#39;s return was welcome, fingers immediately re-lacing around hers. Content to let Niamh&#39;s good heart do the heavy lifting, he looked towards Cain at the murmured request before squinting at the card. He mouthed the words without immediate recognition before murmuring the translation, trying to think if he recognized what it meant. &quot;The Vrock Milzru..?&quot;

A bit of looking around left her with an easy-to-reach deduction that it was a dictionary of sorts, translating words--even some phrases--from common into another language.

&quot;... I married him because I loved him. Because he loved me. He&#39;s... always been passionate about his business, but... over the years... I watched him... make choices. Little things at first. Things easily justified. One day I woke up and realized... I don&#39;t know the man lying next to me anymore. I... I can&#39;t tell you how long its been since I&#39;ve felt loved by him, either. But I see the way he treats his business. Our finances. He&#39;s still in love. But it&#39;s with coin. Doesn&#39;t even... spend time with our children anymore. Just gives them... extravagant presents. That&#39;s all anything means to him anymore... And at the expense of... <em>any</em> notion of morality, sometimes. It&#39;s... like he&#39;s under a charm, the way he just... can&#39;t even begin to see the horrors under his hands... But there&#39;s... there&#39;s no charm. Just... gold in his eyes...&quot;

She shook her head a little. &quot;... Whatever you&#39;ve... apparently heard of... I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just more of the same. I don&#39;t care. I don&#39;t care whatever it was, or what <em>curse</em> he&#39;s unleashed. I... I have to take care of myself, and my babies.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Kinda. He squinted, letting out a soft hum.

&quot;I can tell you what it&#39;s <em>not,&quot;</em> He mused. &quot;It&#39;s not abyssal, celestial, elvish, or sylvan.&quot;

And yet there was still a pause in his expression as the rusty cogs in his head churned, head tilting slightly.

&quot;Oh! I see it. He moved it to the shelf with the rest of his more prized tomes. Over there, on the left--under the peryton. There&#39;s a book bound in white rhino leather--it should be titled <em>Dreams Made Flesh</em>. By... a Dr. H-something-or-other, if I&#39;m not mistaken? My job here was to help maintain the library specifically, and the Lord always seemed to have his nose in that one in the time since I was hired--which was only about a week before all this mess happened. I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s <em>always</em> had such a fixation on the book, but... unless you can find his study, I think that&#39;s the only thing that might have a hope at being relevant. But I&#39;ve not read it myself, so... it might be a dead end.&quot;

A beat, before she did a little double-take at the book Cain and Yarrow were looking through. &quot;Oh! And you found that one as well. Quite a handy tool. I admit, there were times I played with it myself when it didn&#39;t seem in use.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>My dear readers, allow me to transport you to a time and place where the thrill of discovery was my constant companion. It was on a fine, crisp morning when my intrepid journey led me to the shores of an island shrouded in mystery—the land I now humbly name &quot;The Scattered Isles.&quot; The culmination of an adventure driven by a relentless pursuit of the unknown, the story of my arrival is a testament to the audacity and resilience of the human spirit.

The origins of this fabled land remained shrouded in obscurity until I embarked on my quest, spurred by whispers of Captain Elwyn&#39;s enigmatic tales. Ah, Captain Elwyn, a fellow soul with aspirations to seize the enigma of these scattered isles, but fate seemed to favor my bold enterprise. Backed by the unwavering faith of esteemed financial supporters, I led my valiant crew across uncharted seas, driven by the audacious belief that the truth of the isles rested within my grasp.

Emerging from a veil of uncertainty, I encountered the intoxicating aroma of lush, semi-tropical foliage, some of it familiar, while other flora defied my knowledge of botanical taxonomy. An exotic kaleidoscope of life embraced us, and the island&#39;s very essence was a harmonious dance between the known and the utterly alien.

But the heart of this adventure lay in my encounter with the enigmatic natives, whom I would later name the Dreamkin. These gentle souls, dressed in the vibrant hues of a painter&#39;s palette, welcomed us with a grace that belied their primitive existence. My limited knowledge of their language did little to quench my insatiable curiosity, as I delved into their culture with the zeal of a scholar seeking to unmask nature&#39;s secrets.

The Dreamkin, though initially wary of my presence, revealed a society I could scarcely comprehend.

Though my attempts at direct conversation with the natives bore little fruit, my incessant observations and relentless inquiries have led me to formulate a theory, a theory that will leave the world agog and academics astir with awe and trepidation.

Intricately detailed and arranged, the stained glass murals and glass tile mosaics told a story that transcended the bounds of their enigmatic language, unfolding before me like a silent epic. They seemed to narrate a tale of ethereal beings, perhaps the Dreamkin themselves in their original forms, traversing the ethereal realm and descending upon our material plane. Despite my limited understanding of their pictorial language, the visual narrative paints a picture of a migration, a journey embarked upon by these spectral entities from the plane of dreams--one that would be breathtaking in its beauty, if not for an insidious implication.

My esteemed readers, I postulate that the Dreamkin, ethereal beings of unparalleled enigma, hail from the plane of dreams itself, descending upon the material realm and its mortal folk like specters from an unfathomable reverie. Alas, my observations suggest that the noble souls of these unsuspecting humans are replaced by these dream entities, or &quot;dream spawn&quot; as I have come to call them. Though I remain uncertain of the fate that befalls the displaced human spirits, my keen intellect leads me to contemplate the darkest of possibilities. Could the dream spawn consume the original souls, devouring them in a ravenous bid for dominance, extinguishing the essence of their hosts? Or do they perform a cruel transmigration, casting the spirits adrift in the vast void, forever bereft of purpose and wandering eternally? The truth eludes me, my dear readers, but I cannot deny the sense of foreboding that shrouds this undiscovered facet of Dreamkin culture.

It is with a heavy heart that I ponder these unsettling notions. Their hesitance, nay, their deliberate refusal to share their lore, their very essence, is a disquieting specter that haunts my nights. Could it be that my benevolent hosts conceal some sinister agenda, the nature of which remains beyond the grasp of mortal comprehension? Such questions stir a tempest within my scientific soul, as my quest for knowledge dances along the precipice of perilous revelation.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1162982303446868029 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1162982303446868029><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, October 14, 2023 10:16 PM">10:16 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1162982306307379231 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1162982306307379231><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, October 14, 2023 10:16 PM">10:16 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>The Scattered Isles held secrets beyond my wildest imaginings, secrets veiled in color and obscured by artistic mastery. It was during my persistent investigations that I stumbled upon an artifact of unparalleled significance—a crystalline chest resplendent with a kaleidoscope of colors, which I came to believe the Dreamkin referred to as the &quot;Sina D&#233;cor.&quot; The intricacies of this peculiar title, I confess, remained beyond the grasp of my understanding, shrouded in an enigma that tugged at the very essence of my scientific curiosity.

This brilliant glass chest became the epicenter of an unraveling mystery. The stained glass murals surrounding its reverent placement featured a horrifying entity, a colossal, serpentine monstrosity whose name, I later learned, was Ephialtes. Ephialtes, a name whispered with reverence among the Dreamkin, appeared to be a nightmarish titan of vibrant colors. The mural&#39;s depiction suggested that this creature, Ephialtes, loomed protectively over the location of the Sina D&#233;cor, its visage both terrifying and entrancing, dominating the art with an aura of foreboding guardianship. Such peculiar devotion to this monstrous presence only deepened the suspicions that were to come, dear readers, regarding the true nature of the ostensibly gracious and beautiful Dreamkin.

As I ventured closer, the Dreamkin&#39;s genteel manner faltered, their initial hospitality dissolving into disquiet. With urgency in their eyes, they swiftly removed me from the vicinity of the Sina D&#233;cor, imploring me to return to my homeland. The disquieting nature of their reaction did not escape my discerning gaze, and I found myself grappling with theories that dared to drift into realms of the sinister.

Could it be that this Sina D&#233;cor contained a power that they held sacred, a power they wished to safeguard from the probing eyes of outsiders? Or, might it be that within the glass chest lay the essence of the displaced human souls, held captive by the Dreamkin to avert their destruction? My intellect probed these questions as I witnessed the rapid decline of the Dreamkin&#39;s amiability.

With each passing day, their demeanor grew tenser, the vibrancy of their artistry fading as though shrouded in the weight of an unknown sorrow. The once-welcoming Dreamkin now cast baleful glances in my direction, compelling me to consider the most unsettling of scenarios. The culmination of these disconcerting circumstances left me with no alternative but to make preparations for my return to the mainland.

It is with a heavy heart that I recount these harrowing events, dear readers. The Dreamkin, once the epitome of grace and hospitality, unleashed a nightmarish assault upon my crew and me on our final night on the island. Their actions, I must emphasize, left us with no choice but to defend ourselves against a people whose inner demons seemed to have risen to the surface.

I barely escaped with my life, and the artifacts I had secured were not pilfered, but rather retrieved in the face of an unrelenting onslaught. The Scattered Isles, once a realm of enchantment, were now tainted by the shadow of a mystery that, I fear, may forever elude the confines of our understanding.</em></span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=eye><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=👁️ src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/twitter/twemoji@latest/assets/svg/1f441.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>3</span></div></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1162982357314306079 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1162982357314306079><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, October 14, 2023 10:16 PM">10:16 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1162654925969428601/1162982357092024381/Divider.png?ex=65599a39&amp;is=65472539&amp;hm=a81aa8d937918f518dedfdae19539874b11751d1e7a8cc230af53671ca997354&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1162654925969428601/1162982357092024381/Divider.png?ex=65599a39&amp;is=65472539&amp;hm=a81aa8d937918f518dedfdae19539874b11751d1e7a8cc230af53671ca997354&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: Divider.png (4.13 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;How do you know they don&#39;t have souls?

Eyeing the rest of the seating in the room, he moseyed his way over to one of the couches to make himself comfortable, encouraging but not obliging either Niamh or Cain to follow him. Settling in a seat nearest to an arm of the couch, he set his book down to pull out instead a modestly sized box from his accoutrement. He gave it a look over, tilting the front up towards him before humming in approval. The right latch opened with a soft click, and he withdrew a trio of glasses and a flask. Briefly he pulled out a pipe, giving it a little admiring of its own before setting it back down inside the box. &quot;What&#39;re we feeling, beer, wine, or whiskey?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Intellectually, she knew these were her friends. Earlier, she had not hesitated before she&#39;d darted to their sides to lend strength. She&#39;d make the same choice again, without question, chipped tooth or not.

She&#39;d felt a near instant connection with Niamh, thinking back fondly to when she&#39;d crashed into both Cain&#39;s life and the disintegrating house on a fucking pegasus. Her warmth and wit had risen her high in Cain&#39;s esteem. Cain remembered the companionable drinks she&#39;d shared with Yarrow on their first mission, passing an evening together by the fire. She found it easy to be herself around him, and appreciated each new facet of his personality that she got to experience. Although she&#39;d lacked the lived example of it prior to meeting him, Cain knew what a good father Jaska was to Axa. Moreover, he was consistent and competent, two traits that Cain deeply admired. 

But she could not have predicted how much it bolstered her to have allies <em>truly</em> on her side. Cain had had teammates before, guildmates prior to joining the Valehunters... but to have true companions was quite novel. The comfort she took from her friend&#39;s statements was vast. 

Cain blinked; she&#39;d received her glass back on autopilot, and found that her arms were full of Niamh and Yarrow. She soaked in the feeling of their support, closing her eyes briefly as she breathed, trying to formulate words that would convey how much their unwavering loyalty meant.

&quot;Thank you.&quot; The words felt thin in the face of the friendship she basked in, but she tried all the same. &quot;Facing whatever it is, feels possible now.&quot; 

When she opened her eyes, her customary fire was back in them. She set her drink temporarily on a side table, and wrapped Niamh and Yarrow in a bone crushing hug of her own.  <em>Sorry, Jaska, for the PDA,</em> she mused with a hint of a smile.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

So she at least could be assured she had the support of his knives to stab her enemies.

Returning to the study of the knife in his hand, he made a twisting motion with it, and blinked as the glass in his other hand abruptly vanished. Jaska blinked, frozen for a moment, and then made the motion again... Nothing. Made the motion in reverse... And the glass appeared back in his hand. &quot;...Huh.

It might suck, but they&#39;d survive.

Settling back to relax, he reached over for his book, pausing to watch Jaska&#39;s fancy knife trick. His grin shot Jaska&#39;s way, and he raised his flask in a lazy sort of toast. &quot;Neat trick. That a new toy?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I&#39;m.. in one piece, which is more than I can say for some other figments of my nightmares,&quot; she muttered, shooting back the rest of the glass before passing it back to Yarrow.
&quot;I won&#39;t pretend that I dont have a complicated relationship with my mother, to put it <em>very</em> generously.&quot; The expression that settled into her face was mournful as she finally met Cain&#39;s gaze, looking for all the world as though she just wanted to curl up and sleep.

Despite the playful tease to his voice, he couldn&#39;t help but overhear the somber conversation beside him. Comforting someone wasn&#39;t his strong suit... But he could keep the booze flowing. He gently took Niamh&#39;s empty glass, sliding his flask into her hand instead to give her a nice supply of The Good Stuff. He wasn&#39;t sure if he should feel guilty or not for killing her mother, even if she was just a fucked up nightmare shade, and the uncertainty twisted in his gut. He&#39;d done it to protect them all.. it was better than the alternative of turning his blade on Niamh even when she had. Even if it meant the metaphorical blood was on his hands once again.

There would be time later to chastise the men for being allergic to emotions.
&quot;She never called me by my actual name even growing up. No one did. For a long time it was a familiarity thing, but as things got worse I think it morphed into paranoia. At the end I was barely ever Jasper either, after getting tangled in her messes.&quot; Her face twisted into a grimace at the memory, absentmindedly twisting the lid of the flask.
&quot;Something about protecting our true names, like we were devils that could be controlled by them.

Eyes narrowed, he reached over to point out a particular symbol. &quot;Didn&#39;t I see that before...? On your friend at the marketplace.&quot;

He flipped a page, a thumb underlining a stray word. “Dictionaries are boring and all, but seeing <em>what</em> words a language has can tell you a lot about who they are if you know what you’re looking for.” He paused, exhaling as his head fell back against the couch. “Either that, or it just tells you whatever the translator was looking for instead.

Her face took on a similar grim cast at Niamh&#39;s final analogy. Lifting her drink for a small clink against the flask, Cain met Niamh&#39;s gaze. &quot;I&#39;m glad you got away from her. Someone so concerned about exorcizing the cancer in her people should probably pay more attention to the parasite in their own brain.&quot; Cain rested her head on Niamh&#39;s shoulder as she spoke, reaching up to give a little kiss to her neck as if to say <em>I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here now</em>.

As the tone of the conversation from the other two changed from ribbing and standard insult trading to something a little more serious, Cain tuned half an ear back in. Every now and then, she snuck her free hand over to Yarrow, idly trailing a finger over the gentle thorns dotting his forearms, another tangible thanks that he was still here too.

Cain inhaled sharply as the conversation turned to Kelnari, lifting her head up to catch Niamh&#39;s eye with a poignant gaze. Once the boys pointed it out, she too remembered the strange mark on the newcomer&#39;s forehead. &quot;There&#39;s definitely more to him than it would initially appear.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Shuffling to better crane her neck over and see the passage they were reading, she met Cain&#39;s eye as her jaw set firmly and she slung an arm over Yarrow&#39;s shoulders for better snooping.
&quot;Nuala&#39;d called him a predator, when I checked in with her sniffing around him. Worse than our caliber,&quot; she added, gesturing vaguely between them. &quot;She only stuck around with him there because she feels safe around us.&quot; Her fingers drummed pm the back of the couch as she began carefully watching Yarrow in his perusal of the book.

If he was here for the box, why go to Fielbarry at all? If the island was to their west, why go around the mountains inland just to need to head back to the coast? There was always the chance he was incredibly lost, at least. Under Cain&#39;s touch, the thorns shifted in reaction to the stimulus. Gently, but in a way that was new compared to her familiarity to them. Almost a sense of life and awareness not previously present... though if he noticed, he said nothing for now.

Niamh&#39;s description of Kel via Nuala&#39;s observations earned a grin despite himself. He could practically feel the ghost of the gun pressed in the hollow of his chin again. &quot;Did she really?&quot; He murmured, sounding more pleased with the revelation than he should be. &quot;He&#39;s been so agreeable so far though.&quot;

His delight tampered off a little at the mention of the rune, and with a thumb to bookmark where he was he flipped back through what he&#39;d already glanced over so far. &quot;I&#39;ve been looking, but haven&#39;t found anything suggesting it&#39;s terribly special.

The second half of the pages, which had now caught the eye of both Yarrow and Jaska with the present intrigue, showed the foreign words in their own script. Narrowly included behind <em>that</em> section was a far less voluminous blip, only taking up a couple pages, that described the individual characters.

It only took a moment to locate the most familiar of the runes. According to this guide, the character was called <em>cajoh</em>. In a way almost reminiscent of the runes seen in Holbrekkan culture, these symbols both seemed to create an alphabet, but also have individual meaning as standalone symbols. That latter meaning was elaborated promptly after the rune was labeled with its name;

<em><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">Cajoh - A mark of control, willpower, and focus of emotion for a greater peace. Not to be confused with the suppressing of emotion, cajoh instead represents a stalwart guard and discipline of mind, mastery over chaos.

The wheels were turning inside Jaska&#39;s keen mind, as he reflected back on the story they were told and the puzzle pieces provided by the others in their interactions with Kelnari.

&quot;Nuala called him a predator, beyond what the rest of us were. Then there&#39;s the serpentine monstrosity devotedly guarding the location of the Sina D&#233;cor. If your pretty little friend is not connected to the serpent or the Sina D&#233;cor, I would be surprised.&quot;

He’d thought it cute, how reserved he came across despite his streak of debauchery. And yet he remembered how almost drained he’d sounded in the alleyway, talking to his ‘optimistic’ friend. “Mm. I almost wonder if it’s for the beast’s benefit, or his.” He mumbled.

At Jaska’s request for more, he snorted and splayed his hands in an empty gesture. The flask from the box was empty, and Niamh had his personal goodies. <em>What do you want me to do about it?</em> Despite the display, he nevertheless shifted to sneak a hand within the confines of his shirt and waist-wraps while trying not to disturb Niamh and Cain, pulling out… another flask. <em>Aha.</em> Opening it with his teeth, he obliged the tiefling his drink. Woe be it for him to deny someone his vice.

Cain followed Niamh&#39;s lead, crowding her head in to read the definition of the symbol on Kelnari&#39;s head. She couldn&#39;t help the involuntary shudder that ran through her reading the definition. She had spent much of her training seeking control over chaos and being punished when it was not achievable.

It also held a bit of ‘fake it til you make it,’ the stings of the previous rooms still weighing on the back of his mind where he desperately tried to keep them away.

Fingers brushed guiltily along little thorny pricks on their skin, some small measure of self-pity in his mind angry at the boar’s constant insistence. It was bad enough that he’d prodded Yarrow his whole life, but to mar them too? He blinked, glancing to the closed side of his fancy new toy on the table. There would be time to read later, for now, he dusted off the mental cobwebs in a different corner of his mind and set the book aside. “If we’re going to sit here for a while, let me at least take a look at you. I won’t have you keeling over from sepsis before we get out of here.”

The subtle click of the left side opened the box under his fingers, and he withdrew bandages, salves, and cleaning solutions for wounds. They felt almost foreign in his hand with their familiarity.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Catching Yarrow&#39;s guilty countenance, Cain caught his fingers, bringing them up to her mouth to return a gentle kiss. She didn&#39;t say anything, but the implication was that she&#39;d received these marks willingly, and would do so again without hesitation.

It furrowed back into place just as quickly as it registered what he intended to do, and her eyes fell on the raw residual pinkness and roughness of what once was the deep gash he&#39;d sustained by her hand, and myriad other wounds picked up from their jaunt through the wicked home.
Gingerly, she reached out to brush the loose hair away from his face, twisting one of the brambles behind his ear. &quot;Yarrow - please, the nicks on us are superficial at most.

He wanted to say &#39;don&#39;t worry about it&#39; but she already was. Wouldn&#39;t do much good to fight back there. Instead he cupped her hand to place another little kiss on it. &quot;I will, once I&#39;ve taken care of you. Besides, I like a little pain.&quot;

Giving her a tired grin he hoped was reassuring, he began his inspection in hopes that he could get ahead of any further protest on the matter. Cain&#39;s guess was right; it was a good distraction. The motions settled in clunkily almost at first. Though he was quite familiar with examining bodies in other contexts lately, dragging his mind back to a more clinical approach helped distance himself from his problems. It was hard to think about Penelope when he had people he could still help in front of him.

His fingers were light as they brushed away dried flecks of blood with bundles of gauze, quiet mutters in apologies at the stinging of cleaning solutions and salves.

She heaved a breath, trying to still the goosebumps rising all over her body. Cain was likewise too suspicious of an individual to believe in coincidence. She tried to keep her mind present, to enjoy the moments of quiet, but her mind moved relentlessly to consider whatever dark kismet led their party to this mission, to this library. 

Cain found comfort in Yarrow&#39;s jest about appreciating a little pain, his statement drawing an involuntary snort out of her. Her gaze was pure affection as her finger flicked a small rap at his shoulder, not enough to truly distract from his ministrations, but a tangible reminder that she was here and she cared for him. Whereas Niamh had seemed... at least willing to speak about her experience, Cain thought Yarrow markedly quiet after his trials. The demons he&#39;d fought that seemed to materialize out of the mist, as though some vengeful god were testing their group for unknown reasons... Cain was, if nothing else, extremely confident in many things. She found herself humbled by her inability to give verbal comfort to her friends in this moment. She didn&#39;t like to feel helpless, thrived on her usefulness, and hoped she was enough.

Once again, the slightly barbed nature of the conversation drew her back into the moment, a normalcy for which she was extremely grateful. She took another stabilizing breath in the lull of the conversation. 

&quot;None of you will die here.&quot; Cain&#39;s statement was not a reassurance, or her asking for this to be confirmed. She spoke like she was convinced it was absolute truth. In this, she was confident. They were a powerful group, and Cain was honored to defend them on the front lines. She didn&#39;t meet anyone&#39;s eyes, but if they looked at her, they would see a steely determination, a commitment to manifesting her words.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Once he set about busying himself with Jaska, Niamh curled up against Cain&#39;s side and brought her head to rest on her shoulder, gathering the nearest hand between both of hers. She nodded at Cain&#39;s stalwart confidence, managing a smile.
&quot;Aye. We&#39;ve learned a good amount already, and we can adjust our plan of attack to try and observe more about this thing&#39;s capabilities going forward.  We&#39;ve got you,&quot; she added, eyes flicking between Cain and Jaska. Lifting Cain&#39;s hand as if in demonstration, she laced their fingers together, and quickly squeezed it once.
&quot;I&#39;m here.&quot;
A second time, shortly after.
&quot;I&#39;m with you.&quot; 
Lowering their hands again, she sat a little straighter and left them with a hint of a smile.

Once he felt content with his fussing, He gave Niamh another quick peck on the cheek, accompanied by a murmured &quot;good girl&quot; before he moved to Jaska&#39;s side to examine his arm.

Though he opened his mouth with a ghost of a shit-eating expression out of habit, that oft ignored part of him with sensibilities had him close it with little more than a hum in favor of actually doing what he&#39;d said he&#39;d do. Perhaps it helped that Jaska&#39;s injury wasn&#39;t too severe, limiting the time the non-licensed doctor needed to clean and bandage it. &quot;Not bad... I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re stuck with us for a bit longer.&quot; He muttered with only half as much cheek as usual, giving Jaska a little nod before turning his attention onto Cain and her injuries now.

Bandages were a poor substitute for a proper cleric&#39;s healing touch, but he hoped it would be enough. It had to be.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Cain wouldn&#39;t say she was ready, exactly, because it was difficult to envision anyone truly being prepared to face The Horrors rattling around in their skulls... but as Niamh wove their fingers together, murmured words of solidarity and encouragement, Cain felt even more steel find its place in her spine. She soaked in this moment, memorizing the emotions Niamh&#39;s words awoke in her, internalizing the reminder. She&#39;d been a part of teams all her life, but those were professional relationships, competent but not fulfilling. Cain didn&#39;t have a baseline for what to expect from the team she was on now, where they genuinely cared for each other. She&#39;d been taught all her life to avoid this kind of emotion and connection, although Cain genuinely felt stronger for her friendships. 

&quot;I think I will need it,&quot; Cain spoke quietly, realistically, still dreading the trials to come, but bolstered by not having to encounter them alone. She tried to catch Jaska&#39;s eye, wondering his thoughts, wondering what the unknown held for them both.

Cain luxuriated in comfort Niamh provided, casting a watchful eye over the library occasionally as Yarrow made his rounds. She sat up straighter as it came to be her turn, unfurling her arm from around Niamh and throwing her free arm around Yarrow&#39;s shoulders as he settled in front of her. Cain drew him in, speaking quietly; the others could probably hear if they tried, but she was speaking to Yarrow directly. &quot;One day, I&#39;d love to hear about her.&quot; Cain squeezed him tight, also tightening her fingers where she still clung to Niamh with her other hand.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Of a strange tale of being formed in his brother&#39;s body, sharing it with him until he was given his own. It revealed his alien origins, of which he claimed no memory.

It took a second for his hands, shaking, to move again, to finish cleaning whatever prick of brambles he&#39;d been intent on.

She wanted the same for Yarrow too.

Her fingers never ceased moving, carding through his hair gently, affectionately, as she spoke in her quiet, low tone. &quot;Penelope means something to you, so she means something to me. It doesn&#39;t have to be now. But I would love for you to share her with me, if you&#39;re ever ready.&quot;

Gently, gingerly, she tucked a hand under his arm and guided him to sit with his back against Cain&#39;s knees instead, pulling the abandoned bandages into her lap and unfastening the buttons of his shirt that had been done up to better expose the residual injuries not healed magically.
&quot;I promised you a bottle of wine if ever you felt like talking about it - I stand by it too.

Vaguely noting Niamh&#39;s aims, he helped shift himself as she pleased until he leaned against Cain, head tilting back with a shuddered sigh. Despite feeling like he deserved none of it, he nevertheless, reached out a hand to each of them, gripping them with pitiful need. He closed his eyes a moment, exhaling a ghost of a laugh in disbelief. &quot;What did I ever do to deserve this?&quot; He murmured. Though the phrase was oft a familiar one on his mind, rarely did he ever find reason to say it with such adoration.

His fingers trailed along their cheeks ever so gently, head craning back to return a kiss to Cain first, then forward to Niamh as she started undoing his shirt. &quot;Thank you&quot; was almost a foreign phrase on his tongue, but he choked it out to them nevertheless. Though his cheeks were stained anew, a smile twitched his lips. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll do just fine.

Your payment was easily collected where the Traveler&#39;s Guild of Longwatch had been holding it; two-thousand gold each, in platinum coins. It <em>still</em> doesn&#39;t feel like nearly enough compensation... but at least your pockets are also heavy with spoils of pilfered items that, should they not prove worth keeping, can be exchanged back in town for more gold.

With a jolt and a rush, the teleportation circle flares around your weary group. And just like that, the ambient temperature around you is a little warmer, though still the slightly cooler atmosphere of autumn. The air has a different scent to it. You&#39;re home.

You leave Fielbarry&#39;s Traveler&#39;s Guild, and step out to the familiar roads. For the most part, these are surroundings that you have never feared horrors creeping out at you from. That&#39;s some comfort.

You left early in the morning on the day of your departure. As you arrive back in town, it is right at dusk, the sun almost completely gone beneath the horizon. You don&#39;t know if time moved strangely during whatever you experienced, but despite the business of your time in the manor and all the disorienting dissociative lurches that came with it, you at least <em>feel</em> as though you have been gone--and been awake--for a single, very taxing day.

As your party steps back into the comforts of home, you are free to seek out whatever evening&#39;s activities you desire, whether as a unified group, or splintered off on different paths.

Cain pulled a face as her thoughts turned toward Jhaal. She&#39;d been looking forward to giving him a piece of her mind, and Vanderson had been a poor substitute for her ire. Cain felt every trial deep within her bones, down to her soul. The platinum coins in her pack felt light by comparison.

Her mind seemed fractured, her normal ability to compartmentalize decimated after her encounter with Nyx. It had been many, many months since she&#39;d last see that face, and the experience had been exactly what she&#39;d hoped and feared.

She ran a hand down her face, uttering a quiet groan, trying to focus on the group around her. &quot;I&#39;m bloody exhausted.

She&#39;d be grateful he hadn&#39;t been gone more than the single day. Hopefully. A small part of him was braced for that empty, uncaring rejection, though he logically knew it had been an illusion and far from the truth of Axa&#39;s feelings for him.

It took him a moment to register Yarrow, but as he couldn&#39;t be fucked to let go of Axa for even an instant, his tail instead went to snatch up the necklace and rosary, one on each feathery tip. &quot;I&#39;ll get them to you later, then.

She lit one with practiced ease as she listened to their replies, grateful for the task to keep her hands busy.

At the offer of support in finishing her outstanding business with Nyx, Cain closed her eyes, briefly bowled over by the idea that a conclusion existed that didn&#39;t consist of running for the rest of her life. 

&quot;Do you know how the idea of doing something is so large, that it feels like even starting it is so impossible? I&#39;ve felt that about finishing things with her, with my old guild. I still have no fucking clue if any of that misty delusion was real. It was everything I&#39;ve dreamed of, and everything I&#39;d dreaded. I feel hollow now.&quot;

She paused, took another drag. She had a feeling she&#39;d associate this herbal smell with companionship going forward, a scent nostalgia with this particular conversation. She was struck with a profound sense of gratefulness.

&quot;You two seem to be holding up a little better, though.&quot; Cain gave a quiet self-conscious laugh.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He owed them honesty, at the very least.
