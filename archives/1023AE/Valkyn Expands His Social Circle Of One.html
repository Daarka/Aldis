Thankfully, Luka was on call with a sending stone he&#39;d acquired for Hiraeth for just such occasions, and it wasn&#39;t long before there was a knock at the door as Luka let himself in. &quot;The cavalry has arrived,&quot; he said softly, looking around for Valkyn to offer him a warm smile of greeting as well.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Tuesday, January 31, 2023 10:26 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He went to sit down on the edge of the bed, setting down his bag. &quot;I&#39;m going to push your shirt up to expose your back, okay?&quot; A muffled grunt of affirmation sounded from Hiraeth, and he went to push it up, helping thread his arms back out the baggy sleeves so he could expose his back up to his nape. &quot;There are some new studies that have come out from Xhorhas recently that I&#39;d like to try. It involves leads attached to an aether crystal that will generate pulses of a mild electrical current that is supposed to disrupt the pain signals your nerves are sending out from reaching your brain. I&#39;ve read the studies, and they&#39;ve helped greatly with patients with neuropathy that has been resistant to other methods.&quot;

Hiraeth had turned his head just slightly to listen, and gave a thumbs-up as his permission. Luka smiled and reached into his bag to take out what might look like an intimidating device - a crystal attached to a few long, thin, tentacle-like wires leading to thin needles, not unlike the ones he used in acupuncture. &quot;I&#39;m going to insert the needles in close to your spine. It&#39;s important you don&#39;t move, okay? They&#39;ll be placed here,&quot; he tapped at his spine, around his lower-mid back opposite the bottom of his sternum.

Another mumbled confirmation, and Luka delicately inserted the needles, setting the crystal upon his upper back. &quot;Okay, here we go. Let me know how you&#39;re feeling.&quot; He tapped the crystal, which started to glow softly yellow in flickering pulses. Hiraeth twitched at the tingling jolts, and after a few minutes, let out a soft groan.

&quot;It&#39;s receding a bit,&quot; he murmured. &quot;Tingles.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was a bit of an odd question for him to have.

Even to Hiraeth&#39;s untrained ear, he sounded remarkably eloquent in his native tongue, nothing like the halting and often incorrect way he used common.

Something almost antique to his dialect. After all... language evolves, and he only knew the undercommon spoken four hundred years ago.

With gentle firmness, he grabbed the tiefling’s shoulders, steering him over to sit down at the table in a way that was not really a suggestion. Once settled, he turned to resume the teamaking he had begun in his place.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, February 3, 2023 1:39 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;As previously stated, just because you <em>can</em> function at your present level of pain doesn&#39;t mean you <em>should,</em>&quot; Luka said with a waggled finger. &quot;Listen to Valkyn if you won&#39;t listen to me. At least I can trust him to make sure you aren&#39;t overdoing it.&quot;

Hiraeth let out a long raspberry and folded his arms on the table, slumping down.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I am very assured you can function if you need. Making tea, you do not need. <em>Thirty-five percent pain reduction</em>. Is pain not worse after you push harder?&quot; He grunted flatly, sounding critical and unimpressed... but there was a certain gentility somewhere in his expression all the same.

&quot;You know limits best, yes. Does not mean you should always push to be at edge of limits. Not over <em>making tea</em>.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I understand,&quot; Luka said soothingly. &quot;Not everyone knows the difference between coddling and taking things off your plate so as not to overburden you.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Luka&#39;s eyes softened toward Valkyn. &quot;Of course. Happy to be of assistance.&quot; He stood up to shoulder his bag, reaching up to free some of his sunset curls from the strap. &quot;I can take off, if you don&#39;t need anything else.
