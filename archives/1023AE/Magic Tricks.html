It was a fun town, and the variety of individuals was endlessly delightful for Mint, who was learning <em>all</em> sorts of new things. (Centaurs, he had been disappointed to learn, were <em>not</em> ponies, and were <em>not</em> provided for rides.)

But hey, it was a beautiful day despite the chill in the air, and Mint was as chipper and goonish as always. Strolling through town, a stall caught his attention, first for the curious halfling individual manning it, and then as he paused to actually read what the stall was offering. Teach you <em>magic?</em> Teach you magic <em>long term</em> if you&#39;re any good at it? Hell yeah. Mint could be good at magic, he decided, already mentally drawing images of himself with a pointy wizard hat and staff, gibberish magic spells spewing out of the tip of the staff like chalk-drawing fireworks that lit up the sky. The armor stayed on, of course.

He&#39;d been walking down the street but seemed to twist last second towards the stall, momentum giving his body a bit of a comical swing as it followed after his legs until he stood more properly. Well, properly wasn&#39;t the right word. As he stood in front of the stall, his torso had leaned to the side, head tilted until his head was almost horizontal. Even without a visible expression, the curiosity emanated off of him.

Clung to the gauntlet of his right arm was his large unsheathed blade. Close inspection would note it clung on via six leggies, the pommel end of the blade ending in a sort of blunt face with pitch black eyes under a chitinous crown that looked almost sharklike in its bluntness. tendrils extended from the &#39;face&#39; of the blade and swayed idly in the wind.

&quot;You teach magic?&quot; He asked, attention wholly focused on Clicker. Or the Bird, as his head occasionally switched to gaze at. He wasn&#39;t sure which one was the one that actually did the lessons.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And when Mint passed by him, he let out a percussive set of several sharp sneezes, his sparsely-furred hand lifted to clamp over his nose, squinted watery eyes staring after him in bewildered awe. What in the unholy hells kind of combination of smells was this guy made up of?! Like a hag that had been marinating in stagnant swamp water and then vigorously farted on by smoke mephits and powdered with wood resin and fragrant herbs.

The sun was shining, the job they&#39;d stopped in this town for was both lucrative and satisfying to the sense of public justice, and they&#39;d walked away with some <em>very</em> interesting new bits and bobs. And she&#39;d found Fielbarry to be quite charming as well, with a colorful spectrum of inhabitants even in just the center of town where they&#39;d been staying. She and Mint were just additions to the canvas, having draped herself in her favorite teals and golds that morning to achieve a delicate pastel palette laid over the lavender of her skin and layered violet of her hair. Opting to forego the more practical densely braided plait, her hair hung in loose waves that danced about her waist at full length, pinned only with a thin and decorative looking stiletto spike that wound the loose strands away from her face in a half-bun. Despite the new toys they&#39;d picked up from the Necromancer&#39;s mansion, an aged and well-loved lyre of shining oiled wood remained faithfully strapped to her hip.

Her gait as they moved through the town was relaxed, taking in their surroundings as they moseyed and fashioning a mental map. Might as well familiarize, neither of them had developed any strong desire to move on yet. It took her a moment to notice that Mint had taken a near-windmill about-face to take a closer look at the magic stall they&#39;d just passed, and she paused to give the setup a once-over before sauntering back to it, a wry smile cracking the pleasant expression as she caught the hissing of the feline stranger and turned to look curiously at the halfling.
&quot;It <em>is</em> a very useful spell. Think of how much you&#39;d save on smoke breaks.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The stall itself was a relatively simple affair - a wooden front forming a desk and window, covered and backed by a simple canvas tent that would be little effort to pack up and move in the event of authorities getting on their case. Inside the tent area was a number of books, vials and implements that served to solidify the &quot;traveling wizard&quot; aesthetic the halfling seemed to cultivate.

As for the halfling themselves, their usual near-white blonde locks were now a substantially darker shade of red-brown, neatly combed and braided to rest between the convenient space formed by their horns. Their outfit was the usual shades of browns and greens, with some red-orange shades mixed in to match the late fall season. Aside from the belt tying their vest/dress combination together, all ornamentation they had was the light silver chain that a book was clasped to.

Watching Mint&#39;s cartoonish double-take and turnaround seemed to amuse them greatly as they clapped their hands together. &quot;A slight correction - I <em>attempt</em> to teach magic, friend. Whether you have the aptitude or not is something I have no say in just yet,&quot; they replied easily, looking to the sneezing tabaxi, and then the tiefling close to the armored individual. &quot;It is, it is! In fact, it just so happens to be the first spell many an aspiring worker of the Art practices!&quot; Leaning in as much as the tabletop allowed, they asked, &quot;Tell me, friend. Do you happen to have any experience with spells arcane or divine?&quot;

Beatrice, for her part, seemed more than happy to take the chance to hop onto the table as well, head bobbing this way and that as she inspected the assembled trio. Curious people, indeed.</span></div><div class="chatlog__attachment chatlog__attachment--hidden" onclick=showSpoiler(event,this)><div class=chatlog__attachment-spoiler-caption>SPOILER</div><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1178018470701564045/1178042410585042944/SPOILER_4bf6c85f128d4bee5474249bc3ea09c3.png?ex=659063fd&amp;is=657deefd&amp;hm=deb83cb48d2e4fe862fd2fd62ce3fcfcfcb04008d1b9232748767595ca1cc9f7&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1178018470701564045/1178042410585042944/SPOILER_4bf6c85f128d4bee5474249bc3ea09c3.png?ex=659063fd&amp;is=657deefd&amp;hm=deb83cb48d2e4fe862fd2fd62ce3fcfcfcb04008d1b9232748767595ca1cc9f7&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: SPOILER_4bf6c85f128d4bee5474249bc3ea09c3.png (771.14 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

Who do I have the pleasure of testing today?&quot;

While they gave the others time and space to respond, they took the time to write down the basics of the Prestidigitation cantrip in a book newly purchased just for this endeavour. With a black feather quill produced from seemingly nowhere, they sketched a surprisingly detailed glyph, annotated by more basic notes regarding the gestures required for the most generic form of the commonly used spell. At the bottom they also added a basic incantation written in Sylvan (albeit with the Common script rather than Elvish). &quot;Here you have it. If you&#39;ve found company with more individuals like your charming friend there, then you might&#39;ve noticed that most tend to add their own flourishes or simplifications as they grow more and more used to the work.

It really <em>had</em> been nice armor, once.

He accepted the book with barely restrained enthusiasm, holding it up close to his face with both hands. He muttered to himself for a few moments, though it wasn&#39;t hard to pick out pieces of the incantation in front of him in an absolutely butchered way. He tried it out a few different ways before settling on one particular butchering with confidence, raising a hand out to loudly declare the spell.

He paused, head tilting as nothing happened. Looking back to the diagram, he tried again with a new hand gesture and new abomination of pronunciation. Then again, with an increasingly wilder attempt, all said with the same confused confidence.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The smile only grew as she caught glimpse of the suspiciously green lines that covered the page of the book that Mint took in hand, and stepped back in a quiet sashay to... Give him space to read.

He stiffened in surprise as Beatrice attempted to swoop him - almost seeming to blink  with surprise as she blinked away. &quot;Woah.&quot; He muttered in awe. That seemed like a spell he wanted to learn.

Dusting off his armor, he settled back into standing properly, head tilting at Clicker again. &quot;How long did it take you to learn how to do presigentation?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Their eyes and horns were a reminder of this, as well as the many unseen hours they spent getting the spell just right.

Gods know their first attempt ended in disaster, but that was a story for another time.

&quot;Most of the hard work with spells is already done, heavens bless those that came before, and all we do is copy them and modify to suit ourselves. Some folk take a day, some a month, some a year, and some never quite get it right - all that&#39;s important is practicing as much as you can, and knowing whether or not you <em>want</em> to learn.&quot;

They held out a hand for the book again and - assuming Mint returned it - neatly wrote the name of the spell above the casting instructions, with an added note saying &#39;presti or presto for short, dear.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The weather did not appear to be on his mind, though, as the small circus that had presented itself seemed to have their full attention for the moment. 

Kel&#39;s forward momentum had been abandoned as he stared, his expression blank, trying to make sense of what he had been watching. In his hands was a simple but pretty ceramic mug of sorts, but fitted with a lid and straw; he was otherwise emptyhanded, with no indication of what business he had been up to that now was undoubtedly permanently forgotten about.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Regardless of where he actually placed his ability to learn prestidigitiation on that timeline, he seemed pacified for the time being, even with the laughing and gawking.

Well, mostly. Catching the glances of the crowds, he handed over the book in favor of tugging a stick of incense from the folds of his armor, giving it a quick light to let it just burn next to him. It did little to completely block out his normal scent, but at least it was better than nothing.

He accepted the book back with a little thanks, giving it another look over before nodding again and tucking it into the folds of his armor garb as well. &quot;Oh, I definitely wanna learn.

&quot;Just down the way you&#39;ll find a pretty good place for more refined palettes, as well.

Pest&#39;s order to stay downwind of food was a familiar one at least, reminding Mint of many of his previous misadventures before meeting Vega. He let out a little laugh despite it and pinched off the ember of his incense stick, tucking the unburnt half back into a spot for safe keeping.

I&#39;ll have the fried calamari rings - they haven&#39;t let me down yet,&quot; they said with a smile. Free food was free food, after all, and they were more than confident enough that this wasn&#39;t a wide-angled attempt on their life.

Seeing Vega&#39;s trick on their new tabaxi acquaintance only widened the smile on their face. Sure, it&#39;d wear off after a while, but the thought of him more or less chasing his own tail for the next hour or so was an amusing thought - and something they&#39;d have to watch again later with the help of other onlookers. It&#39;s just a shame they hadn&#39;t had the opportunity to do it themselves.

Knowing that a certain someone <em>would</em> try to kill them if they didn&#39;t allow them to join in, however, the small wizard snapped their fingers. In a puff of red and grey smoke, Beatrice reappeared next to the halfling - none too happy at the previous interruption. &quot;I still don&#39;t agree with you teaching these people...&quot; 
&quot;I know.&quot;
&quot;Then why...&quot;
&quot;Hush, Beatrice. Everyone deserves to try, at least, and our new friend doesn&#39;t lack enthusiasm.&quot;
&quot;Bastard-born... fine. The fragrant one can stay, but I won&#39;t be part of his training.&quot;
&quot;I know.&quot;
And with that, the matter was settled. At least for now. Though the raven seemed none too pleased by Mint, still, she shut up for the time being - partially in the hopes of scoring some of those calamari rings in the near future.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Shifting to open the interaction to Mint and Clicker, her expression turned curious as the raven made another appearance, and she tuned into the last of their interaction with a tilt of her head.

His hand bonked lightly against the metal of his helmet instead.

He cleared his throat as Vega drifted near, head turning towards her at the question before he shook it. &quot;-Oh, no thank you Miss Vega, I&#39;m still good.&quot;

He gave an exaggerated rub of his tummy and a little pat before pausing, head glancing the genasi&#39;s way curiously. &quot;.. though I bet uh, Frank might want a little bite. If that&#39;s okay.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He reached a hand over, a singular finger scritching along the sharply blunt ‘horn’ of chitin above the eyes in example. “Right up here’s good.” He instructed before offering his arm towards the halfling.

&quot;He likes that too.&quot; Mint nodded happily in approval, and Clicker was free to pat to their contentment.

And as the breeze trickled his way, his own sensitive nose caught wind of the distressing smell, and he crinkled up his nose and lifted his hand to cover his nose and mouth in disgust.

The gaggle of seven wolf-dog puppies around his feet had also frozen in their playful tottering at the sound, and a couple went to scamper back behind Kaleva&#39;s legs while a couple of the braver ones inched toward the tabaxi, hackles lifted in brazen curiosity.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

So instead, Skena was bundled up almost more than the cooler, late-fall air even deemed necessary, a couple different layers of robe-dress-poncho-shawl almost giving her enough dimension to not look like a little stick person or lost child.

But even though the garb appeared a bit more glum than the pastels of her summer wardrobe, there was no hiding the small but pretty halo that radiated a gentle, golden glow around the crown of her head, like a little thread of stardust orbiting her visage. Unassuming and not bright enough to immediately be eye-catching, but impossible to miss when looking at her properly. And the pleasantness of the sight <em>almost</em> offset her gaunt and corpsey features, and her rather alien-looking eyes that had also landed on the gagging tabaxi.

Either she couldn&#39;t smell the odor, or she was just... uncannily immune to foul odors.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The calamari ring had gone flying as the sword moved from clinging to Mint&#39;s gauntlet and into his hand in a smooth motion that was followed through with some dramatic swings and slashes.

&quot;I totally cut down like, 4 guys at once, but this other guy had snuck up behind me with a big ol spear and was about to skewer me but Miss Vega bopped that shit right out of his hands and totally made him piss his pants.&quot;

As they trundled down the street on their way to the apothecary to buy more bottles to store sap, they came across quite a curious scene. Blinking wide eyes, Clove&#39;s earlier plan was immediately discarded and their footsteps quickly brought them over to the charmingly playful puppies and group gathered around it.

Today, Clove wore a muted orange cloak that was thick and warm over their customary clothes. It was enough to keep the chill off them, and the nice weather meant Clove was still able to go barefoot (although they knew their days of doing so remaining comfortable were waning). Today, Clove&#39;s mushroom hat was their classic oversized red one with big white dots.

Skena&#39;s curious eye might eventually land on a new addition to Clove&#39;s ensemble, a staff sized perfectly to the goblin&#39;s diminutive form and currently clutched in Clove&#39;s other hand. Atop the staff perched a snail roughly the size of an apple. The eye-stalks of the snail seemed to bob and weave through the air, as though it were sensing the world around them.

At a particularly enthusiastic lick that caused the acorn charm on their ear to make a merry jingling sound, Clove giggled. Although the puppies were squirmy and active, they didn&#39;t seem to be playing so rough that Clove feared they&#39;d be hurt, and thus made no attempt to extract themselves from the swarm.

&quot;You&#39;re so pretty. I like your mismatched eyes,&quot; Clove was speaking to the puppy who&#39;d parked in front of them for ear scritches, one of the pups with heterochromia who they also fed a minnow treat. 

&quot;And thank you,&quot; Clove replied shyly to Skena. &quot;They are very big but they already know how to play nice with small creatures. They must have good caretakers.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Kaleva, more focused on Clove and the puppies, gestured to them and then to Clove, a questioning look on his face. It seemed he wasn&#39;t really talkative at the moment, but he seemed to be trying to convey if Clove had any interest in adopting any of them.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Musing pushed to the side for that moment, they gestured this way and that with a hand. &quot;I travelled here and there, picking up odd jobs and seeing if I could find a body or two that had intentions of learning more of the Art.&quot; Just in case the start of the day was forgotten, they gestured to the unattended stall not so far away from them. &quot;I do dabble in the business of problem solving from time to time, truthfully.

The snail&#39;s bobbing and weaving eye stalks danced around the puppy&#39;s snout as the pup came in for the gentlest of nose boops. The snail appeared not to mind (and it was debatable if the snail really acknowledged the puppy). The puppy focused mightily on the snail&#39;s movements, gaze intent and slightly cross-eyed due to the short distance, until a brush of eye stalk itched his nose in just a way to make the puppy sneeze. 

Laughing again in delight at the interaction, Clove turned to catch Kaleva&#39;s questioning look before glancing back to the puppy in front of them with a keen eye. &quot;If this friend isn&#39;t spoken for...&quot; Clove quickly checked the belly of the puppy to confirm sex before continuing, &quot;He would make a very nice friend for Clove...&quot; Their tone was wistful as they continued petting, alternating between ear scritches and generally admiring the puppy&#39;s thick, fluffy coat.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Kaleva’s voice was a pleasant surprise for her to hear, and as all parties ended up moving into slightly closer proximity, she headed over to stand at his side and rest her shoulder against his, wordlessly supportive of the push beyond his recently rather starkly reduced comfort zone.

Continuing to stroke the puppy&#39;s soft ears, Clove thought carefully before replying to Kaleva and Skena. &quot;A couple of weeks could be nice for me to learn more about puppies. I can help you take care of them to say thank you for teaching me, if you want.&quot; They scuffed at the dry dusty earth at their feet with a toe, body posture a little shy as they pursed their lips slightly in the effort of thought. &quot;I&#39;ve helped rehabilitate wild animals before, but never had a pet of my own. My mentor has helped me then. Some of my sisters kept rabbits, though, and sometimes we would blend their shed fur when we were spinning yarn for clothes.&quot;

As Skena mentioned becoming better acquainted, Clove blinked, realizing they&#39;d probably been rude to the other member of the small conversational circle in their quick and utter fixation on the puppies. This time Pest was the beneficiary of Clove&#39;s toothy grin. &quot;Oh, um. Hi by the way! I&#39;m Clove; I have been in town a while, but I&#39;m often out in the surround lands foraging.

The reason why became apparent as Atreyu walked off after the puppy and simply scooped her up in his mouth. Didn&#39;t grab her by the scruff. Just completely encased her entire body in his mouth and brought her back over, where he opened his maw and deposited her back with her siblings. She was panting happily and covered in spit as she rolled back to her feet. Clearly not her first rodeo with this process. &quot;You&#39;ll... have plenty of fur with him... Every spring and fall. Guaranteed.&quot;

Pest happily plucked up the minnow and crunched it up in his sharp teeth, chewing a bit before swallowing it down and licking his fingers. &quot;Good eatin&#39;.&quot; He blinked at Clove, and gave them a confused grin. &quot;Lots of people today named after plants. At least you don&#39;t reek. I&#39;m Tempest in a Teapot - Tempest or Pest for short. I&#39;m not with the guild, but it looks like good money.

There was a small clearing where several varieties of songbirds had made their nests that Clove knew of in the forest nearby; they wondered if the birds there would appreciate such fluffy down to line their nests with. The sparrows that called the swamp where Clove&#39;s family lived had certainly appreciated the rabbit shed that was too short to spin into yarn.

If it were possible for Clove&#39;s eyes to widen further, they did as the comparatively even larger hound approached. &quot;Is that how big the puppies will get?&quot; they wondered softly to Kaleva.

With another shy smile, Clove offered the minnows back to Skena, in case she wanted to share more with Tempest, or the other puppies. &quot;Most of my siblings are named after plants. Did you... did you see another goblin here?&quot; Clove&#39;s tone was clearly hesitant as they posed the question to Tempest, and a slightly worried look flit across their face as they craned their head around, searching the surrounding street.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Atreyu walked over to Clove, leaning down to sniff at them, his tail waving in friendly greeting. He definitely looked different from the puppies, with a long snout, floppy ears, and a lean, deer-like build with a deep chest and a narrow waist. Clearly built more for speed than power.

Pest, meanwhile, pointed back over to where Mint and Vega were having lunch with Clicker. &quot;Nah, unless the armored one is one really big-ass goblin. Swamp-stank. Dill? I think his name was Dill.&quot; He paused, then snorted. &quot;Dill-weed.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was probably an odd sight. The tiefling walking up to them with a sort of resigned purpose, only to approach them, stare at them as though he had suddenly gotten himself into something he had no idea how to deal with, and after a long and awkward moment, ducked his head and quickly shuffled back over to Skena and the rest.

Pest stared at him for a long moment, then let out a &quot;<em>PFFT!</em>&quot; and broke into laughter. &quot;What was that??&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

With an arm subtly but firmly encircling his waist in wordless support, she ushered him back to where he had originally walked up to the other strangers, almost managing to make it look like one cohesive approach with how swiftly she involved herself.

&quot;Hey! Sorry, we--we just met the acquaintance of that tabaxi, and he pointed you out, but forgot your name,&quot; she said, addressing the smelly assimilation of featureless armor. &quot;I&#39;m curious how close our guesses were--what was it, if you don&#39;t mind?&quot;

Skena herself was starkly introverted. But then, it was always easier to be bold when it was on behalf of your loved ones.

Just how someone was supposed to use magic to aid in childbirth Mint had no idea. His imagination stirred once again as he tried to think, the idea disappearing as he noted Kaleva&#39;s approach. &quot;Oh, hi there.&quot;

He paused as Kaleva did, head and torso tilting to the side as he turned around in retreat. &quot;Huh??&quot;

At Skena&#39;s rescue and consequent questions, he slid himself back to stand up straight in a fluid motion, the grill of his helmet turning to face her. &quot;Oh, you met Pest?&quot; He asked, looking down the way to see him... And a whole lotta puppies. He gasped with delight, distracted from her question. &quot;You brought puppies? I wanna pet em. I&#39;m gonna pet em- <em>ooooo</em> I&#39;m gonna pet em so good.&quot;

&quot;&#39;sides, there&#39;s a certain satisfaction in the more mundane way of doing things from time to time. It&#39;s much more personal...&quot; they explained further, but trailed off as the hound party approached.

Their eyes drifted over the closest pair, brow quirked at the sight of aasimar and tiefling friendly with one another. Fielbarry was known as a slight oddity as far as towns went, but, for whatever reason, they still found it amusingly idyllic.

Looking further, they spotted their new feline acquaintance and a third new face. This one did <em>not</em> require them to look skywards at the chance of a proper conversation, as well, and so the halfling made their way over to the dogs and goblin. &quot;Fates be kind, it&#39;s wonderful to see someone my size in town for once.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Curious indeed.

Her attention drifted as Mint&#39;s did, brow raising in intrigue at the tiefling that approached them just to about-face and wander back from whence he came. Blinking her surprise, she exchanged a look with Mint, and turned back to the approaching ensemble with a raised brow and a quirked smile.
At Mint&#39;s complete subversion of pleasantries her expression mellowed into a polite smile despite how deeply it amused her, and she folded her hands over her stomach.
&quot;My companion here is Mint, as you can see he is an enthusiastic liver of life. My name is Vega,&quot; she offered, dipping into a small bow. &quot;Its a pleasure.&quot;

Of course, he promptly lost his own nerve and scrambled back out of smell distance. &quot;It was <em>great</em> once I stopped gagging!&quot; he yowled at Vega despairingly.

Dogs, however, were not cats, and they thought Mint smelled <em>amazing.</em> They swarmed him and started sniffing him enthusiastically and even tried rubbing themselves on his armor.

At least <em>someone</em> appreciated how he smelled. He squatted amidst them with a delighted laugh, cooing as he reached out to deposit scritches and dotes without a care of how much they rubbed against him.

The blade gripping his wrist had backed up away from the puppies until it clung to a shoulder pad, away from prying maws and bumbling paws. Perhaps for the best considering the blade looked sharp, especially without any sort of scabbard to defend against curious animals. From the safety of it&#39;s perch, those curious tendrils waved in the puppies directions, occasionally brave enough to dip close enough to place a gentol touch before drawing high again with a quick twitch.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Their innate curiosity often meant that they got in a little over their head, so in this they empathized with Kaleva&#39;s husky. Plus, it was hard to argue with the adorable end result frolicking around at their feet (or shoulders, in the case of the diminutive goblin).

At Atreyu&#39;s friendly wag, Clove reached up on their tippy toes to say hello with gentle pets to his snout. They continued as such while the small group listed off various spices, and their stomach gave a cheerful gurgle, causing Clove to laugh as they spoke. &quot;My tummy thinks we are listing all these spices because it&#39;s food time.&quot;

As Kaleva and the Skena made their way over to the other gaggle, Clove followed, giving the puppy they&#39;d expressed an interest in befriending a little click of their tongue to try and lure him along.

Clove brightened as Clicker said hello, and they spoke back confidently. &quot;I am the best height, so you are too. My name is Clove.&quot; Accompanying their verbal introduction, the little goblin gave an exaggerated curtsy, knocking their mushroom hat slightly askew in their eagerness. As their hat fell down to rest on Clove&#39;s back thanks to a strap installed for just these occasions, Clove scanned the new faces. Having grown up in a swamp, Clove was used to a variety of scents, and found that they weren&#39;t quite as affronted by Mint as others were.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In that regard, at least, Pest had served as a good indicator that there was something unusual about it. 

Even Beatrice seemed more offended by his apparent lack of magical ability than anything else, though she was now hopping around Clove, inspecting the goblin and her pubby.

&quot;I&#39;d agree, but being this height certainly has its downsides in towns built for people twice our size,&quot; Clicker said with a smile. &quot;Pleased to meetcha, Clove. The name&#39;s Clicker, and my curious bird friend&#39;s Beatrice.&quot; Their introduction was also followed by a curtsy, since it seemed to be the gesture of the day. Thankfully they had no hat to knock loose, having left it behind in their stall.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
