Occasionally, when he liked to be, or needed something. He&#39;d do just about anything to make a quick coin in town, and then spend it all every evening he could in the tavern. Such a lifestyle made for an interesting change in scenery every day, but waking up in a new location most nights (whether they were meant for sleeping or were simply some corner he crawled to before passing out for the evening) was hell on his back. He lazily walked through town, back arching slight as he pressed his knuckles up and down his back to ease some part of the soreness away.

Luckily, he remembered there was a certain cute therapist in town who could fix that. With newfound purpose he glanced around for Luka&#39;s practice, finding it after a few twists and turns down the streets of Fielbarry. He grinned in triumph, striding up to the door; surely there wasn&#39;t more than one massage parlor in town. Now all he had to hope for was it being open. He gave the handle a testing twist, waltzing in if it was open.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A small string of delicate chimes were disturbed by Yarrow&#39;s entrance, announcing his presence. The interior had a warm, cozy vibe to it. A waiting area with plush chairs, a bookshelf, and a table with a cold water pitcher and glasses available, a front desk made of carved mahogany. The trickling sound of water was a constant, and came from an indoor koi pond framed by lush vegetation.

There was a little sign set up on the desk that said &#39;Massage in progress, please be patient! I will be available to help you at 11:00,&#39; next to a small clock on the desk. Yarrow had about a ten minute wait to look around and make himself comfortable.

At almost 11 on the dot, Luka slipped out from the back, hair tied back in a ponytail with a few stray curls framing his face, the sleeves of his white tunic snugly rolled up around his elbows and tucked into brown pinstripe slacks. His butter yellow eyes brightened with warmth upon spotting him. &quot;Well good morning, Yarrow.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Magpies weren&#39;t exactly a very calming presence--though at least this one didn&#39;t seem to be actively being a terror, as it somewhat awkwardly seemed to be working on folding some hand towels with its beak, feet, and semi-frequent fluttering hops. It was slow progress by the looks of it, but you couldn&#39;t really blame a bird for having trouble doing laundry. 

The creature paused as Yarrow entered, head tilted up to regard him with one eye at a time... before going back to &quot;folding&quot;, while occasionally glancing over to keep an eye on him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He inhaled deeply, letting out a satisfied sigh with a somewhat genuine smile. Hands stuffing into his pockets, he slowly spun to admire the whole of the interior, noting the clever inclusion of the pond and purposefully beautiful decor. &quot;Haven&#39;t been to one of these in a while.&quot; He murmured to himself.

Walking up to the desk, he glanced to the sign, peeking over the counter briefly before moseying over to sprawl on one of the chairs. He sunk in with another sigh, hands folding behind his head. All he had to do was wait. Wait, and watch a bird do the folding. He smirked as it toiled, and paused to regard him too. Though most parlors he&#39;d been in hadn&#39;t had birds he wasn&#39;t against it. It was almost cute, in a way, watching it struggle to fold with just a beak.

Entertainment aside, that&#39;s not what he was here for. Luka, strolling out of the back with an ever present pleasantness about him, was. Yarrow smiled, slowly peeling himself free of the plushy confines to wave. &quot;Morning, Luka. Fancy place you got here. Whose idea was it to have a pond in here exactly?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Creating a relaxing atmosphere. It&#39;s also prime entertainment for my cat.&quot; He paused briefly to look over the magpie&#39;s work, reaching out to brush a knuckle against the bird&#39;s cheek in approval. &quot;You&#39;re doing lovely work, thank you.&quot;

Attention turned back to Yarrow, he leaned his hip lightly against the desk, arms loosely folded. &quot;So is this a social visit, or were you looking for a massage?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A beat.

&quot;<em>And not locker-room style towel smacking, that is absolutely not what I was referring to, so don&#39;t--</em>&quot;

The door opened behind him, and a second tiefling made his way out, this one with ashy gray skin, striking tribal facial tattoos, long, pale lichen green hair, glasses framing raspberry red eyes, and a set of horns that looked like deer antlers. He walked with a terrible limp and was assisted with an aspen quarterstaff topped with a sprig of mistletoe. Luka immediately turned to him with a bright smile. &quot;See you next week then, Hiraeth, if not sooner?&quot;

The rather druidic-looking tiefling spared Yarrow an amused glance, clearly having heard something or other. &quot;I&#39;ll see you then, Luka. Good luck?&quot;

His smile eased a little as Hiraeth came out, curiosity over his unique appearance overtaking his ever-present need to tease for the time being, instead listening in the best affording semblance of politeness that he could offer while they exchanged goodbyes and well-wishes.

Eyes turned to him, and he raised his hands back up again. &quot;I <em>can</em> behave!&quot; he insisted, though he hardly looked like he ever committed to the idea of it. &quot;If absolute quiet is what you need from me, mum&#39;s the word.

Yarrow, perhaps to Luka&#39;s relief, headed into the changing room on the left <em>before</em> beginning to strip. He tossed his clothes off without a care to where they landed or how frumpled of a mess they made. He paused, toying with one of his many bejeweled necklaces before carefully pulling them off, setting them aside with far more tenderness than the rest of his outfit. He left his earrings, bracelets, and rings on, figuring there was no need to remove them if this was simply a back massage. Though he hesitated leaving the necklaces aside, he wrapped a fresh towel around his waist and donned a robe, rough fingers smoothing over the soft fabric in satisfaction.

He moved to the back room, leaning against the entryway frame in a lazy pose, one elbow propped up above his head, hand cradling his cheek while the other hand rested on his waist. &quot;I&#39;m ready.~&quot; He said in teasing dramatics.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

With the robe off, it was far easier to see the trails of thorns that sprouted up along his collarbones, forearms.. even a trail starting from his big toe that curved around his outer calf. His back had a trail as well, one that thankfully only trailed down his spine. Luka wouldn&#39;t have to worry about pricking himself on them if he kept to Yarrow&#39;s muscles, not that they were terribly sharp to the touch. Similar patterns of thorns seemed to tattoo the surface of his skin in ripping waves that followed musculature, though they were hard to see in the low light and barely held any sensation under the fingertips. It gave more of the impression he&#39;d been molded like clay from a bramble into the shape of a man, smoothed over until barely a trace of the source remained.

Remembering himself, he glanced over his shoulder up at Luka as he finished settling. &quot;Oh right, don&#39;t mind the thorns. They get a little tender sometimes, but they shouldn&#39;t hurt you or anything.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He reached an arm around his back and wiggled one of the thorns with a chuckle. &quot;They&#39;re a little flexible.

I&#39;m going to start you off with some moist heat to relax things a bit before I get to work.&quot;

He went over to where a small wood stove had been providing some pleasant warmth to the room, opening what seemed to be a cabinet built in above it. Steam misted out from it, and he removed a blanket with small glass beads sewn into pockets to give it weight, that had been infused with steam from the basin of water at the bottom and was now pleasantly warm, bringing it over to settle it over Yarrow&#39;s back, neck, and shoulders.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;To answer your question, they don&#39;t really snag on anything normally. Not unless I&#39;m already pissed off and just one more annoyance is all it&#39;ll take, heh.

Not that he assumed &#39;learning to be firm&#39; was quite the same as &#39;getting kidnapped by pirates.&#39; Not to mention all the other shit. He cleared his throat lightly. &quot;That&#39;s an interesting way to put it. It&#39;s a useful skill though, that&#39;s for sure.&quot;

He paused for a moment as Luka offered to work with him and his more sporadic budget. On one hand, having another thing he&#39;d have to budget for besides booze and sex sounded awful and annoying. On the other hand... he did enjoy this, and he also enjoyed talking to (and teasing) Luka. Yeah. He could budget for that.

&quot;I... appreciate that. Thank you, Luka. I&#39;d kiss you for it, though I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the kind of payment you&#39;re looking for. Not that I&#39;m trying to make moves on a taken man.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was thankful this gave him time to think about how to explain this in the least shitty way.

&quot;Well... It was either die, or join them when I first was captured, so... I joined em.

It was a weird feeling, to not be proud of something he&#39;d <em>probably</em> go back and do again anyways. He cleared his throat, shaking his head. When he spoke up again, his voice held a bit more of that lighter, brushing-it-off tone he usually carried. &quot;Anyways, long story short is I was a shit pirate and the captain hated me, so I got the boot.

There&#39;s a shower if you want to rinse off, and please remember to drink a lot of water today to rehydrate your muscles and flush out the toxins. Take your time, I don&#39;t have any other clients booked for another couple of hours.&quot;

He stepped out and almost tripped over the magpie that had been eavesdropping, gasping. &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry, Szix. What in the world are you doing there? Come along now.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It&#39;s just a bird, after all.

Shaking his head, he finally pulled off the table to wobble onto his feet and into the promised shower. The water was a second blessing that cleared the drowsiness from his head and further soothed the released ache in his back and shoulders. He could get used to this again. 

Squeaking the water off, he toweled off and redressed, feeling a thousand times better than when he walked in. Even his usual step had a bit more pep to it. &quot;Y&#39;know Luka, I stand by what I said. You&#39;re an angel with magic hands and a healing touch.

Jaska muttered something about getting a menu in braille and skulked off to the counter, returning shortly after and setting it down in front of Val. Upside down. Hard to say if he realized that or was just being cheeky.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Besides, it was normal to be familiar with someone&#39;s family if you were pursuing them with any serious interest, wasn&#39;t it? Valentine he was definitely already familiar with, though Jaska&#39;s irritable inclusion was promising.

&quot;Hey, that&#39;s perfectly fine with me. Just as long as they don&#39;t expect me to pay for their lunches today as well.. Luka, in his infinite kindness and understanding of a limited budget, has let me pay for his services in food today.&quot; Yarrow smiled, arms spreading wide in praise for a moment before he kicked back, one arm propped up over the back of the chair with a leg kicked up over the other knee.

He picked up his own menu, giving it a glance with mild interest. &quot;Turkey and fig spread with brie sounds good. What do you think?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Oh, rest assured, I have no interest in mooching,&quot; Val replied warmly after that nonverbal beat towards her younger brother, turning to cast a usual smile towards Yarrow. &quot;Jaska simply invited me out for a drink--with the implied novelty being that it was not a drink of my own making--but it is always serendipitous to run into the rest of my family,&quot; she added with a slightly softer smile towards Luka. &quot;So I certainly can&#39;t complain about having this drink in Luka&#39;s company, as well.&quot;

Szix, amidst all this, had hopped to perch from Luka&#39;s shoulder onto the back of his chair, seeming to neatly keep to himself and keep his beak shut--especially in the presence of Jaska and Val. The presence of <em>at least</em> Jaska and Val; the magpie&#39;s beady eyes seemed to be a bit restless looking around for something not yet accounted for.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Somewhere nearby,&quot; Jaska said, a keen eye taking a glance around. &quot;If she wants to come down and join us, she can. We&#39;ve already eaten, so I&#39;m just getting coffee.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He nodded at Luka&#39;s guess regarding figs, expanding a bit. &quot;They&#39;re pretty common in Siscia, but they don&#39;t stay fresh for long, so the most I&#39;ve really found around here has been in jams or dried. Shame you&#39;re not hungry, otherwise I&#39;d recommend trying it.&quot;

Yarrow quirked a brow at Szix&#39;s more muted posture, noting the mention of Axa. He too took a look around, first glancing towards the ceiling of the cafe. &quot;She&#39;s here too, hm? Hanging out on the walls again?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Oh, no, I understand. I&#39;ll take him outside,&quot; Luka said soothingly, and stood up to gather up Szix. &quot;Be right back,&quot; he said to the others as he went to step outside.

He cleared his throat, steeling himself with an attempted smile as Luka withdrew Szix. He placed his order and uncrossed his legs lest he repeat the damage, looking to Jaska as he addressed him.

Exhaling through his nose, he lazily raised his hands in a mock surrender and shrugged. &quot;I&#39;m just flattered you care that much about my opinions, Jaska. I&#39;m touched, really.&quot;

Jaska, meanwhile, gave Yarrow an unimpressed stare. &quot;Don&#39;t be flattered. I wasn&#39;t interested in your opinion, but if you were going to behave in a manner that would upset Axa, I would have to jump you in a dark alley somewhere and kill you.&quot;

Luka sighed, long and resigned, lowering his head into his hand.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He paused, adding with an almost regretful grumble &quot;Had a job lined up for the morning, but I slept poorly and didn&#39;t wake up in time for it. I&#39;m more of a night owl nowadays anyways.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
