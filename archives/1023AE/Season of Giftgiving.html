This morning however, the usual chattering and gentle howling was also broken by the echo of conversation and the steady pace of hooves against the earth.

Niamh had reached the point of comfort with their pegasus friend that she felt comfortable keeping her updated on all the goings-on in town, despite the horse not being much of a conversationalist. She was a good listener though, and usually seemed amused by the business of the townspeople. After running into her en route to Nils and Cassiana&#39;s home, it only made sense to Niamh that she should join them and maybe even get herself a slice of cake, depending on which of the inhabitants would cave to her gentle snuffing requests first. The cake itself was not purchased with equine diets in mind, though, and had remained in its box untouched since being picked up - despite the best efforts of the small round-eyed creature wrapped around Niamh&#39;s wrist and furiously attempting to pry his fidgety little toes under the lip of the box, secured tightly under Niamh&#39;s grip.
She continued to ignore him and his feverish little patting noises, instead opting to fill the pegasus in on the excitement of the holiday gift exchange and the battle over the frog hampers she&#39;d brought.
&quot;... I really thought she might stab him by the time the exchange ended, but apparently they&#39;re friends. Not that that precludes you from stabbing someone, but still. Ah.&quot; The familiar pair of residences came into view as they rounded the last bend in the path, and Niamh paused only to double check that the awkwardly shaped package in her satchel was still there. It was, of course - it would have been loudly announced if it had fallen out, but she afforded herself a glance nonetheless before closing in on the home and calling out towards the door.
&quot;I ran into a friend on the way!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Besides, Fielbarry didn&#39;t get nearly as cold as Holbrook.

It was also deeply common for Cha Cha to be loitering at the Stefanson residence, as practically a part-time resident himself. This was one such occasion, and... Cassiana had taken the opportunity to silently send a message into Niamh&#39;s thoughts at the other shifter&#39;s arrival, informing her that now would be a very good time to drop by.

And so Cass, at least, expected her. Rising to her feet (or rather, foot), she hobbled to the door to welcome Niamh in with her usual, rather sleepy smile. 

&quot;Come warm yourself up, then. The tea is still fresh. And hello to you,&quot; she murmured, nodding to the pegasus behind her.

The pegasus might not have been much for conversation, but she seemed to be a very astute listener. Niamh had her full attention as she chatted away, and there was even the occasional little snort that seemed uncannily similar to responsive chuckles to certain parts of her stories. The pegasus had also originally come from farther up north, and so this weather did not seem to bother her in the slightest, her coat naturally growing a very not-horse-like scruff of fur around her chest, almost like the mane of a lion, which seemed to keep her comfortable enough.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Thursday, March 2, 2023 9:30 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He wore a loose long sleeved shirt, though said sleeves had been pushed up to the elbows to expose his forearms.

I got a whole bucket full of chestnuts I can bring over, too.&quot;

Similarly to Cha Cha, he was dressed in a loose v-necked tunic with wide sleeves and a belt around the middle over simple breeches.

&quot;Appreciate it!

After a moment of chewing, she nodded and held the rest of the slice up for inspection, humming her approval.
&quot;That&#39;s surprisingly sweet? I like this version, definitely let me know next time - I&#39;ll bring something from home as trade. Havent had decent access to a kitchen in months,&quot; she added in muttered tones, frowning down at the satchel as Cha Cha asked after it.
&quot;Oh, they&#39;re gifts of course - holidays and all that, right?&quot; Popping the rest of the pemmican in her mouth, she set about fishing through the bottom of the bag for a small velvet pouch, ignoring the larger and more obvious package for the moment.
&quot;Back home is, well. Winter&#39;s Crest is a bit different when Winter isn&#39;t such a distinct season. For us its more a celebration of the days getting longer again, the transition and renewal and all that. We don&#39;t give gifts quite the same as you do, but we do celebrate with our loved ones.&quot;
Tossing the bag unceremoniously back onto the table, Niamh gently laid out three finely woven bracelets across her hand, each one distinct and finished with a tiny silver charm.
The first one that she plucked from her palm had no patterns but instead a gradual shift in color, from a deep charcoal to glimmering silver where tiny glass beads had been worked into the design, replacing knots within the rows of weaving where they instead sparkled merrily. Braided into the tassels intended for securing the piece was a tiny silver lantern, fully dimensional with an even smaller silver flame nestled inside it. With an eager grin on her face, Niamh walked it to where Cass sat, pushing the layers of wool blanket out of her face to see into her hands better.
&quot;You all up north aren&#39;t as superstitious as sailors so they&#39;re little more than trinkets, but to us its commonplace to trade these with your friends and loved ones as the days start to grow long again. They&#39;re protective charms.&quot;
The second one tugged free was a solid cream color, the dense weave broken up by the intermittent placement of cylindrical beads of sunset orange jasper. Where the knots thinned into a single braid, a tiny shield hung. The second one, she presented to Nils with a flourish, and continued her explanation.
&quot;The idea is that you wear them until they fall off - which they are intended to do, obviously they&#39;re not made from the strongest materials. But they protect you until they do, and when they break thats how you know that they&#39;ve fulfilled their purpose.&quot;
The last one was pinched between her fingers, and held aloft for Cha Cha to examine. The dark mahogany knotwork was set in a cluster pattern that created a raised diamond texture, though the entirety of it did not consist of the silken threads that the other two did - instead, the weave was suspended between two lengths of leather cord, a silver portrait of a keen eyed bear lain flat between them at one end.
&quot;&#39;Course there&#39;s no pressure or anything to wear them,&quot; she added hastily, waving a hand dismissively, &quot;But i made a bunch to send home &#39;n it felt wrong not to make some for you all here too.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Smiling softly, she reached out to accept the little charm, turning it over between her hand and the smoky imitation of its twin, admiring the craftsmanship.

&quot;... <em>Superstitious</em> is a strange word,&quot; she murmured after a moment. &quot;It tends to imply some sort of irrationality to it. As if the person who is labeled <em>superstitious</em> is overreacting, or what they fear is solely within their own mind.&quot;

She looked up--not towards Niamh, but towards the pegasus in the doorway, strangely not looking the least bit surprised to see a strange vulture standing in the snow behind her, eyeing what it could spy of the interior home. Its feathers were dark, but had a ruddy hue to them, and it was built thick and fluffy with feathers, including black, narrow ones that created tear-like markings down the inner corners of its <em>bright red</em> eyes. 

It stared back at Cassiana for a moment, before spreading its wings and taking off from the ground, lazy but heavy flaps carrying it out of sight, until a faint noise on the roof seemed to signal where it had relocated itself.

Unperturbed, Cass&#39; glassy gaze slid back to Niamh with her usual, sleepy smile. &quot;I am unfamiliar with customs in the far south, but it is what some would label as <em>superstition</em> to credit for my being present in this room at all. This is a strange world... but everything matters. Thank you, Niamh.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He leaned forward a little as she explained, squinting down at the trio of bracelets to admire them. Though she waved off the evident superstition behind it, it was all the nicer to hear such little wishes woven into the knots themselves, for their safety.

He pried an arm free, gingerly reaching out to accept the mahogany bracelet and bring it close for a full examination, laying it across the palm of his other hand to twist it in the gentle light. Even as she further waved away any pressure regarding wearing them, he set about clasping it around one burly wrist with swift determination.

It was actually a very good size for Cha Cha, and was certainly lighter than his prior shield had been. The interior of it was layered in tough, dark-brown leather that made it quite comfortable to wield, too. 

The quality was evident in every detail of it. And even though Cha Cha himself was no spellcaster, even he could grasp an abstract depth to the item beyond just the mundane material parts.

His finger hovered in front of Niamh for a moment with a squint. &quot;.. Might have yours with me. Gimme a moment.&quot;

He paused to give them an apologetic smile. &quot;They&#39;re uh, not wrapped. So no real surprises or nothin.&quot;

Both hands descended into the pack, withdrawing at the same time a pair of wooden steins. Both were hand-carved from a single piece of wood, with thin metal bands for decoration. For the one he handed to Nils, the top of the handle was carved into the likeness of a buck, simple horns curving out and looping back into the main of the stein to accentuate the curve of the head similarly curving back as the top of the handle. A raised leg carved into the cup of the stein, and knotwork decorated the top and bottom.

For the one he handed to Cass, a fox was carved, curved in the opposite direction so that the two beasts could face one another when set up on a shelf. The placid eyes bore a similar likeness to the elf it was meant for, a paw raised in similar curve to mimic the buck. The same knotwork decorated the top and bottom for hers as well, and both mugs had been sanded and polished to a fine finish.

To Niamh, he gave her a small glance. &quot;It ain&#39;t finished yet, so just a peek.&quot; He said, pulling out a third stein. The shape was the same, though the beginnings of the beast carved into the handle bore a striking resemblance to the one munching chestnuts just outside the door. Lines had been drawn on crudely to mark future shavings and detail, and by the shift in his eyes, it nearly embarrassed him to share it in such an unfinished state.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Childhood paintings and toys, a child-sized shield that had both Nils and Cha Cha&#39;s hand prints in paint, a baby blanket embroidered in blue, and then some of his things from his teenage and later years, including a bone flute, a hand drum, and some trinkets of carved wood and bone, hair beads, and such. And there, the prize, a handful of carvings of a phallic nature wrapped up in an old dish cloth embroidered with little flowers.

There was a shout of triumph as the bedroom window creaked open, and Nils hefted himself up over the ledge. &quot;Stop right there, thief!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“… The north is more <em>superstitious</em> than you may realize,” she replied evenly after a moment. 

“But you need not worry yourself. We are well. I have simply found that it is good practice to not invite unnecessary conflict by disclosing inconsequential details.

Head spinning to face him, he grinned wide in challenge. &quot;Oh yeah? Ya can&#39;t stop me... I&#39;ve got a new shield.&quot;

His free hand whipped out from the chest, fingers curled around the handle of that child-sized shield to brandish it defensively in front of him, even as his other hand clutched the goods close to his chest.

When Cha Cha let out his whoop and bolted for the exit, Nils scrambled after him, grabbing for something from the chest to use as a weapon to pursue with - wait, not that. He skidded, stumbled, and turned to gently put his tattered and stuffed bear back into the chest, grabbing instead a little wooden hammer drum, the head of the hammer being a hollow wooden cylinder with leather wrapped over the ends.

Despite her disposition, and the way her emotions were always so muted--making them rather difficult to scrutinize--Nils knew her. He knew her like the back of his hand (with the runes there to prove it). And he was fluent in the tiny microexpressions of his wife, familiar with the little, subtle ways she <em>did</em> show emotion. And the way the side of her body pressed snugly--not firmly, but snugly--against the side of his was something he alone would recognize as a very quiet tell of insecurity.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Then to Niamh, he grinned. &quot;It was kind of a... hmm. A breaking point, I guess?

Holbrook&#39;s a tough place to try to survive in a settled location, much less out on the road, so we were pretty frequently squeezed into small shelters and cuddled up for warmth.

Cha Cha was not usually one for sweets, he was more of a &#39;meat and potatoes&#39; kinda guy, save for a few notable exceptions. A few cakes had made their way onto that list, and so Niamh&#39;s desire to come bake did not go without notice. He had resolved himself to be there for it, whether or not his presence was there to assist in the baking, or at the very least, to be there for the eating.

it&#39;s not like he needed an excuse to be over visiting family anyways, as the winter months often saw him over looking for some project or other he could work on to pass the time, or conversation to be had lest he go stir crazy in his room at the guild hall. A man in the habit of traveling, he liked the walk over just as much as the company.

Though his large fingers found a harder time of it, he offered to help with the darning while he waited, wanting to keep the skill sharp should he need it later. He sat hunched on the couch, elbows propped on his knees to raise the sewing close to his face. His hair had been pulled back out of his face again in a ponytail with a small braid in it, no doubt Nils&#39;s handiwork.</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=loved><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=loved src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/700872440787501147.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

Her satchel once more slung over her shoulders, this time it clattered against her hip as the various fruits and spices she&#39;d scrambled to find for today rattled around inside it, knocking against the bottles of rum and brandy tucked away to one side. The path to the vikings&#39; homes had started to become familiar enough that her feet were carrying her there from memory, leaving her free to flip through the well-worn notebook she&#39;d been using for years to reconstruct recipes for her favorite childhood treats - which she did until closing in on the door of the home. Tucking the book into one of the measly crevices of space left in her bag, she slowed her pace only to surreptitiously examine her reflection in one of the windows as she passed by them. She&#39;d never been able to calm the wispy hairs that framed her face and peeked out over her ears, and despite her efforts today in pulling the entirety of her hair back into a full braid to work, today was no exception. She settled instead for a half-assed attempt to curl them around a finger instead, that they might look intentional. Maybe? No matter. Her knuckles rapped lightly against the door in a monotone sing-song beat.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He carefully rose from the couch to disturb Margret&#39;s seat as little as possible, then scooted over the door. He opened it a little at first with a squint, then wide once he saw it was Niamh. &quot;Hey Niamh, come on in.&quot;

&quot;I wasnt sure how much of the traditionally southern bites you might have on hand, so I brought what I could find.&quot; She puffed up a little as she explained, the eagerness evident on her face. She paused for a moment and glanced back up at Cha Cha, eyes brightening.

He barely had time to take a step further into the house as Niamh passed off the bag to him. In a single motion, he&#39;d shut the door and become a coatrack of sorts. He blinked, then let out a snort, shaking his head.

With a curse he scooted back over to the counter, reaching up to snag Niamh&#39;s bag and wield it like a shield, straps fisted in a hand and the bag held before him for some measure of protection.

Cassiana’s voice was its usual soft, calm self, and amidst the chaos, she had entered the home and limped her way into the kitchen more or less unnoticed. With her staff leveraged in her good hand, a little jar was held aloft in the less corporeal, smoky hand, which she gave an idle look-over, before glancing up expectantly towards Margret. 

“I had been putting some together for our supply, and it occurred to me yours may be running low as well. Good afternoon Cha Cha, Niamh,” she added politely. 

It was all spoken as evenly and peacefully as if she had walked in on them having a well-mannered tea time. Then again, nothing ever really did seem to ruffle the woman.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His incoherent laughs of protest ground to a halt as he heard Cass, head whipping towards her voice like a kid whose hand was caught in the cookie jar - though they clearly hadn&#39;t gotten that far yet. He wiped some of the hazelnut butter from his eyes and licked some from his lips so he could at least see her, and cleared his throat to try and chase away some of the giggles. &quot;H-hey, Cass.
