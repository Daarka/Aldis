Granted, many—if not most—walked about without their halos for one reason or another, but for at least one individual, that was decidedly not the case. In fact, never seen without hers at all, a young woman had wandered into the Creeping Root Inn for the first time in a long time. 

She was certainly memorable in appearance; very conventionally pretty, but in an almost regal sort of way that reminiscent of the paintings of ancient legends. Her complexion was fair and lightly sun-kissed, yet had the faintest undertone of a more olive hue that resulted in a rather ivory color overall. Complimenting that complexion was a full head of—well, not hair, but beautiful leaves. They looked like olive leaves grown from delicate vines that moved and shifted as naturally as hair, but seemed made entirely of foliage instead. Notably, those leaves also grew to form a subtle sort of circlet around the crown of her head. And amidst the leaves, the occasional little flower or bud could be seen, though their presence seemed a bit subdued in comparison.

She wore an off-white dress that went about to her knees, with gladiator sandals running up her shins to meet its hem. The top of the dress only looped over one of her shoulders, leaving the other bare—and the bare shoulder made no attempt to hide the curious, numerous, and very uniform scars running all in the same direction from the back of her shoulder blade to  almost the ridge of her collarbone in the front. Her opposite hand was fitted with an elegantly simple bracer at the wrist that a knowing eye would identify as the equipment of an archer, but there was no accompanying bow or quiver in sight.

Her head seemed gently backlit, regardless of the viewer’s angle, in a subtle golden glow--though more pronounced was the (still soft) glow of a shape like a crescent moon on its side, positioned above her forehead like a crown jewel--and she moved with an appropriately matching grace as she headed towards the bar, heaving a tired but contented sigh as she settled in with a clear eagerness for some sort of food or drink.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

When the young woman entered the building and sat at the bar, he had already long made himself a comfortable fixture of the evening. One bottle of cheap booze had been drained, with a second emptying neatly into his glass.

He was wearing <s>Cain’s</s> his tight black shirt under a loose burgundy button up that’d been left wide open save for where it tucked into the orange-patterned scarves and belts looped around his waist. He also sported fresh pants in a light tan that showed off his legs nicely, especially when tucked into his well-worn boots. In light of the upcoming boat ride, Yarrow had finally splurged on a wardrobe expansion that included some more cold-weather oriented gear for the trip out and back. His hair was pulled back into a fresh braid, likely the work of Niamh and Cain, and for once he almost looked respectable. The jingle of necklaces and collection of rings and earrings were sure to prevent anyone from getting any bright ideas about any respectability the man actually had. The lazy gaze and grin he wore didn’t help either.

He looked up and over as the woman settled into the bar, at first taken in just by the pretty face and figure until little details stuck out more and more. It was hard for him to miss her dress and sandals once he’d registered them, finding the style familiar in a distant way. The leaves of her hair were next, brows raised in surprise - someone else with foliage? Perhaps there was some prickle of envy at how put-together and purposeful her naturalist appearance was compared to his unruly brambles, but it was mostly drowned by a simple want to keep looking. His grin grew, and he slid himself and his drinks a chair or two over to sit beside her. “Hey, soul sister. You look like you could use a drink.” He purred with a grin, raising his glass slightly in comradery.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It might have been the look of heartfelt recognition, but there was no question she and Yarrow were strangers; instead, it was just the look of someone who... probably clocked something similar in Yarrow that he had seen in her.

&quot;--Oh my <em>gosh</em>, I <em>love</em> your hair! Is that natural? Or are they decoration?&quot; To her credit, she didn&#39;t succumb to the immediate bad manner impulse of reaching out to grab his hair and the vines it carried--but her eyes certainly were putting their little incorporeal paws all over the thorns in excitement.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Also she was pretty, that always helped. He nodded and gave one bramble a little wiggle; his brambles were looking much healthier nowadays, with a slightly richer color and less dried out texture. <em>&quot;Au naturel,</em> babe. You can touch it if you want, but I gotta warn you, they <em>are</em> sharp.&quot;

He gestured to her lazily, letting the bramble drop. Despite being fairly certain he knew the answer, he returned the question anyways. &quot;What about you? Are those <em>olive</em> leaves? They&#39;re very charming.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
<div class=chatlog__message-group><div id=chatlog__message-container-1182836153649479711 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1182836153649479711><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><img class=chatlog__avatar src="/icons/Daarka.png" alt=Avatar loading=lazy></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__header><span class=chatlog__author style=color:rgb(192,106,155) title=daarka data-user-id=164583493953650688>Daarka</span> <span class=chatlog__timestamp title="Friday, December 8, 2023 5:08 PM"><a href=#chatlog__message-container-1182836153649479711>12/8/2023 5:08 PM</a></span></div><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;You don&#39;t mind?&quot; She asked, even as she delicately reached forward. Not to grab or pull or even lift the brambles, but simply to run her fingertip across them, weaving between the thorns with an almost childlike giddiness. Real indeed. 

Her eyes practically sparkled as he guessed at her own features--and her eyes themselves were subtly quirky in their own way. Milky soft and pale--though not clouded as if with blindness--but with slivers of gold in surprisingly crisp crescent shapes, with those gold crescents both on the left side of each eye, instead of being mirrored symmetrically.

&quot;Oh, thank you! A keen eye for plants, then? Maybe I shouldn&#39;t be so surprised.&quot; Her acceptance of the compliment was earnest, but not particularly bashful; then again, with her presentation, she probably was no stranger to compliments on her appearance, so it was taken in stride effortlessly. Even as she glowed (metaphorically speaking, though the halo still glimmered away) with the friendly attentions, some of those more humble flower buds buried in the nest of olive leaves gently began to blossom, petals spreading into pleasant little white flowers decorating that crown of leaves around her head. What had resembled regal laurels became more akin to a flower crown in a matter of seconds. It was whimsical to an almost nauseating degree.

&quot;Oh!! Oh, yours <em>move!</em>&quot; She exclaimed as she noticed the brambles curling on their own. &quot;Oh that is so <em>fun</em>.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Then again, his rackish charm was something he delighted in, and even in his better days he was never quite as &#39;pretty&#39; as she was. But those were thoughts for another time (or maybe never, if he didn&#39;t think about it too hard) and he instead gave her a cheeky grin as she accepted the compliment.

As she pointed out the bramble&#39;s idle movement, he let out another little laugh, twirling one around a finger before pulling his finger free to watch it slowly uncurl on its own time in an organic living way. &quot;You think so? They have a bit of a mind of their own... as does yours, evidently.&quot;

Those budding flowers earned a raise of his brows, and while she had been more reserved about her tangible curiosity, he reached out to brush his fingers along the newly-budded flower crown. It was sickeningly perfect, and it suited her well. &quot;You&#39;ve practically got your heart on your sleeve with these babies. They&#39;re gorgeous, though that&#39;s no surprise.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I&#39;m Laurel. I&#39;d introduce my usual friend here, too, but I have no idea where he went. I think he&#39;s been missing rooting around in people&#39;s garbage cans, so he&#39;s probably in some alley doing that.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not that he had that problem, thankfully free of any flowers in his hair. Perhaps there <em>were</em> some benefits to being a bramblefuck after all.

He smoothly took her hand to give it an easy shake, brows raising slowly again as she described her friend, the mental image of a whole ass grown man digging around in a trash can like an oversized raccoon unwittingly flinging itself to the forefront of his imagination. &quot;I&#39;m Yarrow, it&#39;s an absolute pleasure Laurel.

You live such a vastly different life than I do.&quot; He marveled quietly for a moment before clearing his throat.

Quirking a brow, he attempted to salvage some of his cool carefree airs from before she&#39;d taken his brain and whipped it through the bushes. &quot;How exactly did you meet him? What kind of deer gets incarcerated?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

White stags are sacred back home in Acagota, and he was gifted to me as a fawn by a local temple. He liked sticking his nose into whatever I was eating when he was a baby; he wouldn&#39;t try to eat it himself, usually he&#39;d just sneeze into it. Now he&#39;s all grown up and eats garbage. He got put in jail one time because he was doing that, and when a resident tried to shoo him off, he tried to spar with him and the guy thought he was trying to kill him. But I keep my stuff on him so people know he&#39;s not just some wild animal, and so far no one&#39;s tried to shoot him or anything. I thought going to jail would scare him straight a little, but I&#39;m not sure he really understood the whole affair beyond just having a handful of grown men full-body tackle him and put him in a cage until I figured out where he was.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That&#39;s.. Why didn&#39;t I see any of that when <em>I</em> was in Acagota?&quot;

He raised his drink for a sip finally before settling against the bar again. &quot;It&#39;s been a while since I visited, actually. I&#39;m from south of Theros, personally.

She waved a hand in an ambiguous gesture. &quot;I&#39;m a scout for the guild! I travel a lot, but end up back here sooner or later. I also work with the Claret Orders, so I&#39;m kept pretty busy out in the world. Just been away a bit longer than usual this time, but there was this gross-annoying outbreak of undead in the mountains near Balgrove that took <em>foreverrrr</em> to clear up. I know the area well enough that they sent me up there. The forests are super pretty over that way.

The mention of the coast earned a little squint of his eyes, his smile finding some sort of irony in it. &quot;Oh yeah, the coast is to die for.&quot; He mused.

He turned his mind away from that train of thought as she explained her role with some genuine surprise. Then again, the only other scout he knew for the guild was someone he didn&#39;t remember seeing for a while either. Considering their roles, he wasn&#39;t too surprised he&#39;d hardly seen Daarka, let alone having never met Laurel before. And if she was also working for the Claret Orders - not that he cared enough to remember much about them other than they Do Good or something - it was even less surprising. Still, the mental image of her going out to kill a bunch of zombies was a surprise. He knew better than to judge a pretty face as incompetent though.

&quot;You know, I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever had to deal with a spectral pest infestation. Or a zombie one, for that matter.&quot; He said, raising his glass for another sip. After a moment, he piped back up as his brain helpfully reminded him of his somewhat-similar experience. &quot;I <em>did</em> help kill a bunch of ashy cursed suits of armor and whatever the hell the Duke turned into over in Ghalasine a while back though. That was kinda fun, honestly.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

You&#39;re not even really killing creatures, at the end of the day, you&#39;re just kind of putting the natural order back into place. I don&#39;t know about ash-things, but undead are kind of disgusting, too, so that makes it pretty clear-cut. At least the ones with flesh. Because it&#39;s all typically rotting.

(though frankly, he was fairly content to remain firmly squatted in the &#39;whatever pays the bills&#39; category. Wanting to do good was fun and all until you were plotting a course to a wandering island for a month. He&#39;d put in for his good deed, and once this was done he was cashing out.)

&quot;Has he really?&quot; He gave her a wide grin, still maintaining that general fascination. &quot;I mean... a baby bird&#39;s fresh. I guess even sacred trash gremlins know better than to eat rotting meat. I didn&#39;t even know they <em>could</em> eat meat. Shows what I know about deer.&quot;

He raised his cup to his lips, eyes glinting almost playfully over the rim. &quot;I bet fighting zombies is awful for keeping clean, what with all their.. rot and filth. You ever just come home and immediately hop into the bath for a good long soak?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I&#39;m starting to wonder if <em>nothing</em> eats <em>only</em> plants.&quot; She paused, tipping her head thoughtfully. &quot;On that note, same goes the other way around. Carnivores rarely tend to be above nibbling a berry or chewing on some grass if the moment calls for it. Nothing in nature works in absolutes.&quot;

She looked back to Yarrow at his question, nodding immediately. &quot;Every single time, yes. And whenever I&#39;m back home, I stock up on soaps because nowhere else does bath products like Siscians, I swear. I think it&#39;s all the locally-mastered oils that do it.

At the mention of soaps, another tinge of that distant longing shifted in the brambles inside him. It&#39;d been so long, how could he have forgotten? He let out a groan, nodding. &quot;Not to mention the olive oil. The stuff down here&#39;s <em>okay,</em> but it&#39;s not the same. Gods. I haven&#39;t. I&#39;ve been away from Siscia so long I forgot about the fucking soaps.&quot; He had been intending to flirt but had so thoroughly been derailed by the conversation that the streak of homesickness he had never really thought of was rearing its ugly little head, but not in a way that he could really linger on it, too distracted by fucking soap.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She perked up at his new question, relaxing slightly as they steered back into less scary territory. &quot;Artemis, the Matron of the Hunt Herself. Though <em>mommy</em> makes it sound like there&#39;s a lineage there or something. It&#39;s not, like... biological or whatever. What about yourself?&quot;

There was no ounce of surprise in the implication that Yarrow, too, was of celestial blood. Yarrow, perhaps, had found at least one singular person who didn&#39;t have to ask.

&quot;Wait--Wait, no, let me guess. Wait. I forgot we&#39;re both from Siscia. I can guess. Hang on.&quot; She pivoted to face him more directly, squinting at him thoughtfully. &quot;I&#39;m <em>sure</em> we would have met already if you had ties to Artemis as well. So--hm.

Woe be he to interrupt her attempts... and honestly, a part of him <em>really</em> wanted to see if she could manage to guess correctly.

Her eyes widened, head tilting slightly in rapt intrigue. &quot;Wait--Are you, like... If you have His lineage, how does that work? Are you, like... an extension of His role in that whole dynamic? Or are you the hunter? Oh my god--are you a hunter?!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He&#39;d heard similar stories about the dynamic between hunters and boar in the forest, but to hear it described as special was a context he&#39;d never really considered. Not in recent years, anyways, not with how long he&#39;d spent resenting Ozzy&#39;s presence in his life.

He gave a little surprised laugh at the questions, so familiar and yet so unlike the usual questions he got regarding his lineage. &quot;I don&#39;t.. think I&#39;m the hunter, no. I&#39;m a fencer, really. Was. I <em>can</em> use a bow, I just prefer to get up and personal.&quot;

He took another drink from his glass and drained it, letting the alcohol ease his attempt to describe his connection. While before he&#39;d never had any desires to sugarcoat his relationship with Ozymanthios, her prior knowledge and enthusiasm gave him just enough pause. &quot;I honestly have never really had a good relationship with him growing up. Your dreams from Artemis seem nice, but with Ozzy, it was more of him just... tromping around like he owned the place.

He settled back in against the bar as she described her relationship with Artemis. Once again that little pang of envy pinged in the back of his mind. Every other Aasimar had such a good relationship with their respective deities, whether directly blood related or literally Chosen for Her purpose. Sure, Ozzy had declared him His plenty of times, but it&#39;d always felt more of a demand than a call to service. &quot;Sounds like you&#39;ve got your life made then, huh? Artemis really seems to be looking out for ya. Sounds like the only thing she hasn&#39;t helped you out with is finding a girlfriend at this rate.&quot;

Oh yeah, he&#39;d swung the conversation back. He gave her an innocent grin.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She reached to accept the wine handed over by the barkeep with a light word of thanks, giving it a little sniff of appreciation. &quot;... It <em>is</em> Dionysus, isn&#39;t it. Oh my god you lied to my face. Look at you, drinking wine like a liar.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The accusation that he was Dionysus&#39;s descendent earned another laugh, and he grinned even as he shook his head. <em>&quot;Gods,</em> no, I fucking wish it was Dionysus. Maybe then I&#39;d have had grape vines in my hair instead or something. I just really like alcohol. Look-&quot;

Leaning in a little, he curled a lip to show off one of his lower canines, jutting a bit larger and sharper than the rest of his otherwise normal teeth. &quot;I sincerely doubt Dionysus or Eros would pack these bad boys in here.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I think having grapes for hair would suck. Do you know how many people, like, just grab at my flowers? Not just to touch them, but like trying to <em>pluck</em> them? Which, by the way, hello, makes me <em>bleed</em>, it&#39;s not like I tell anyone they have my <em>consent</em> to do that.

He certainly wasn&#39;t doing much to disprove the relation.

He nodded knowingly as she described how grabby some people could be, though he thought back to his own experiences with roaming hands. Usually he welcomed them though. &quot;gods, I can only imagine. Usually people don&#39;t grab my brambles since they&#39;re sharp.. I can only imagine how much more inviting yours are with how soft and pretty the petals are.&quot;

Even he&#39;d reached out earlier for a touch, even if he&#39;d known better than to <em>grab and pull.</em> He gave her a cheeky smile. &quot;Okay, look. I know I&#39;m not defeating the Dionysus allegations here, but listen. I grew up at a vineyard, okay? If I had grapes in my hair, I&#39;d probably have been the first to try to pluck them, whether to eat or see if I couldn&#39;t make wine from them. I mean, I&#39;ve tried shaving off some of my thorns before. For.. various reasons.&quot;

He paused to roll up a sleeve to show off the trails of thorns running up his forearm. &quot;I&#39;d take grapes any day over getting these caught in all my clothes growing up. They&#39;re on my collarbones, legs, and back too.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And every time I managed to stab the hell out of myself with them being there. I’d probably try to cut them off, too, if I was always prickly. I’m too clumsy, I’d always be gouging holes in myself. With myself. It’d be a hazard.”

She leaned over to better look as he showed off his throned arms to her. “<em>Ooh</em>. Those look really nice, though! Like… they’re in pretty patterns and little neat lines and stuff. That’s so much better than if they were, like… just random spikes all over the place. What a nightmare. This actually looks really good on you!

He also wasn’t surprised as she described getting stabbed by them every time they grew, nodding with a sympathetic and knowing grin. “You do get used to it after a while, but I <em>definitely</em> gouged myself more than once growing up until I got there. I’m just glad I didn’t have them as a baby, can you imagine how much a prickly little menace I could’ve been as a two year old?”

He preened a little as she complimented the thorns. Even if they weren’t <em>his</em> favorite, a compliment was a compliment, and even he could admit they’d had their uses over the years. “Awww, thanks babe! They don’t really spike out like that or anything, it would be pretty cool if they did. They do… <em>kinda</em> react to my mental state, I guess? Not quite to the extent your hair does though.”

“And, if things go reaaally south on a mission, I <em>can</em> just kinda-“ He spread his hands almost dramatically, fingers curled in little claws with a <em>poof</em> sound while the bramble in his hair curled a little as well. “- turn into a big mass of brambles like some kind of freaky sentient bush. I’d show you, but it’s not exactly a fun bar trick.”

A pause, then he jerked a thumb over the bar with a grin. “Oh, but I <em>can</em> snag bottles off the back shelf with my vines. Wanna see?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He eyed the bar a moment, scanning the shelves before he settled on a cheaper liquor. He had nowhere to be right now, which meant he could take his time drinking. Extending a hand, he made a gesture almost like a grasp with a quick twist of the wrist. On command, the vines making up his forearm shifted to release one in a quick snap, the brambled end curling around the neck of the bottle in the blink of an eye before yanking it off the shelf as it retreated back into the recesses of Yarrow&#39;s anatomy. With a practiced glint in his eye, he snatched the bottle once it was in reach, turning back to Laurel and giving it a victory wiggle. &quot;Tada.~&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
