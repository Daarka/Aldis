In those days, neither Yarrow nor Achoris had seen any trace of the runechild. Kelnari, however, had kept to his word--loosely--in that he would stay in town. In truth, he stayed just outside of it, well accustomed (despite his manicured appearance) to sleeping in the forest. It wasn&#39;t ideal, but... he didn&#39;t like taking risks. Least of all when he had only just arrived in town. He usually managed to get at <em>least</em> a couple good years out of a town before no longer being comfortable lingering. 

Maybe that was a stubborn streak. More likely, he was just tired. He wanted to have not ruined this destination so quickly. But that depended entirely on what Yarrow and Achoris wanted to do with the knowledge they now had, minimal though it was. Kelnari knew better than to think minimal information was only <em>minimally</em> problematic; people feared the unknown, and their imaginations would fill in the blanks with far worse horrors than the truth could ever be. Mysteries left room for exaggeration, for fiction, for embellishments. 

They both seemed... unnaturally accepting of everything. He was still grappling with that. But more than that, he was waiting for the catch to make itself known. <em>We&#39;re not the good guys</em>, he had said, describing why he was not disturbed when he should have been. But while that may have bode well for setting Yarrow&#39;s tolerance to an agreeable level, Kelnari wasn&#39;t comfortable with other implications. A little bit too much knowledge, with only a little effort in its presentation, was a loaded weapon that not one, but <em>two</em> men now just carried around town. 

Maybe they&#39;d never pull the trigger. Maybe there was some sort of... honor amongst thieves, in that regard. But maybe they weren&#39;t the type for that. Maybe they still felt slighted, and their pettiness picked up that weapon. Maybe they simply found a way to capitalize on that information, to profit from it at his expense, sell it to the highest bidder. Maybe--

Kelnari had been walking aimlessly through the woods, barely even looking where he was going. He wasn&#39;t seeking a destination; he was just wandering, trying to think. Mumbling under his breath to himself all the way, half of his inner dialogue spoke aloud (albeit quietly). But he stopped dead in his tracks, freezing perfectly still as something clawed at his senses.

He stood, motionless, for a long moment. Then he drew in a deep breath, closing his eyes as if to center himself, or settle his nerves. When he opened them again, the look of muted surprise was replaced with something much emptier, and he changed direction, moving a bit more slowly forward. 

It was so strong. He never encountered it so strong just out in the wilderness. Maybe someone was dying. But his pace was cautious and steady--so if someone <em>was</em> dying, he likely would not be preventing that.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1159391590536716308 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1159391590536716308><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, October 5, 2023 12:28 AM">12:28 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>It only took a couple minutes before it was nearly overpowering, though his demeanor remained rather casual. All at once, he had practically stumbled across an unexpected little structure, tucked well out of sight in the trees. No beaten path surrounding it, but undeniably manmade. A little... smoke shed?

Kelnari squinted at the sight. Hesitated, before slowly circling around it until he found where the structure had an open face, leading into a little three-walled sort of room. And for a split second, everything in that little scene registered in Kelnari&#39;s eyes only as the color scarlet.

He blinked once. Shades of scarlet. A table... hanging butcher&#39;s tools... an immense quantity of meat. All very fresh; the flies weren&#39;t even on it yet. He almost resolved to move along, but... something about it quirked at his vision. Something was a little uncanny to the sight, and he didn&#39;t immediately know why.

So he stepped forward. Brazenly, some may say, trespassing into what was clearly someone&#39;s property. Stupidly, others would more accurately say. It wasn&#39;t until he was standing well inside the structure, close enough to pick up a knife and get to work himself, when a bin beside the table caught his eye. Random bits of offal were piled in it, clearly the butcher&#39;s trash bin of sorts. Kelnari was only really struck by the sight of a human head there amongst the gore, though.

He stood still for several long moments, processing that. He glanced back to the main table, and what had at first just looked to be some nondescript mound of meat, he could now recognize the traces of human anatomy within. His gaze shifted back to the bin. He glimpsed fingers as well... this was an entire, full, adult, humanoid body. All of this meat came from a person.

His expression remained... concerningly empty. Whether it was brazenness or stupidity, it finally stirred him to move--not to exit the premises, like any thoughtful person would, but to unhurriedly stoop forward, towards that bin of discarded bits. Reaching in without a care in the world for the mess he quickly stained his hands with, grasping that head--its eyes gouged out, the top of its skull missing--and pulling it out. He stood back up straight again, grasping it almost gently so that it was positioned to &quot;look&quot; at him, as if he didn&#39;t have all the information he should have needed just from a quick glance around whatever this place was.

His expression was... unreadable. Still empty. His breaths were not quickened; they actually were very rhythmic and--very nearly meditative. He passively studied the disembodied head, the things that had been carved out of it. The practiced way they had been carved out of it. 

What a strange thing to leave lying around in the woods.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

To cut and baste strips that would be smoked for jerky, others marinated for more immediate consumption, and the rest frozen for future use. To render a humanoid body into meat indistinguishable from any animal carcass, the more identifiable parts discarded in a manner that would make it very difficult for someone to stumble across.

And so he didn&#39;t anticipate anyone finding his little slaughterhouse during a time he was actively using it, and thought nothing of filling a couple buckets of water from the nearby stream and leaving his business unattended for twenty minutes. So when he returned to find a... very familiar person so casually holding the head of the victim he&#39;d claimed, he just stood there a moment, the only thought in his head being, <em>&#39;Well. Shit.&#39;</em>

Heaving a sharp sigh, he set down the buckets of water and summoned his was scepter to his hands. &quot;What are you doing here, Kel?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But there was no fear as recognition set in. &quot;Oh. It&#39;s you.&quot; He paused, before looking back down at the head.

&quot;I was wandering the woods. The smell of...&quot; he tipped his head in a vague gesture towards the half-butchered gore, &quot;<em>this</em> seemed out of place. Suppose curiosity got the better of me.&quot;

It was spoken with the calm passiveness of someone who had stumbled across Achoris&#39; pillow fort in the woods, not a butchered human man. 

&quot;... Soooo...&quot; He looked back up at the aasimar, a faint squint of his eyes interrupting his otherwise <em>nothingness</em> of an expression. &quot;Are you a psychopath?

His mouth opened slighlty. Then closed. A moment passed. It opened again. 

&quot;... You mentioned a niece... does your family... <em>know</em> this? Does your family know you eat people?&quot;

Despite how one would expect the words to be spoken, they did not come with any of the expected emotions. He wasn&#39;t appalled. He wasn&#39;t scolding Achoris. He didn&#39;t even seem focused on the horror of the subject matter itself.

Shock that had been nonexistent regarding the gory discovery in front of him seemed to surface only at the admission that Achoris... well. Had family who were aware of his diet? 

The seemingly mundane detail struck him dumb. His gaze wandered off of the aasimar, staring off at nothing on the ground for a long moment. 

Then he started giggling. Stunned, breathy giggles at first. But as his gaze wandered to his surroundings--the <em>people meat</em> just hanging on hooks like in a proper butcher&#39;s shop--that laughter seemed to double over itself. He kept trying to say something, as if to elaborate on what was so funny, but every time, the attempt at a word just had him wheezing in even more intense laughter, until he was bent over, tears in his eyes, absolutely <em>cackling</em> and shaking at the world&#39;s funniest joke that had been told to him and him alone.

It wasn&#39;t laughter Achoris had seen from him before. The night they had previously spent together, Kel&#39;s mirth had been dainty and scandalized. Achoris wouldn&#39;t have realized until now, seeing the alternative, that Kel had previously done a very good job of muting his amusement, covering his mouth when he laughed. Not now. Now, Kel made no effort at all--didn&#39;t even appear to have the capacity to--to skillfully disguise the prominently sharp fangs that were bared plainly as he was lost in the throes of some unknown comedy, his mouth open in an involuntarily massive grin and gasps for merciful breath. 

Tears were streaking down his face, but through the blur of them, he could still see the scarlet all around him. He could feel the head he was holding. He could smell the iron and offal all around. It just made him laugh harder.

It gradually became apparent he was trying to say something. A single syllable, that--with immense effort--he forced out between breathy wheezes. 

&quot;--<em>Don&#39;t</em>.&quot;

There was barely any true volume to the word, but instantaneously, the rune on his forehead illuminated the same pretty glow he had demonstrated at the tavern.

Slowly, he fought to regain his composure, though it was an uphill battle. Every couple of seconds came another wheeze of, &quot;<em>Don&#39;t,</em>&quot; and the glow of that rune got sharper and sharper with each utterance. 

Until whatever force that glow represented became multiplied enough that it seemed to actually break his flesh, and a bead of blood welled up and streaked down the center of his face, cascading off the side of his nose.

Still shaking with laughter--or whatever it was he was experiencing--he stiffly set the head down on the nearest surface, unhurriedly making his way back out of the shed and wandering a few steps towards the trees. He slouched against the first one he reached, gasping breaths working to settle his debilitating case of giggles, tears and now also blood dripping casually from his face. 

As the cackling gradually subsided, he finally reached a point where there was no more laughter left. In its absence, he stared off into space, suddenly looking... so <em>unspeakably</em> tired. There was silence again.

And then he punched the tree he had been leaning against. Hard enough that a spray of splintered wood erupted from the side of the trunk, leaving it looking like it had been struck by a small cannonball of sorts. 

Kel&#39;s face had twisted into something pained, but with another muttering of, &quot;<em>Don&#39;t...</em>&quot;, he slowly oozed back down onto the ground, ultimately flopping onto his back to stare up at the sky.

When he finally spoke again, it did seem to be directed at Achoris. &quot;... That sounds nice.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was silent for several long moments following Kel&#39;s final statement, and when he did speak, it started with a <em>&#39;tsk</em> of his tongue detaching from behind his front teeth and a deep breath.

&quot;Like I&#39;m the dumbass for not thinking of that sooner. I&#39;m not--I&#39;m happy for you. I am,&quot; he emphasized, hands flopping down again. &quot;It... sounds nice. It must be nice.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;... Things going wrong.&quot;

A beat. &quot;... Not flesh, no. So not a cannibal, I guess.&quot; He was quiet a moment, chewing things over. Or more accurately, being battered between the urges of deeply ingrained trauma and staggeringly consuming loneliness at odds with one another.

The loneliness ultimately won out.

&quot;It was blood at first. That just... wasn&#39;t very sustainable, leaving dead people everywhere I went. Draws a lot of attention.

He chewed his bottom lip a little, once again muted from his instinct to not let the words loose. Eventually, he worked through it.

&quot;... Before... <em>that</em> affliction... I always had a thing with... dreams, I guess, to put it... extremely vaguely. It&#39;s... It gets... really complicated. But the point is, I found a path through that instead. Found a way to eat dreams. No one had to die anymore. I could stay in one place longer. So that&#39;s been... that&#39;s been what it is. For a very long time.&quot; He slowly rubbed at the back of his neck.

&quot;But it can&#39;t just be butterflies and rainbows. The act still looks horrifying to literally everyone who sees it, no matter how hard I try to avoid that. I should have been more careful.

Even when I forced myself to eat it, it just tasted ashen and unappealing. One day I was out walking the streets and came upon the body of a man who had just been murdered in a back alley. Some instinct drew me to the body, some primal need. My mouth watered at the sight of it, and I had the strongest compulsion to bite into him... And it was the best thing I&#39;d ever tasted. Warmth and sunshine and utterly divine. And I felt sated for the first time in my memory. And I knew - that&#39;s what was missing from my diet, what I needed to thrive. Of course, I had to hide it and the things I did to acquire it, and it wasn&#39;t long after that I was banished for entirely unrelated reasons. But it&#39;s how I was made to be, and so I feel no reason to be squeamish or guilty about it.&quot;

&quot;... Times... when... I had... access. Nightly. And... drinking nightly was great. But I could go every other night and be just as happy. Once every three days, sometimes.&quot;

He fell silent a moment. Then gave a short, humorless huff of a laugh. &quot;I said &#39;smelled&#39;. I... I think I&#39;ve always just used that word in my own head. But it&#39;s not a smell.

&quot;... It&#39;s... Ah. I never know how to describe it. I guess... it&#39;s like we&#39;re conjoined twins. So much of who I am has been merged between... whoever Kel would have been on his own, and whoever Nari would have been on her own. I... I feel all of her emotions. Sometimes I can&#39;t even tell whose are whose anymore.&quot;

His gaze fell back to wandering the space around him again, something distant and disconnected in his demeanor. Maybe subconsciously putting distance between himself and the situation, anticipating it to bite him sooner or later.

&quot;... Being Kalashtar was never some dark burden to me. Though I left home about as soon as I could fend for myself. I... loved it there, I just... never quite felt in sync with the rest of them. The Quori had all paired themselves with hosts of a like gender, but I was a fetus in my mother&#39;s belly at the time. I guess it made things a little less straightforward. My culture is... a good one. Truly. Everything I&#39;ve encountered on the mainland is full of every manner of strife in comparison. But a lot of our society involves pretty heavily gendered roles, and... it just... felt weird. I miss it every day, but... I also couldn&#39;t really envision myself living my life there. I couldn&#39;t see where I would fit into it all. It... would probably be easier if it was just like... what I assume you&#39;re referring to with yourself,&quot; he continued, giving a half-nod towards Achoris. &quot;A presence or a voice or something in your head. Like telepathy. But Nari <em>is</em> me. That... gets really confusing when who we are individually doesn&#39;t line up with one another.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He absently touched the ruby, thumb brushing along the golden was scepter setting. &quot;These things weren&#39;t true of course, but hearing all the priests at my Father&#39;s temple, and my other, human father laying all these accusations on me... Well. Aasimar can be the definition of self-fulfilling prophecies, it seems. I thought myself Fallen from Set&#39;s grace, and so I became Fallen and stopped hearing Him in my dreams.

I&#39;m having to get a bit creative with my remains. I have spotted a couple of missing persons flyers of my victims in other towns I&#39;ve visited, but aside from &#39;humanoid,&#39; there&#39;s no pattern to my kills, and no motive most people would come to.
