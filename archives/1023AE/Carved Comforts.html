Though the sun was rising slower and slower every morning, the limiting daylight only seemed to emphasize how much work was remaining to finish up the last of the harvest. At least the jam was long done, which left fields to be harvested, fences repaired, and even a few hooves trimmed.

He sat alone in his room, bent over the table with his half-eaten dinner set aside to make room for the growing pile of wood chips. In his hands, a bird in flight was beginning to take shape as each freed chip left behind a feather or beak. Though his room  filled with little more than the repeating swipes of his knife, something about the subtle sounds of the building and other rooms beyond had grown comforting, and his mind wandered contentedly.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

This is stupid.&quot;
Niamh had spent the walk over from the tavern with one arm tucked tight around Cain&#39;s waist, and the other cradling Lil Man once he&#39;d rolled himself into his best impression of an orb. Navigating the halls of the guild found her gait slowing almost cautiously as they climbed the stairs, eventually coming to a halt a couple feet back from the familiar door that she&#39;d just spent the last minute staring blankly at.
&quot;He&#39;s probably sleeping,&quot; she grunted, tugging at Cain to backtrack away and towards their own rooms, but just as quickly grumbled as her feet took a u-turn and landed back directly in front of the door, a miserable expression on her face. Looking back to Cain as though she were an anchor, Niamh&#39;s jaw set as she closed the gap to the door, the hand not locked around her companion&#39;s in a vice grip hovering hesitantly in the air.
&quot;He&#39;s probably asleep,&quot; she muttered once more, reassuring herself this time. She granted herself a timid rub of a clammy palm against her bicep before gently rapping against the wood as her voice came out so, so small.
&quot;<em>Cha Cha</em>?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She knew the man less well than Niamh, but their experiences in the mist had been so visceral, so real. It would also hearten Cain to see the burly man in human form, and not as meatloaf (although she would never be so crass as to audibly voice <em>that</em> intrusive thought).

As Niamh&#39;s steps began to lag a bit, Cain&#39;s hand at the other woman&#39;s waist was firm, guiding them on. &quot;If you told him what happened, I think he would be sad if you didn&#39;t stop by. If some horror sent you a vision of me like what we saw, I would want the opportunity to give you a hug.&quot; Out of range of other ears, Cain was rather forthright and candid, offering Niamh the same comfort the two had been trading back and forth this whole hell-sent day.

As the pair reached Cha Cha&#39;s door, Cain was quiet. She thought it would be very very good for Niamh to do this, but wanted to let her make the decision for herself. As Niamh turned to look at her with an absolutely pained expression, Cain gave her another hug, this time wrapping both her arms around her in a tight grip, before returning her hand to Niamh&#39;s to let Niamh knock.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 25, 2023 1:08 PM">(edited)</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=icries><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=icries src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/895744601858670632.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>2</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

He wasn&#39;t expecting company, and his most consistent late night visitor was off in Longwatch. Curious, he set the knife and bird down on the table and stood from his chair which gave a faint wooden squeak. He opened the door to a sliver at first, then quickly opened it the rest of the way as he realised just who was there.

It was Cha Cha. Alive, in the flesh, and whole. Despite his short-sleeved shirt showing off his plentiful scars, none of them cut so deep to make the man look like mincemeat. The only blood red on him was his tattoos, just as it should be.

&quot;Niamh? Cain? What the devil&#39;re ya two doin here, weren&#39;t ya in...?&quot; He marveled with wide blinks. The confusion slowly melted as he took in their almost haggard appearances, worry immediately climbing his hackles and causing him to lean forward with a beckoning hand. &quot;Are ya alright?&quot; He asked, voice soft with concern.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 25, 2023 12:27 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

No scars marring his body but the ones she already knew. Her nails dug into the palm of her free hand, suddenly seized with the memory of the feel of his dark silken hair slick with gore. With his own blood. With Nuala&#39;s and Nils&#39; and Cass&#39; and Margret&#39;s and Stefan&#39;s and Kaskra&#39;s and Meos&#39; and -- she felt bile churning in her stomach, and realized this was the part where people usually said things aloud. Like, &#39;hey we got back early just wanted to make sure you werent for real drawn and quartered&#39; would be a start. Not a good one, but a start. Better than staring up misty-eyed at him and choking on the words in her throat, which was instead how she responded to his soft concern. Instead, she grasped gingerly at his outstretched hand and stared up at his face as the tears finally started spilling over and carved thick tracks along her cheeks, the only vocalization a hoarse, strangled sob that clawed up from her chest.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His throat tightened with worry, gut twisting at all the possibilities - what <em>were</em> the possibilities? What in the world could drive her to look at him with those big beautiful eyes full of loss and horror? He&#39;d thought he&#39;d seen the last of eyes like that. He&#39;d hoped.

Cain&#39;s voice snapped him from his wondering, driving the man into action and accommodation. &quot;-No no, of course, come in, come in. Make yourselves at home.&quot; He immediately shifted in the doorway to make room for their entry, scooting around behind them to shut the door as soon as they were inside, all the while ensuring Niamh&#39;s hand in his never lost that connection. 

The room was a familiar sight to Niamh, just as she would remember it save the slightest shift that came with the presence of a regular occupant. By the door was a coatrack, devoid of anything save Cha Cha&#39;s usual off-white duster while his heavy backpack sat on the floor in front of it. His room was larger than theirs, if only due to the double bedrooms that implied the space was meant for two. One door - the guest room - remained shut, while the door to his own room was cracked. The front area had a simple table with a pair of matching chairs and a third handmade one of wood, a well-worn throw rug on the floor, and a similarly worn couch with blankets and pillows arranged in just a way that told they were used for couch naps more often than not. Similarly handmade shelves lined the walls with collections of shelf-stable goods (more than a few jars of jam still lingering) near the icebox, while others were filled with a few books, journals, and woodworking knickknacks and tools.

He looked them over with a heavy frown, his free hand gently resting on Cain&#39;s shoulder to include her in what comfort he could provide; he could see she&#39;d shed her own fair share of tears earlier. &quot;Why don&#39;t ya two take a seat at the table, aye? I can make hot chocolate, warm up a little dinner. Have ya two eaten any?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

No tang of iron in his scent, no slick moisture in the air, just the smell of shorn wood and flannel and a warm hearth. The awkwardness of the wonky chain she had inadvertently engineered evidently was lost on her, instead opting to curl into him with the hand she&#39;d used to grasp at him now stifling the sounds of her hitched breathing as she fought to regain her poise, eyes shooting an apologetic glance at Cain.

The strength of her grip on Cain&#39;s hand was solid and comforting in its crush, irrefutable proof that Cain was still wanted here. Her own eyes prickled at the warm, comforting weight of Cha Cha&#39;s hand on her shoulder. The consolation so freely given was a surprise, although with how deeply Niamh cared for the man, it probably shouldn&#39;t have been. Cain just wasn&#39;t sure what she&#39;d done to deserve it. She closed her eyes for a few precarious breaths, then opened them, focusing her attention on inspecting the room around her in a desperate bid for control over her emotions. 

She cleared her throat, having made it through the threat that she might cry again herself. The bottle of wine she&#39;d finished on the walk over had certainly helped to numb things. &quot;We&#39;ve ah... had some liquid calories. Food would be lovely, if it isn&#39;t too much of an imposition. The last thing we ate were the snacks Meos packed for us in the lib-&quot;

Even Cain, though he barely knew her, wholly earned his gut&#39;s comfort as what little shell of &#39;put together&#39; she&#39;d been holding nearly shattered. He didn&#39;t need to know her to know the two cared deeply for each other, and that was enough.

He could smell the smoke lingering from the bar, the scent of alcohol weaving in.

She tested her breathing and found that her breaths were ragged, but at least she wasn&#39;t hyperventilating. As the initial rigid panic passed, she slummed slightly, hoping desperately this wouldn&#39;t be ripped away from her as well. 

&quot;That sounds nice.&quot;

When she spoke it was hardly above a whisper, but she managed a creaky smile for them both. 
&quot;Aye, sounds nice.&quot;
She was compliant as Cha Cha initiated the awkward shuffle over to where food was, locked in to both of the emotional tethers on either side of her, and even began absentmindedly plucking up the bits and pieces she knew he&#39;d need to make his go-to snacks. The jar of raspberry jam that had been his pride and joy from this year&#39;s batch, the loaf of perfectly crispy sourdough he&#39;d gotten from the baker that insisted on trading for the jar they&#39;d received - everything familiar and fondly remembered.

It didn&#39;t take long for the sizzle of meat to fill the ambience of the room while he kept one eye on the pan and the other on the pair. In absence of anything better to say, his conversation turned domestic. He spoke about his day, the farm he&#39;d helped. One of the ewes had given birth, and the lamb had proven a wily one once she found her legs. Replacing a fence post had gone well, and didn&#39;t you hear the neighbor&#39;s dog got out again?

Gradually, her shoulders drooped as the tension left her. Though her face remained stained with tear tracks that had dragged the kohl from her eyes along her cheeks, those too began to dry. And before long she found her voice again, offering the occasional supplement to Cha Cha&#39;s story to fill in the blanks for Cain - that ewe had been so fat with those babies that the farmer was worried her stomach would start dragging along the ground, and the neighbor&#39;s dog had them spending an entire afternoon chasing him down just a few weeks ago, no one knew how he was getting out. Before too long she was flashing tiny smiles at Cain whenever she caught her eye, and relished in the tangible sensations that cemented with certainty that they were here. The smell of cooking meat, the heat of the stove before her and of Cha Cha&#39;s body behind her, the lifeline that was Cain&#39;s hand in hers. And the awkward shuffling of the three of them huddled together and attempting to complete the cooking, the realization of which finally put a grin on her face. But she made no move to leave the comfort theyd found, instead perking up at Cain&#39;s offer to help before shuffling slightly to fetch a bottle of milk from the ice box, passing it over with a nod.
&quot;Better hot chocolate this way.&quot;</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=niamhuwu><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=niamhuwu src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1131816722559676537.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

Her curiosity burgeoned about the goings on at the farm. Was the new litter of lambs the usual size? Did Cha Cha have a favorite animal there? How often did Niamh go with him to visit? Quiet, honest conversation, just enough to keep their minds from wandering back to darkness.

The food smelled delicious, and Cain was struck with the value of a home-cooked meal, something she&#39;d so rarely gotten to experience. It was grounding, humbling, and alluringly addicting, the idea that this could be normal life. Something about this thought really shook Cain out of the last vestiges of her fear. Nyx would never know to tempt her with this. Cain hadn&#39;t known she&#39;d wanted it, squeezed Niamh&#39;s hand back gently with her happiness in the moment.

As Niamh handed her the milk, Cain looked at it like she&#39;d never made hot chocolate before in her life (she hadn&#39;t). Still, she intuited that it was to replace the water, and reached around Cha Cha&#39;s burly form to acquire a small pan before struggling to light the hob in front of her.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Eager to keep the good mood growing, he gave Cain an encouraging smile at her offer to help - even if her expression made it perfectly clear this was a new experience. Thankfully good hot cocoa was a staple of his growing up, and he found it easy to guide Cain along for it. &quot;Milk&#39;ll make it really creamy. Ya gotta be mindful with it on the stove though - it likes to boil over quick. We don&#39;t want it to burn, we just want it hot enough to melt the sugar and chocolate. Here, use a spoon, keep it moving. Just like that.&quot;

He stretched to the shelf to grab a dwindling supply of cocoa while the meat seared and grabbed a kitchen knife, slicing slivers of chocolate into the milk pan with the same skill and care he carved wood. While he worked, he gave Niamh a small smile and tried prying out the woman he knew a little more. &quot;Niamh, would ya kindly give the meat a flip please?&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Thursday, October 26, 2023 4:23 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She only paused when a chill ran down her spine as her eye caught sight of the knife in Cha Cha&#39;s hand - wielded with decades of practice and respect for the tool, but still enough to violently pierce her thoughts with the memories and imagery that had plagued her all day. The clean cleaves that had separated shoulder from neck, belly from pelvis. The glassy look in the eyes of the dead. The blood that coated Saoirse&#39;s blade - now hung silently at her hip. 
The faraway look dissolved at Cha Cha&#39;s voice, and she blinked owlishly up at him as the roaring, pounding of her own heartbeat in her ears began to dissipate. Back to the room, back to the smell of searing meat and the sweetness of bubbling milk. Back to the feeling of Lil Man&#39;s teeny claws on her back as he finally stirred, scrambling his way up to poke his head out from between her clothing layers and peer expectantly up at his favorite person shaving up bits of chocolate. Back to the present.
The hitched breath that had caught in her chest released as she tuned back in, reaching up briefly to scratch at the familiar&#39;s exposed chin before flashing Cha Cha half of a grin. &quot;Yeah, of course.&quot;
Turning to Cain, Niamh gave her an apologetic smile as she noted the clamminess of her palms. She felt herself settle back in after a moment - the equilibrium more easily accomplished the second time. She managed another increasingly familiar grin she gave Cain a quick squeeze on the hand again - one, two - before finally, finally letting go. In this case, so that the two of them could actually use both hands when tending to the cooking. Reaching for the two-tined fork she knew would be hung to her left, she set about moving the meat around the skillet, swiping a sneaky pat of butter and adding it to the mix as she lost herself in the task.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Thursday, October 26, 2023 9:37 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Cain generally made herself useful stirring the milk, being the least experienced cook.

Maybe never, if they didn’t want to talk about it, gods knew he might not have were he in their shoes. He was fine with not knowing, if it meant he was helping.

He exhaled an amused huff as Lil Man peeked out, head canting in consideration. “Ach, the beast awakes now that there’s food about, eh? What makes ya think yer gonna get anything? I don’t see ya helping cook.”

He let his words linger with his faux judgement, even as his hands sliced a thin little curl of chocolate. “Mmm, alright, y’can have-“

Abruptly he cursed, looking back to his hand. The block of cocoa had begun to get quite small in his large hands and he’d foolishly been watching Lil Man instead of what he was doing. The cut to his palm wasn’t deep, but it was enough to draw blood, right on the chocolate. He tsk’d in disappointment, raising it up to examine. “Damn idjit.” He muttered, chastising himself.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Running one of the tines of the fork over the surface to gauge the sear and temperature, she gave the pan a final flick before setting it on the extinguished burner to rest and cool. Cha Cha&#39;s banter with the little gremlin slowly worming his way out onto her shoulder had put an easy smile on her face - it was so easy to fall back into the familiar dynamic. Home and safe. 

At the familiar grumblings, she glanced back from wiping her hands clean on a towel to see what the source of Cha Cha&#39;s ire was, eyes following the trail as her familiar scrambled up onto his shoulder and peered into his hand. She didn&#39;t see the blood at first, not until it had a moment to well up from below the tough calluses of a laborer&#39;s hands. In hindsight, not watching would have behooved her. But as Niamh had recently come to terms with, she was not in the business of making decisions that benefit her own well-being. The dry humor in recognizing as much was quickly drowned in the cacophony of visual noise that wracked her mind.

Images of viscera, the metallic tang in the air, the warmth of fresh blood soaking her hands and knees, all interspersed with what her eyes were actually telling her - just a small cut, still home and safe, still h<em>holding a blade slick with crimson hovering over the deck stained by ruin</em> its nothing serious and frankly she could fix it herself with the little bit of magic she had left from the day <em>but you&#39;d have more if you hadn&#39;t spent the morning goring your friends</em> and he&#39;d be good as new.
Niamh&#39;s knees buckled and hit the floor with a resonant thud, one hand tangled in the towel still as the other clutched wildly at her chest and neck as her breathing turned ragged and uneven. Her eyes started welling up again, barely registering her surroundings despite her vision flickering unprompted between her own eyes and the gaze of her familiar still unwittingly perched on Cha Cha&#39;s shoulder and clinging desperately.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Thursday, October 26, 2023 1:33 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His unbloodied hand reached out to gently grip her shoulder to help stabilize as best he could while the other curled close, afraid to dirty her with his blood <s>again.</s>

&quot;Niamh? It&#39;s alright, yer fine. C&#39;mere, c&#39;mere.&quot; He tried coaxing her back into his arms again, mindful to keep the blood away.

She tried to find the place where she steadied herself in stoicism, but her own heart lurched at the sight of the blood. Like Niamh&#39;s, Cain&#39;s mind immediately leaped back to the ship, that sticky, sanguine deck a massacre terrible to behold. She felt the blood leave her face as she was assaulted with the horrifyingly vivid memory. Even the air had been tinged with it, that oddly sweet, iron smell. Cain almost thought she could scent it lingering on their clothes, but she knew they&#39;d spelled themselves clean. Yet, the memory loitered like an unwanted guest in her mind, and it made her usual stillness difficult to grasp. She heaved a ragged breathe, and then two before trusting herself to take action.

With quick, efficient movements, she used her teeth to help rip the edge off of her shirt. It would help stem the flow of the cut, and black cloth would disguise the blood. She held the cloth out to Cha Cha, and crouched down beside Niamh and Cha Cha. She began speaking in a low, soothing tone. Her sentences were short at the start, but it seemed the act of talking grew easier as she went on.

&quot;It was a vision. No one is dead. There&#39;s no ship. Cha Cha is here, holding you. The mist took our worst nightmares and made us live them. But none of it was real. None of those people are dead.&quot; She began to repeat this, keeping up a steady stream of chatter for Niamh to focus on.

As Cain spoke, she reached her hand up to the hand Niamh was using to clutch at her chest, and interlaced their fingers and giving her hand a firm squeeze, then a second.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The world gradually began to stop swimming as she focused on the tangible sensations around her, staring intently at the simple structure of the stove as it stilled. Her breathing still came in rough pants, but she adjusted her grip on Cain&#39;s hand and returned the staccato squeeze. <em>Here</em>. <em>With you</em>.
As she regained some semblance of control her free hand reached up to find Cha Cha&#39;s chest, the pulse of his heart like a balm as her gaze darted between the two and she spoke in rapid-fire apologies.

Again and again, that question rose to Cha Cha&#39;s mind in anger and horror on their behalf; what <em>happened</em> to them? <em>They were only gone for a day!</em> He again forced the thought from the forefront of his mind as Cain shredded the edge of her shirt to get him a makeshift bandage. He wanted to say &quot;I&#39;ve got bandages, thanks,&quot; but instead heard himself thank her for it, making a mental note somewhere to get her a new shirt for the effort. As she moved in to help comfort Niamh, he withdrew his arms enough so he could see his palm -<em>barely even anything, he&#39;s shed more plenty of times before</em>- and get to wrapping.

Cain&#39;s words of affirmation were horrifying as he listened, each new sentence another bloody drop of insight into just <em>what</em> he&#39;d been wondering. He was right. He didn&#39;t want to know. But now he did, and he couldn&#39;t help but grimace as his imagination ran wild with it. He understood the missing piece of his earlier soothing words, that it wasn&#39;t <em>herself</em> she&#39;d been mourning. No wonder Niamh had looked at him with those eyes. He&#39;d hoped he&#39;d left eyes like that behind when Cas and Nils had died, leaving him to pick up the pieces. 

Wound bandaged enough that he wouldn&#39;t bleed on them, Cha Cha&#39;s arms wrapped back around the pair with renewed purpose, drawing them in as though he could shut out the whole wicked world from them if he just tried hard enough. A heavy hand curled around the back of Niamh&#39;s head, rough fingers gently brushing through her hair in a steady pattern. The heart under her hand pounded heavily, warm and alive. &quot;It&#39;s alright, I&#39;m right here. I&#39;m okay, it&#39;s just a scratch.

Real. And warm. With movement and a voice and Cain&#39;s grip an anchor to reality. She forced herself to focus on their voices at last, the ragged breathing turning heavy as she started to calm enough to catch her breath. Whatever had just seized her had taken its toll, exhaustion settling over her like a plate of steel as she let her head droop enough that her ear and temple came to rest on Cha Cha&#39;s chest beside her hand.
<em>Thump. Thump. Thump. Thump.</em>
She forced herself to take a deep, steadying breath, mournful gaze meeting Cain&#39;s as she found her voice again.
&quot;She&#39;d torn you to pieces. All of you. The feathers.. But I found you first. She put you right at my feet to make sure I would. I -- we didn&#39;t know what we were walking into, not really.

None of their deaths were permanent,&quot; she whispered back, even as a sliver of fear pierced her like an arrow as she considered the implications for her own trial. She was sure it came through on her face, as beaten down as she was by the emotional gauntlet of the day. 

Still, it was hard to let the fear run away with her in Cha Cha and Niamh&#39;s embrace, when they were both so solid and comforting right next to her. She closed her eyes, hoping Cha Cha was ok being flung with minimal context into the deep end of their trauma. She didn&#39;t think she had it within her to truly recount the mission, but hopefully Cha Cha was gleaning enough to get a sense of how badly things had gone.

&quot;We were way over our heads. Might still be. Beings with the power to summon demons from our pasts-&quot;

She choked on the words, terrified again. She managed not to go rigid, not to slip into her defenses, but it was a near thing only staved off by the group&#39;s embrace as three clung to one another.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He hoped it wasn&#39;t too forward of him, being as unfamiliar as he was, but goddamn if they didn&#39;t sound like they needed all the comfort they could get, no matter how forward.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry ya went through all that. Ya didn&#39;t deserve any of it... That&#39;s never a pretty sight, seeing the people ya care for... I wish y&#39;d have never had to see something like that.&quot; Cha Cha murmured, head shaking slowly. His sympathy cut deep, and his voice held some somber memory to it that betrayed just how much he knew what that pain felt like, once upon a time. At least his solace had been that they&#39;d all believed in what they died for, not this senseless violence and violation that gripped them.

Between the ache in Cha Cha&#39;s voice and Cain&#39;s face, the last of the tremors that shook Niamh&#39;s shoulders and rattled her breathing smoothed out into deep steadying sighs. And like the crack of a whip, a fanged sneer broke through the curtain of fatigue on her face as Cain&#39;s assurances had cut off, fear draining some of the color from her face. Curling their clasped hands against her chest, Niamh&#39;s eyes bore into Cain&#39;s as they tucked in against Cha Cha&#39;s chest.
&quot;She&#39;ll never touch you again. We won&#39;t let her. I&#39;ll gut her before she even gets close.&quot;
The venom in her face subsided after a moment, giving way to the exhaustion that had swept over her. The intensity in her gaze remained though, never leaving Cain&#39;s face even as her posture melted further against Cha Cha.
She remembered herself after a moment, gently reaching up to tug at the injured hand that had sent this disaster train rocketing down the tracks in the first place. It really was barely anything. Her stomach still twisted some at the sight, but for now at least it seemed she was too exhausted to experience more visceral reactions. With one hand quite busied with clinging to Cain&#39;s and the other dwarfed with the task of holding on to Cha Cha&#39;s, she leaned up briefly to press a soft kiss against his palm. The last vestiges of her magic warmed at the contact, and as she settled back in a soft golden glow radiated from beneath the makeshift bandage as the cut sealed back up.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The venom in Niamh&#39;s tone soothed a different part Cain, and she wondered what she had done to deserve such stalwart support. With the barest whisper, Cain spoke. &quot;The last time I tried to kill her, she escaped. I was basically driven out of my guild. No one sided with me. They were all too eager to jockey in the power vacuum left in the wake of my failure.&quot;

Cain was worn down, felt the length of the day all the way to her bones. She clung with desperation to Niamh&#39;s hand, not lifting her head from Cha Cha&#39;s shoulder. She drank in the still tranquility, tried to replace her panic with tangible things. She counted out her environment... The steady rise and fall of Cha Cha&#39;s breathing, the intermittent <em>I&#39;m with you; I&#39;m here</em> squeezes from Niamh. She could smell their cooking, and with an idle thought reached up to turn the burner under the hot chocolate off.

Niamh&#39;s snarl had been easily convincing. He didn&#39;t have to know Cain too well to decide he&#39;d fight for her.

He watched Niamh as she gently grabbed his hand to examine the wound, bracing himself for another round of much needed comfort before exhaling a silent sigh of relief as it seemed to wash over with far less effective destruction than before. He hadn&#39;t expected her to press a kiss to his palm, nor for her to use it to heal the cut, that little warm glow of magic tingling his skin in a way that lingered. It took him a moment to blink, clearing his throat to murmur a thanks. His fingers curled around hers to give it a gentle squeeze, eyes lifting to follow Cain&#39;s wise decision to turn off the burner. She too got a thanks and a little squeeze from his arm since his hands were occupied.

While the pair seemed content to cuddle up on the floor, Cha Cha eyed the couch. With a deep inhale, he cleared his throat again, speaking softly. &quot;C&#39;mon. Let&#39;s get ya somewhere more comfortable.&quot;

He would suffer no protesting, his arms withdrawing from their secure hugs to shift until he could hook fingers under legs and hips with enough leverage. With a grunt he rose and brought the pair of them with him carefully over to the couch where he could deposit them somewhere <em>decidedly</em> more comfortable than a wooden floor. He withdrew again, grabbing the spare blanket to drape around the pair and tuck them in just enough before crouching before them, one knee on the floor. &quot;Will ya be okay if I leave ya here and finish cookin fer ya?&quot; he asked, looking between them.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, October 29, 2023 2:16 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She did not, however, anticipate both of them being lifted gently into the air as easily as if they were children, carried over 
and tucked in on the couch. She put up no resistance in the process, instead opting to blink owlishly at Cain as they were lifted off the floor and then gawk at Cha Cha as he swaddled them. When she spoke again, the fatigue that had put some strain on her voice had lost some of its edge.

Cain offered no complaint as Cha Cha went to relocate them, but his effortless ease at lifting both Niamh and Cain at once did shock her into the present moment as she wondered how strong the man actually was. Cain felt an odd sense of... being care for as Cha Cha nested them onto the couch. Amid the sounds of him finishing the meat preparations in the kitchen, Cain shook her head, trying to fling the last dusty recollections out of her mind. 

&quot;Do you still want hot chocolate?&quot; Cain whispered from the blanket nest. She wriggled her flask out of the interior of her garments, wagging her eyebrows as she offered the flask to Niamh. &quot;This ought to doctor it nicely.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He gave the hot chocolate a sniff before turning the burner back on ton finish it up as best he could without adding any more of the now-bloody chocolate. The steaks were transferred to plates with slices of buttered toast, then hot cocoa poured into a pair of mugs and topped with cinnamon and nutmeg.

Carrying the plates on one arm and both mugs in the other, he carefully moved his way back to the couch to dole out a mug and plate to each of them. &quot;Sorry it ain&#39;t much,&quot; he said, as though he&#39;d had the time or foresight to do a little extra grocery shopping for guests. As if he wouldn&#39;t have insisted on going with them or instead of them, had he known what had awaited them.

He snagged his drink and plate from the table and settled onto the couch as well to join them, though he seemed more intent on making sure they were alright than eating anything more. &quot;If ya want, ya can stay here for the night. The spare room&#39;s clean... or I guess the couch isn&#39;t too bad either if ya prefer that. Can even lend ya a shirt to sleep in, though it eh.

She perked back up at Cain&#39;s voice though, leaning back slightly so her body weight wasn&#39;t an additional hurdle in the process of dredging up the flask. Flashing a conspiratorial smile, she snuggled back into position with a hum of approval and gingerly held the flask before them between the tips of her fingers, as if reverent. &quot;Aye, and that&#39;s a quick trip to a deep sleep if ever I&#39;ve seen one.&quot;
Her attention turned as Cha Cha presented the plates prepared for them, her stomach suddenly awakening with an agitated grumble as though the rest of her body suddenly remembered that it had needs beyond wine and trail snacks. With a sheepish grimace, she rearranged herself amidst the blankets to make room for Cha Cha and better access the plate - and the two mugs that she topped off with whiskey after taking a generous sip from her own. Passing Cain&#39;s hot chocolate back to her as Cha Cha offered to share his space for the evening, a guilty look rose up into her face and drooped her shoulders as she instinctively reached for Cain&#39;s hand under the blankets.
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry for all of the... Everything. This was just supposed to be a quick check in - thought it&#39;d be helpful to be able to see with my own eyes that you were fine and unharmed, and Cain was good enough to come with me since I&#39;m still leaning on her being here like an anchor. I wasn&#39;t.. I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d crumble on sight.&quot; Her gaze slid away at the admission, a flush rising into her cheeks as she flashed an apologetic glance at Cain as well. A right mess this ended up being - though she couldn&#39;t shy away from the fact that she probably needed it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There wasn&#39;t much he felt like he <em>could</em> do to help in this scenario, but it was more than anything he could have done had they not come to him to check up.

His frown deepened as Cain mentioned Yarrow, <em>and</em> his leaving them. He grumbled to himself, some vague sounding words like <em>irresponsible</em> and <em>the nerve of some men.</em> The gears in his head turned a little to try and think of anything else he could offer to fill the Yarrow-sized gap in their evening - well, there was likely a lot Yarrow provided that.. wasn&#39;t proper, but surely there was something. &quot;I.. <em>definitely</em> ain&#39;t Yarrow, but I&#39;ll do what I can here for ya in the meantime.

Her expression shifted from grateful for Cha Cha&#39;s comfort to bemused at Cain&#39;s self-proclaimed selfishness, and finally to weary as the matter of the Yarrow-shaped absence was addressed. Setting her emptied plate down, she settled back under the blanket and fished around for Cain&#39; s elbow, looping their arms together as a smile crept onto her face at Cha Cha&#39;s muttered admonishing of the aasimar. 
&quot;Cha Cha you have already let us ruin your quiet evening of carving,&quot; she began, gesturing at the half-finished bird and the pile of wood shavings that still had an aromatic cloud hanging above them. &quot;You let us get blubbery without shying away and fed us with the last of your groceries because I know you haven&#39;t been in to see Gregor yet even though he&#39;s definitely prepared a basket for you in thanks for the jam you brought,&quot; she added, one brow creeping up her forehead in accusation.
&quot;If you do anything more for us I&#39;ll have no choice but to start turning down more missions to try and be as good a person as you are. And that severely lowers our ability to pressure would-be employers into paying us a fairer sum for the traumas we subject ourselves to,&quot; she grumbled, her eyes scanning the room to take inventory of which food staples he was out of, already planning a reverse-heist to get his pantry restocked.
&quot;As for Yarrow, he&#39;s.. <em>ugh</em>. He&#39;s ideally securing our navigator to the Shattered Isles - or whatever the true name is.&quot; She sank further into the couch then, the exhaustion settling back into her face.
&quot;At the heart of all this trouble is a stolen artifact, taken by a group of <em>colonizers</em>,&quot; she spat, a spark of fire alight in her eye before the fatigue took over again. &quot;It contains... Or at least we think it houses a giant fuck-all monster, Ephialtes. He&#39;s a protector though - it would have been wrong to kill him. So we&#39;re taking him home.&quot; A distant look briefly crossed her face as she felt the onset of a realization relating to sailing and being back in open water, and back in the territories of certain ne&#39;er-do-wells. It passed as quickly as it came on though, as Niamh found herself entirely too tired to grapple with that particular realization this evening. &quot;Found a lot of colonizer research and observation of the local peoples they robbed and slaughtered - one was a dictionary, and Yarrow recognized some of the script.&quot; She looked directly up at Cha Cha then, her jaw tensing.
&quot;You remember the kid from the other day - dark haired, short, scrawny? Said his name was Kelnari? That rune on his forehead, it&#39;s from that alphabet.&quot; Some of the tension crept back in then, an uneasy expression on her face.
&quot;We&#39;re pretty sure he&#39;s involved in this somehow. Yarrow&#39;s pretty confident, anyway - but he insisted he trusts him.&quot; At that, she cast an uneasy glance at Cain. &quot;We&#39;re.. not so sure. Nuala being unsettled about someone always gets my hackles up, and suddenly there&#39;s a potential connection with a creature that wrung our worst nightmares out and tormented us with them. So.&quot; She huffed a tired sigh, eyes closing as she reclined her head against the back of the couch, her arm squeezing Cain&#39;s as she muttered to her. &quot;Did I miss anything?&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, October 30, 2023 10:51 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She&#39;d inhaled her plate, the simple fair delicious, comforting, and filling. She slipped a hand over to Cha Cha&#39;s, weaving her fingers through his and giving a quick squeeze of thanks meant to encompass her gratefulness for dinner and all the things Niamh was mentioning, before retreating back into her own space. When Cain had returned, she&#39;d been so spooked by her visions that she&#39;d contemplated skipping town. She knew she couldn&#39;t really, that Ephialtes would find her if she did, but the temptation had been there. With Niamh and now Cha Cha as grounding points, Cain felt a little less like disappearing into the night.

As Cain listened to Niamh&#39;s further explanation, she nodded that <em>Yes, Yarrow was securing a navigator</em>. Just because it was logical did not mean she enjoyed the separation, but Cain knew there was nothing to be done about it. Her mouth pulled into a moue of distaste as Niamh mentioned Jhaal and his expeditions. &quot;By all accounts, these people just wanted to be left alone, and this pompous windbag got it in his head that they were hiding riches and wonders he was entitled to. Ephialtes took him, and it was deserved.&quot; By the end of her statement, Cain&#39;s tone had adopted a sort of righteous scorn. 

&quot;Don&#39;t know what to make of Kelnari myself. He seems bookish enough, quiet and unassuming. Then again, I&#39;ve known individuals just like that who have... a less than savory skill set. Nuala&#39;s description of him was &#39;predator,&#39; if I recall correctly. But, it&#39;s not like certain people I&#39;ve passed in life wouldn&#39;t describe me the same way.&quot; Cain shrugged, clearly conflicted. &quot;I&#39;m a little concerned that he&#39;s our link back to these lands and getting a terrifying Ephialtes off our backs. I only hope he&#39;s as reliable as we need him to be.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He&#39;d been <em>meaning</em> to, he&#39;d just been busy- was he <em>that</em> consistent, or was she just that sharp? His cheeks darkened just a smidge at her words, clearing his throat after a moment to mutter a sheepish &quot;It&#39;s- I&#39;m sure you&#39;d do the same for me.&quot;

He let out an amused exhale at her accusation of him being a good man before being blessedly distracted by Cain&#39;s fingers weaving with his to give a grateful squeeze. He looked to her with another surprised blink but smiled, returning the squeeze gently. He&#39;d already decided he liked her well enough. This only seemed to endear her a little more to him with each little gesture.

He cleared his throat as Niamh groaned and began explaining their predicament. A frown took his lips, accompanied by a thoughtful but troubled hum. There wasn&#39;t much he liked in anything the pair said about the situation. It sounded like a dangerous journey on a good day, and a downright perilous one adding in all the little complications. Though he concluded Ephialtes was certainly dangerous, what little they explained on the situation gave him little reason to deny their assessments. He&#39;d been pissed too when people killed his friends. He&#39;d probably be pissed about being trapped in a box, too. The mention of Kelnari reminded him of the gentle soul he&#39;d met briefly in the streets while out jam-slinging, and the similar vibes he&#39;d gotten in the bar afterwards.

Settling back in his seat on the couch, he stroked his beard. &quot;... I was just talkin with him earlier in the bar, him and the new tailor in town... Ya say he&#39;s related to all this? I didn&#39;t get much of that from him when we spoke, other than he seemed like he didn&#39;t know what to do with himself. Told him he needed some winter clothes or he&#39;d freeze if he stuck around town much longer.&quot;

Still, Nuala&#39;d called him a predator. She certainly was perhaps more cautious than he was about strangers, but he wasn&#39;t about to ignore her guts on it. He&#39;d been wrong about people before, after all. Despite that, he couldn&#39;t really think of anything that would corroborate with her description. He let out a disgruntled noise or two, scratching his chin some more. &quot;I hope he&#39;s reliable too. If not, I mean.. I guess I could just throw &#39;im over my shoulder and carry him with us. It ain&#39;t like we&#39;re trying to go rob the place.&quot;

While he&#39;d been doing his own thing helping out the many townsfolk he&#39;d befriended, it sounded like he&#39;d invited himself along with helping them return the artifact. After everything they&#39;ve been describing all evening, it was the least he could do after not being there for them earlier.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, October 30, 2023 4:33 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There were a lot of things about the mission that she would have liked to have changed, but leaving the man to his fate - to answer to the dragon for as long as the Guardian deemed his penance needed to be? She would make that choice every time, a hundred times over. Her expression turned sympathetic as Cain seemed to struggle with wanting to give the stranger the benefit of the doubt - and subsequent concerns with relying on him to guide them to the island that would alleviate them of their newly acquired woes.
What she hadn&#39;t anticipated though was Cha Cha&#39; s added familiarity with Kel, the prospect setting her unsettlingly still as her jaw worked with the revelation. But as she kept reminding herself, Cha Cha was here and unharmed far as she could tell. Yarrow had spent significantly more time with the stranger and, as far as they knew, was no worse off for it. She never doubted Nuala&#39;s intuition, but since getting to town her lived experience was a testament to the value of making informed judgments - for better and for worse.
She had also not anticipated Cha Cha&#39;s liberal use of &quot;we&quot; and &quot;us&quot; in reference to their upcoming venture. After a moment of blinking blankly at him, she found herself chewing the inside of her cheek to suppress the start of a soft smile as she turned briefly to exchange a look with Cain.
&quot;No, certainly not trying to take anything more from these people than they&#39;ve already lost. Which may take some convincing on our part, but I think explaining that there&#39;s a gargantuan centipede nightmare breathing down our necks would be decently compelling.&quot;
Wiggling herself deeper into the couch-nest, she tucked her hot chocolate in closer to her chest and finally cracked a familiar grin looking between her two companions.

The only time she traveled without clothes for all seasons was... when she didn&#39;t plan to be around long enough for it to matter. Brow furrowing as she thought, Cain nestled deeper into the blankets. There were plenty of reasons someone might not plan to stick around long enough to need winter clothing; she only hoped Kelnari&#39;s reasons were above board.

Her smile slipped off as Cha Cha spoke, made his intentions to come with them known.

&quot;I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s wise for you to embroil yourself in this. His Royal Centipedeness made it clear this was not a good deal for us. It seemed like he was desiring more to kill us outright.&quot;

To Niamh&#39;s question, Cain only snorted a laugh. &quot;Been on ships plenty, deploying out to various ports for various endeavors.&quot; Cain gestured dismissively, glossing over the specifics of those engagements with a practiced ease. &quot;But crewed a ship myself? Never. My guild had other experts for that.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I know ya ain&#39;t damsels, ya can take care of yourselves, ya got the muscles for it. But sometimes the difference in a fight can be made with just one more shield.&quot; His gaze drifted to the wall where he&#39;d made a nice mount for his silvered warhammer and new kite shield, the brilliant reds and darksteel shining with the promise of strong defense. &quot;Besides, I ain&#39;t gotten a chance to use this yet. It&#39;s gotta make a living too.&quot;

His more serious expression drifted at the question of boats, replaced with an almost sheepish grimace. &quot;Never sailed a ship before, and I haven&#39;t had the best of times with boats. I eh, prefer my feet on the ground.&quot; He paused. &quot;Swimming&#39;s fine though. Not that I could doggy paddle my way to a mysterious island.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Involving anyone else in this mission, particularly people they cared about, was indeed an unwise move. Nonethess, she couldn&#39;t help but feel relieved at his insistence on coming along. If he was present then he could be protected - not that she would ever admit as much, knowing full well he&#39;d turn the sentiment back on her before the words left her mouth. Her gaze followed Cha Cha&#39;s to the shield on the wall, and she felt the familiar swell of pride at the place of honor the group gift for him had been given. She cracked a grin as he pointed out its lingering status as purely wall art so far, nodding agreeably before turning to Cain.
&quot;Aye, we got him that one to replace the big ol&#39; barricade shield he lost up in Laracus. Same mission where we rescued Nuala - pissed off big daddy lycan bad enough that he had to throw down that steel wall just to buy us time to get the hell out of there. Son of a bitch was a real piece of work - he&#39;ll get his soon though,&quot; she muttered, a sneer creeping into her face as she sipped from her mug.
&quot;All the same,&quot; she waved a hand dismissively, turning back to Cain with another tired smile. &quot;We&#39;ll want people that we trust unquestioningly to crew the ship. Particularly if we&#39;re going to convince an entire civilization of scorned people that we&#39;re here to right wrongs and not introduce new problems. &#39;Sides, Yarrow and I can teach you the basics while were at port, Meos too if we can find him - shouldn&#39;t be a large ship, I&#39;d figure a schooner would suffice.&quot; Her expression turned thoughtful as she downed the last of her drink, setting the mug down beside her plate. Looking back up between the two of them, she looped her arms around their elbows with a fanged grin. &quot;All that besides, I&#39;m good with knots but we&#39;ll want some extra muscle for the more hands-on tasks,&quot; she explained with a familiar cheekiness, patting their biceps with the respective hand.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In a sense, she could relate, although the list of people she&#39;d volunteer for a hell mission currently could be counted on one hand. She patted his arm, apparently deciding he couldn&#39;t be talked out of it. &quot;Just because we have muscle doesn&#39;t mean more would be remiss. You and that fine shield can earn your keep. Just- if you&#39;ve-&quot; Cain tried to sound strong, but there was a wavering edge to her voice. &quot;Your worst nightmares, darkest experiences. Probably be prepared to face them again. I think this errand won&#39;t be kind to individuals with a difficult past.&quot; Cain wasn&#39;t fully certain that Cha Cha qualified, but based on a few of his statements when he&#39;d comforted them in the kitchen, she thought the warning valid.

Said caution delivered, Cain appeared lost in her mind, draining the last of her hot chocolate before splashing more whiskey into her mug. Niamh&#39;s musing were a gift, and Cain eagerly latched on a chance to joke.

&quot;Well, I&#39;m a pretty deft hand with ropes, although you&#39;re welcome to teach me seafaring knots anytime soon.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Every day seeing her out and about was one he counted as a blessing, a memory of pride and confirmation he&#39;d done the right thing. &quot;Should probably give the.. what did they call themselves, the Claret Orders? Give em a holler, see if they&#39;ve learned anything new since then. It&#39;s been too quiet, now that I think about it.&quot;

He gave a shake of his head, looking back to the pair and the offers to teach the finer points of seafaring. He smiled a little and snorted at the bicep pap, though quietly he wondered just <em>how</em> useful he&#39;d be on a ship. At the very least he could help load and unload.. it was all the in-between bits he wasn&#39;t too sure about. Still, they&#39;d have his muscle one way or another. He&#39;d already signed himself up, and he wasn&#39;t about to back out now just because of a little water. &quot;Oh, I&#39;ll give ya muscle.&quot; He said with more confidence than he felt, nodding with a huff.

Noting the draining of mugs and empty plates, he coaxed his arm free to began collecting the empty dishes, though he left Cain her mug for the time being as she splashed a little extra in the bottom. He frowned gently at her warning and the halting emotion that came with it but nodded, once again touched she cared enough to warn him of it. &quot;Aye. I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve had it all too easy, but I chose this life. I&#39;ve survived the worst before. I can do it again. Though, it would be nice to have a helping hand this time around if it comes to that.&quot;

Grunting he stood from the couch, giving both of them a little ruffle on the top of their heads before stealing away with the empty dishes. Despite his confident response regarding the prospect of facing hell, it didn&#39;t mean he <em>liked</em> the idea. No. He&#39;d meant it when he said he could do it again... He just hoped that if it came down to it, they wouldn&#39;t hate him for any of it.

Clearing his throat, he glanced over his shoulder. &quot;You&#39;ll have to teach me ropes too, I&#39;ve always been lousy with knots.&quot; He said casually, in a way that suggested he had not quite caught the underlying playful nature of the comment.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She became pliable under his hand though as he mussed their hair, eventually settling back into the nest to curl up beside Cain as the banter was returned. A grin had already slid into her face in response, but it took on a wild edge as Cha Cha responded in kind without any of the subtext.
&quot;Absolutely.

Cain chuckled under her breath, and turned an absolute shit eating grin in Niamh&#39;s direction. Catching Niamh&#39;s mused hair as she did, Cain gave another chuckle and reached over to smooth down the wayward strands. Her touch lingered, gentle and full of her gratefulness that the mist and darkness hadn&#39;t claimed either of them, that she and Niamh had found Cha Cha hale, for this entire evening. 

&quot;There. Wouldn&#39;t want the illustrious instructor of Ropes and Knots Class to show up looking disheveled.&quot; Cain&#39;s tone had started out normal, but she was giggling by the end of it.

Once done with the dishes he moseyed back over to the couch, wiping his hands off on a stray rag to watch the pair. Gentle touches he felt almost voyeuristic to watch aside, they were in much better spirits than they had been upon their arrival, and that he would take as a win. Well, spirits wasn&#39;t too far off of a word for it, he decided as Cain giggled.

Tossing the rag onto the side table he quirked an amused brow. &quot;Yer starting to sound like ya could use a nice long nap. Frankly, I&#39;m starting to feel it too now. Are ya comfy here?

Silently, she made a promise to behave while actually teaching them something. Though, no, that felt too concrete - a promise to <em>try</em> to behave. Better. Always good to be gracious with one&#39;s weaknesses.
At the sound of Cha Cha&#39;s footsteps she managed to open her eyes enough to give a few bleary blinks in acknowledgement, and felt a smile crack her face in response to the last of his questions.

Were she sober enough to realize, it was wise that Niamh and Cain stay with Cha Cha. Cain had nightmares on a good day, and today had been decidedly not that. Some distant part of her recognized that it would be good for Niamh to be here too, able to check on him in the evening if needed, although Cain wasn&#39;t cognizant enough to voice the thought.

Her head felt pleasantly full of cotton, and she&#39;d finally managed to divert her mind from its hellbent desire of wandering directly to her memories of their time in the misty manor. She wrangled her thoughts back to the present, blinking at Cha Cha as she realized he&#39;d asked a question. &quot;Yes please,&quot; Cain answered happily, not really realizing Cha Cha hadn&#39;t asked a yes or no question. But, she raised her arms to Cha Cha as well, understanding and sharing Niamh&#39;s desire.

If he&#39;d had the kind of day they had, he&#39;d probably want to be carried to bed too. He knelt down into their outstretched arms this time as his own curled around underneath to secure themselves. He was strong, yes, but another good part of his carrying was simply a fullhearted determination to <em>not</em> drop either of them. What was he going to do, carry them <em>one at a time? When they were like this?</em> Absolutely not.

Grunting, he lifted both up into the air again, giving them the lightest of tosses to adjust his grip more firmly beneath the pair before turning towards the guest bedroom, only to pause.

The shut front of the door greeted him, the doorknob mocking his intended destination. <em>What now, bear man? Gonna use your foot?</em>

He was good, but he wasn&#39;t <em>that</em> good. With a small clear of his throat, he pinched his eyes briefly before heading towards the cracked door of his bedroom instead. That he could at least shoulder open the rest of the way without setting either of them down. Could he have asked one of them to open the door? Probably, if he&#39;d thought of it. He did not. Instead, he reasoned that they could have his bed and he could sleep in the other room.

The interior of Cha Cha&#39;s room was more or less the same as the rest of this cozy room he called home. Inside was a bookshelf, a wardrobe, a desk and nightstand, most pieces stock and others supplemented or obviously repaired/doctored to his tastes. The wood was decorated in careful knotwork, some of it utterly unfinished as though it were a project he did only on a whim. A map hung on the wall above his desk with names and routes scattered across - some of them Niamh might recognize had she the clarity of mind, strangers mentioned fondly in passing mention by the man carrying them. A broad, tattered testament to the people he kept in contact with as best as he could.

He slid around the side of the bed and carefully lowered the pair onto it. The twin bed had been replaced with a larger frame that better suited a man of Cha Cha&#39;s stature, which meant it had plenty of room for the pair. &quot;There ya go, easy now.&quot; He murmured, loosening a hand to grab at the covers to begin tucking them in.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not that her judgment was at its best in this moment, addled with fatigue and a bit of booze, so she would need to revisit that metric come morning. Somewhere buried deep inside her and beneath the sleepiness there was a giddy kid excited to be carried effortlessly again. The exhausted adult though just melted into Cha Cha&#39;s shoulder, tucking her forehead against his neck as she lazily grabbed at Cain&#39;s hand, twined their fingers together, and gave a little squeeze - once, twice. She cracked one eye open as she felt his pace pivot though, and quietly watched as Cha Cha&#39;s own room came into view. It narrowed slightly as a single coherent suspicion bubbled to the surface that was very Cha Cha-like, confirmed almost immediately when he began tucking her and Cain in and himself remained standing. This simply Would Not Do. Both the injustice of kicking the poor man out of his own bed, but also the tiny, ringing thread of panic that remained taut in her heart like a plucked lute string.
Sidling further into the middle of the bed, she tugged Cain&#39;s arm around her middle until she&#39;d cemented herself as the little spoon between the two of them, leaving a decent measure of space left on her other side. In the dim light she pawed gingerly at the movement of the blankets until she found his hand, bringing hers to rest on his wrist as she peered up at him with wide amber eyes and spoke in tones as hushed as the night itself.
&quot;Are you leaving?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Cain took a similar approach as Niamh, resting her head against Cha Cha and marveling at the uniqueness of being carried. Although her eyes were open enough to ascertain that doors were a problem, she was too comfortable and tired to be of any use solving said issue. She hummed a happy sound as Cha Cha redirected. &quot;I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re smarter than doors,&quot; she whispered to Cha Cha in her head again (and also audibly).

The scents of the bed she was deposited in were novel, but overwhelmingly safe. Cain&#39;s eyes slipped closed of their own accord as her body went limp. She was half asleep already when Niamh slid next to her, but Cain roused enough to bestow a lingering kiss on Niamh&#39;s forehead as she wrapped her arms around her friend. The touch was so comforting, grounding, and Cain was nothing if not a touchy, greedy drunk.

&quot;You should stay so we know you&#39;re safe.&quot;

In that dreamlike, honest way she&#39;d been speaking, Cain again whispered her inner thoughts to the room. This time, though she sought Cha Cha&#39;s eyes, pleading in support of her desired outcome to Niamh&#39;s question.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Of all the things he&#39;d been called, Tree wasn&#39;t really a nickname ascribed to him, but he found he liked it. Or maybe he just enjoyed the sleepy tipsy compliments whispered with absolute earnestness.

He paused to watch as Niamh skootched over to make room, her pawing hand finding his wrist and stilling him the rest of the way with a blink. <em>Are you leaving?</em> He hadn&#39;t considered staying was an option, he belatedly realized. A sound lodged itself in his throat for a moment, leaving him quiet enough for Cain&#39;s earnestness to whisper in tandem, in invitation. With both of their eyes on him, he found it very difficult to refute the request. After all, he&#39;d chastised Yarrow for leaving earlier. Surely he&#39;d be a hypocrite to <em>also</em> leave, wouldn&#39;t he?

He cleared his throat before rumbling a soft &quot;I can stay.&quot; Not giving himself a chance to back out, he slipped into bed into the space the pair had left him. Though the bed was larger than standard, it wasn&#39;t entirely designed for three people. Three people snuggled close with tangled arms and legs though, it had just enough space for.

<em>Ach, hell with it.</em> They wanted him there. He&#39;d be there. He slid in close, arms hesitantly lacing around the pair with unpracticed fondness that felt easier the longer they lay together. It struck him suddenly just how comforting it was to <em>him,</em> even though he&#39;d not been privy to the day&#39;s events, like an ache he hadn&#39;t realized he had. Exhaling a cathartic sigh, he buried his face in Niamh&#39;s hair as he snuggled in even more, pressing a small kiss to the back of her head.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She&#39;d gotten hugs from Cha Cha before and of course had complimented him on his good form, but that did not prepare her for the comfort and warmth that came as he curled up behind her, the weight of his arm resting across her curled around Cain. She breathed deeply of the scent of whiskey that still swirled between the girls, and the woody musk that Cha Cha brought as he curled up behind her, and she wondered if she&#39;d ever have a night of sleep as restful and comfortable as the one they were tucking in for. As she waited for sleep to take her, her fingers wound idly into Cain&#39; s hair to scratch lazily against her head. 
The gentle press against the back of her head surprised her though, as she recognized the feel of warm breath against her hair. Any lingering breath that had remained in her chest left in a long, deep exhale as she relaxed into the tangle of limbs, sidling back the last inch or so until she was flush against Cha Cha&#39; s curled frame with Cain tucked against her chest. Drunk with bliss, she finally let herself drift to sleep.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Tuesday, October 31, 2023 7:32 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ever weak for someone playing with her hair, Cain focused entirely on the blissful sensation. She had zero resistance, allowing her body to slot against Niamh&#39;s in a comforting, warm embrace. Still greedy, still shameless in that way that an affectionate drunk could be and wanting more touch and connection if they were offered, Cain wove one of her legs through Niamh&#39;s and Cha Cha&#39;s, hooking her foot around Cha Cha&#39;s ankle as their limbs tangled. Although the bed wasn&#39;t necessarily built for three, Cain personally was thrilled with this. She snuck an arm across Niamh&#39;s waist and wove a finger through a loop on Cha Cha&#39;s pants, simply resting like that and luxuriating in another point of contact. Her last conscious action was to bestow a soft kiss at the hollow of Niamh&#39;s throat before slipping into the darkness of sleep.

Cain&#39;s evening passed fitfully, despite the warm and welcoming circle of limbs and shared space she inhabited. Sleep was ever elusive to Cain (something she&#39;d taken advantage of in her chosen professions), and she jolted awake in a panic multiple times throughout the night. Finding Niamh and Cha Cha immediately within arm&#39;s reach was a salve to her mind, a tangible and forceful redirection from the bloodred deck of the ship, or Nyx&#39;s ever present threat to <em>find</em> Cain and destroy whatever Cain held dear. Each time she awoke, Cain quietly sipped from her flask to top up her mildly inebriated state, deathly fearful of the conjurings her sober mind was capable of producing. She found herself relieved when the crest of morning light finally began painting the room with pinks and golds of the new day.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1169348476681846865 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1169348476681846865><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, November 1, 2023 11:53 AM">11:53 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Blinking blearily, she gazed around the room with a vaguely curious eye, although her vantage point was fairly limited from the bed.

Snaking her arm back across Niamh and Cha Cha, Cain rested her hand on Cha Cha&#39;s hip, taking great solace in holding the other two. Niamh, at least, Cain hoped to convince to sleep together for the foreseeable future, although she&#39;d absolutely welcome Cha Cha&#39;s comforting presence also. She anticipated that it would take quite some time before she slept through the night alone, and she couldn&#39;t find any shame or embarrassment for how needy she&#39;d been last night. Shrugging mentally, she wove her other hand through Niamh&#39;s, continued to drift in her half asleep fugue state until the others roused.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Despite the lack of proper sleep on his part as well, Cha Cha had found the tangle of limbs and comforts to be something he relished the feeling of. Even if it had just been for one night to help the pair, he was happy enough that they&#39;d let him provide it. The call of the morning sun fully roused him with his usual habit of rising early, though... he could stay in bed just a little longer while the pair stayed sleeping. Smacking his lips lightly to stave away the night&#39;s dry breath, he reburied his face into the back of Niamh&#39;s head while his hand gave Cain&#39;s another comforting stroke.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Decades of being tuned in to the motion of a boat with one ear peeled for any kind of alarm, followed by years of mercenary work, all ensured that she would seldom be caught unawares. This night though, she slept like the dead. Blessedly free of nightmares, but also void of dreams. Through the night she was little more than a dead weight snuggled in between Cain and Cha Cha that mindlessly adjusted at their stirrings through the night, be it tucking Cain back in to her chest or laying her arm over Cha Cha&#39;s when he soothed her fitful sleep.
The creeping morning sun failed to rouse her as it normally did, drawing only a soft hum as she nestled her face into Cain&#39;s hair to blot out the light. It wasnt until she felt the soft shifting movement of the other two that she gave a resigned sigh, stretching one leg out with enough effort that it sent The Good Trembles up the rest of her body. Satiated, she grunted softly and curled one arm beneath Cain while the other tugged Cha Cha&#39;s hand up to her chest.

Just because she was used to running on little to no sleep didn&#39;t mean Cha Cha was. His whispered reassurances were like a lighthouse  in the storm of her nightmares, though, calming her with his stalwart presence. It felt strange to process her trauma in such a non-destructive manner. Her modus operandi for dealing with unwanted consequences was a panicked bolting to the next town, or to drink herself into oblivion... each action often but not always accompanied by a good fuck. Her current ability to receive care and comfort was at least novel, although being in such uncharted waters didn&#39;t settle her guilt. In the dawning quiet of the new day, Cain wove her fingers through Cha Cha&#39;s, a small penance for the fitful sleep she&#39;d given him. She marinated in this quiet until Niamh&#39;s voice roused her fully.

Cain yawned into Niamh&#39;s clavicle, giving a teasing nip to the bone before she opened her sleep dusted eyes. Her muscles ached, and she belated realized she&#39;d not had proper healing. She tested her legs, finding that the evening&#39;s rest had soothed many of her aches away. She blinked again, still slightly tipsy, and squeezed each of her companion&#39;s hands (once, twice to Niamh) before she pulled her own hands to her face and groaned into them rubbing her eyes with her fingers.

&quot;Fuck, I could go for a coffee.&quot; She scowled at her flask, which was on Cha Cha&#39;s nightstand, having finally proven empty a hour or so before dawn.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Just to make sure they looked like they were alright, though he&#39;d been awake just enough throughout the night that it hardly seemed necessary for anything other than his own comfort. He returned Cain&#39;s squeeze before releasing her hand, finding the touch easier to reciprocate each time as comfort grew. The hand in Niamh&#39;s was easily pulled in and he instinctively gave her a reassuring stroke - before belatedly realizing just where his hand was with widening blinks.

He cleared his throat and smoothly began pulling free of their tangled limbs, disguising the motion with a stretch he desperately needed anyways. Cain&#39;s request did not go unheard, and in his mind he thanked her for giving him something else he could focus on for the time being. Facing away so they couldn&#39;t see the red in his cheeks, he glanced briefly over his shoulder with a nod. &quot;Let me see if I&#39;ve got any left for ya.&quot;

He pulled himself to stand and rolled his shoulders before moving over to his wardrobe, opening a drawer to pull out a fresh shirt. Fingers paused, curled in the hem of his before he let go and instead pulled out two more for them, giving them a light toss onto the bed. &quot;Here,  ya can wear these for now if ya want, that way ya don&#39;t have to wear yesterday&#39;s shirts.&quot;

And with that, he took his shirt out of the room to change his with some small privacy, shutting the bedroom door to a crack so they could have theirs.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Damn the sun for having the audacity to rise.
As Cha Cha started moving around the room with the intention of acquiring coffee, she let her head loll over to watch him with a thoughtful expression. As his extra shirts were tossed their way though, her eyes finally opened fully in mild surprise. She waited until the door was mostly closed before turning her head to meet Cain&#39;s gaze, a grin creeping onto her face and a gleam in her eye. Without any further hesitation, she sat up and shucked off the shirt she&#39;d slept in, eagerly sliding into the well-worn and much larger one she&#39;d been provided. Speaking a little louder to be heard through the door, she called out to Cha Cha.

Either of her companions would easily intuit that Cain simply was not a morning person, rather than having any actual complaint. She propped up on her elbows, mumbling something about how she hadn&#39;t actually been demanding he make her coffee... especially since she&#39;d already eaten through his dinner reserves. 

&quot;Think he&#39;s ever had two women in his bed before?&quot; Cain&#39;s whisper to Niamh was full of good natured ribbing, and the snort she finished her statement with wasn&#39;t mocking but rather full of affection. She scooted to the edge of the bed, pulling her own shirt off without a hint of the decorum or modesty that Cha Cha had shown. If Niamh got an eye-full in the process, all the better. Finding Niamh of a similar mindset, Cain flashed her a wink.

Of a sense to respect his unstated request for space, Cain dallied a moment before slipping on her own clean shirt that Cha Cha was certain to never get back from her. She knocked on the door, waiting a beat before sticking her head out. 

&quot;Afraid I won&#39;t take no for an answer; we definitely owe you breakfast. Got a favorite haunt? We can all go together.&quot; 

Cain gave a winsome smile, clearly already doing the mental calculus of her and Niamh being somewhere in public with Cha Cha while wearing his clothing.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He paused, glancing back at the door again as he realized they were already done and here he was, poking around at old coffee grounds while half-dressed like some sort of sloppy bachelor. Clearing his throat, he set the grounds down to toss his shirt on the rest of the way, that fading blush growing back a smidge. Swiftly slipping from view, the pair could easily catch an eyeful of the plentiful scars, blood-red tattoos decorating his torso, and his similarly ever-present necklace with a wooden totem. Likely a familiar sight in the summer months though, early in the guild training grounds as he worked out every morning that was a rarer sight now that the cold crept in during the morning.

&quot;If you&#39;re insisting.. there&#39;s a few cafe&#39;s around, but honestly the inn&#39;s got good coffee and breakfast. Usually a little cheaper, too.&quot; He said thoughtfully, his mind blissfully distracted from thoughts of Implications ™️.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

By the time Cain had peeked around the door, Niamh had just about finished tucking the hem of the shirt into her pants and the sleeves under her bracers, creating a very poet-shirt appeal. The laced v-cut at the neck she recognized as a very standard fit on Cha Cha, but was deeply amused to find that on her frame it plunged a fair way further. Tugging the laces a touch more snugly, she flashed Cain a toothy grin and struck a pose before joining her peeking.
&quot;Inn&#39;s a great idea. Breakfast at Val&#39;s was a must-have first few weeks I was in town before I got settled. And we can swing by for groceries after,&quot; she added with a decisive nod before slipping through the door, hands twisting idly in the air for a moment before a small <em>pop</em> echoed through the room, and Lil Man reappeared in her hands.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I&#39;ve eaten a few breakfasts at Val&#39;s myself.&quot; Cain chirped, silently glad they&#39;d be going somewhere she could top off her flask. That she didn&#39;t cook herself breakfast was easily ascertained from her attempts to make hot chocolate. 

&quot;Do you have a rag bin for your wood staining? Happy to contribute this to the pile. Better to give it a second life doing something meaningful.&quot; Cain was holding her previous shirt. Even before the final tear she&#39;d added last night, it had been positively shredded by the lightning attack she&#39;d levied at the end of the battle with Nyx. The shirt had only been decent due to Cain&#39;s propensity for layers, which also kept the oversized Cha Cha shirt from being a more revealing item on Cain. She&#39;d finished pulling on her other things, and lacked only her shoes before she&#39;d be ready to wander for breakfast snackies.

At the appearance of Lil Man, Cain dramatically laid a hand over her heart. &quot;My favorite acid spitting gentleman, how good of you to join us.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not enough to <em>drown</em> them, but obviously not sized for them. Alas. He could appreciate the way Niamh had tucked it in in a way that made it seemed like it was on purpose, how Cain&#39;s layered nicely with the rest of her clothes. &quot;Not too bad.&quot; he muttered, nodding in approval.

Gingerly he accepted Cain&#39;s old shirt, noticing for the first time properly just <em>how</em> tattered the poor thing was. His brow furrowed halfway through a response, sticking a finger through one of the holes with a sympathetic grimace. &quot;Yeah-<em>yeesh.</em> They really did a number on ya back there, huh. -Ahem. Aye, I can use this, it won&#39;t go to waste.&quot;

He folded the newly designated rag with more reverence than its new designation typically dictated before setting it into a small basket near his woodworking tools for later. That telltale pop from behind earned a soft grin as he turned back around, a hand already reaching out to pat Lil Man on the head. &quot;The wee beastie has rejoined us, eh? Just in time for breakfast, it would seem, but far too late for a shirt. Not that I&#39;ve got anything that&#39;d fit ya.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Niamh just smiled, but rolled her eyes before slinging him over her shoulder and tugging her boots on.
&quot;After yesterday even I&#39;ll admit that he&#39;s earned a nice meal.&quot; Sparing one last glance fondly around the room, she settled by the front door to wait for the other two.
&quot;Shall we?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
