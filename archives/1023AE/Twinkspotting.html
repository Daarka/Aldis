While the words had sounded promising at the time, the truth of the matter was it had been long enough without seeing hide nor hair of Kelnari that Yarrow was convinced he&#39;d entirely skipped town. Not that he blamed him, really. He&#39;d been completely spooked at the initial threats late that night, and Yarrow&#39;s threat had earned so little reaction that he swore he was simply used to cutting his losses and running. A familiar feeling he could relate to, surely, but still disappointing.

Yarrow slouched lazily at one of his favorite haunts at one of the last outside tables of the season. Though they didn&#39;t serve alcohol, the coffee was nice, the food was filling, and it had an excellent view into the main roads of town which made it equally excellent for people-watching. It passed the time and gave him something to do, something to look forward to if anyone interesting showed up. Not that he was looking for anyone in <em>particular</em> at the moment, of course. He wasn&#39;t even technically paying attention at the moment, gaze staring off in a daydream while his fork idly pushed around the remnants of his lunch around the plate.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Waiting for the other shoe to drop, though it never really did.

At least, not yet. He wasn’t so easily convinced.

But while he haunted the edges of town without really submersing himself in it, he still made little forays in to take advantage of what he could of civilization. Today was one such day, where a trip to the library had resulted in the acquisition of two books now lightly held against his chest as he unhurriedly strolled. 

Yarrow might not have been paying much attention, but sooner or later, the familiar figure would likely catch his eye, where Kel had quietly found himself a bench in the shade where he could leaf through the books. 

He wasn’t dressed quite as dolled up as he had been when Yarrow last saw him, but he still looked fashionable in his own way, his attire seeming to carry influences of some cultural thematics that the aasimar wouldn’t recognize. And though he perpetually looked nice, he also looked quite comfy. It was as if the subtle shift in his presentation was simply the absence of a deliberate lure.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161061537574817912 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161061537574817912><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, October 9, 2023 3:04 PM">3:04 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-spoiler chatlog__markdown-spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"> vibes but like in proper Kel colors instead of this teal </span></span></div><div class="chatlog__attachment chatlog__attachment--hidden" onclick=showSpoiler(event,this)><div class=chatlog__attachment-spoiler-caption>SPOILER</div><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1161050337533235210/1161061537344143513/SPOILER_IMG_6193.png?ex=655bd7d1&amp;is=654962d1&amp;hm=a29ebbc065a5df1c27f305bb56e6f8b1051462e44b2e502a78119e2fc9041556&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1161050337533235210/1161061537344143513/SPOILER_IMG_6193.png?ex=655bd7d1&amp;is=654962d1&amp;hm=a29ebbc065a5df1c27f305bb56e6f8b1051462e44b2e502a78119e2fc9041556&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: SPOILER_IMG_6193.png (694.91 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

Draining his coffee and leaving coin to cover the costs, he rose from his seat and began moving his way over at a casual but quiet pace. Though it was broad daylight, he couldn&#39;t deny part of him wasn&#39;t interested to see if he couldn&#39;t get Kel to jump and pull a gun on him again.

His own clothes were more or less the same as always, though he wore Cain&#39;s black shirt under his white one for a bit of warmth. Hey, layers were sexy. So was not freezing your tits off. He either kept a lot of similar clothes, or simply didn&#39;t have many options.

He came in close before speaking up, a hand trailing delicately along the back side of the bench as he leaned in. &quot;Is this seat taken?&quot; he purred, a mischevious squint to his eyes.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Yarrow had successfully snuck up on him with his attention down in the books, and his head quickly snapped up at the voice directed at him. But apart from the little jolt and small, sharp inhale, there was no bristling defensiveness this time. He was, seemingly, back to being a completely different person than the one that had put a pistol under Yarrow&#39;s jaw.

He blinked owlishly a moment, and as recognition set in, he relaxed again, giving the aasimar a muted smile. &quot;It is not. Good to see you again.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Is it really? You flatter me, Kel. I almost feared the opposite y&#39;know.&quot; Yarrow said before his eyes glanced to the pages in Kel&#39;s lap. &quot;What&#39;re you reading?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Some world history,” he responded easily, closing the book. In doing so, Yarrow’s view was traded from walls of text, to a linen-bound cover more clearly showing larger text: <em>A Treatise on the Secret West</em>.

“Wherever I go, accounts of history tend to differ in various ways. I find it interesting to see what different settlements believe. What they agree and disagree on.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Thankfully Kel closed the book, providing him a crumb of context in the title of the book instead. Ah, that made more sense. He hummed thoughtfully as Kel spoke about it and his interests, leaning his head against Kel&#39;s for a moment.

&quot;I see. That sounds...&quot; Boring? Lame? Not interesting? Not quite. Less juicy than he perhaps would have hoped, but.. He could reason there was something interesting between it all for sure. If only it didn&#39;t require reading massive tomes that were thicker than his-

&quot;Sounds philosophical.&quot; he decided, pursing his lips. &quot;I always figured everyone had a little bit of the truth, and just made up whatever the hell they wanted to suit the rest. Find any interesting contradictions?&quot;

It was perhaps a more intellectual question than Yarrow was familiar with asking nowadays, but there was some genuine interest in Kel&#39;s response at least.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“… There are disagreements about the existence of some islands. Those in support of the theory had only firsthand accounts as evidence, and they are few and far between. By which I mean: I’ve found one such account in total. Those who disregard the idea speak of various measures taken to discover the supposed islands, which all seem to indicate they do not exist. A logical mind would believe the latter party.” A beat.

“… The sad thing is that the strongest case made for the island’s existence is how insidiously the firsthand account seems interwoven with the mentality of a colonist. Something about those motivations and priorities and… manners of speech… resonate as far more convincing proof of something existing than any of the author’s deliberate attempts at verifying their own claims.”

The gentle murmur of his words was almost like he was speaking these thoughts to himself, his mind somewhere else in that train of thought. Yarrow’s flirty tones were not made to feel unwelcome, but there was a void on the receiving end upon which nothing playfully bounced back.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Turns out, mysterious islands actually were pretty damn interesting; it was close to rumors he&#39;d heard once or twice in random taverns while drinking with the crew. There was always one sailor who swore on his mum&#39;s tit they&#39;d seen something no one else had. His mind struggled to think of anything that was actually useful or potentially verifiable on the subject, leaving him with a subtle frown.

Still, his interest had been piqued, and long-unused rusty gears turned in his head for the first time in years all the same. &quot;Do they say where these islands are supposed to be?

At least,” he mused, “there was a single, secondary expedition by someone who was not the original claimant. Boots on the ground, if you will, which turned up nothing. Other attempts at verification have come by way of methods like divination, which should have been even more conclusive. And they seemed to conclude nothing but uninterrupted ocean in the region.”

Kel gave a little shrug. “I suppose I would then dismiss it as the original claimant spinning a fantasy. But people are biased in favor of their own creations, even of the mind. You do not dream something up only for it to be the subject of your oppression.” A beat. He squinted slightly.

“You <em>rarely</em> dream something up only for it to be the subject of your oppression. If it’s a fantasy, why specify that the natives had their own language, that you came to understand their words for certain things or the names of places or entities in their culture, only to replace those native words with labels you invented in your own tongue? Why would you find something new, learn what it calls itself, and then discard that title in place of one of your choosing when you attempt to introduce the concept of its existence to others? Why would you invent an entire peoples, only to sneer down your nose at how primitive and uncivilized they are—while simultaneously, seemingly unknowingly describing great accomplishments of theirs that surpass your own civilization? No one spins fantasies like that. It’s… how ignorant people speak of very real things.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Though he&#39;d sailed a decent mount on the eastern side of the world, the west was primarily a mystery to him. His crew didn&#39;t often have need to sail that far, after all, when they had plenty of pickings in the east. Not to say he hadn&#39;t <em>wanted</em> to visit at some point. It simply seemed safer to stay landlocked nowadays than test the waters, as it were.

Still, the idea that someone would make up something as grand as they did, only to sweep it up under their own grand illusion of supremacy... He made a face, pulling away from his nice little cuddle to slouch against the back of the bench. &quot;There is also the chance that the witness is simply a delusional idiot.

Kel did not volunteer any personal theories, half-lidded eyes looking distantly over the cover of the book. &quot;... Both very possible conclusions. I suppose it&#39;s just sad, either way.

An unpainted but well-manicured nail glided along the edge of the book&#39;s cover as he thought. &quot;If it is a real place, such a thing will likely only get worse. If one traveler found it, surely, in time, others will, too. What the author intended to describe as primitive and inferior... there&#39;s simply no getting around how impressive much of it was. How beautiful it sounded. Just... seen through the wrong eyes.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Even if the only accounts there were came from someone who appreciated it for what it was, the assholes would still read them and see profit. They&#39;d be fucked eventually either way.&quot;

&quot;... Not everything <em>should</em> have eyes on it,&quot; he responded after a moment. &quot;If this place exists, it evidently prefers to be hidden. There could be any number of different reasons for that. But it doesn&#39;t matter. Dragging an isolated, insulated culture onto the grid when it doesn&#39;t desire to be connected to the rest of the world isn&#39;t right. Just like walking into a stranger&#39;s house and making yourself at home isn&#39;t right.

A tree of limbs crawled up his subconscious spine and he shivered a little at the memory, shaking his head. His brow furrowed, and a finger idly toyed with his collection of necklaces. &quot;...

He blinked in surprise at the question, though he quickly let out an amused snort and grinned. &quot;Not.. traditionally, no.&quot;

He raised a hand to toy with the vine that always obscured his vision, a physical perpetual reminder. &quot;I&#39;ve never exactly felt like being an aasimar did me any favors, not with my particular patron. You&#39;re familiar with <em>one</em> of his favorite gifts, if you remember. This one&#39;s mostly just cosmetic.

Still. A compliment was a compliment, and Yarrow was loathe to ever turn one down, no matter his feelings on the matter.

He shifted back to a more proper sitting position, leaning in with a lazy hand teasingly poking at Kel&#39;s cheek. &quot;What about you, hm? Where&#39;d you get your lil fangies from huh?

Speaking of drinking, he reached inside his shirt, tugging free a small flask.

&quot;... It was my understanding that death has certain connotations. It sounds like a &#39;dead&#39; god can still talk and act to a fair extent. What is it he wants out of you, then?

The ease in his answers told just how much he&#39;d accepted the reality of his life - as well as how little of it he actually understood. He shrugged a little. &quot;From what I&#39;ve been able to guess, it&#39;s kinda like.. echoes of his influence. Whatever bits of my blood that started as his still remembering who he was, even if all his shrines are gone. I dunno what he wants though, or if it&#39;s just me. For all I know, there&#39;s more unlucky bastards out there with his blood singing in their ears at night.&quot;

He dragged a hand down his face, frowning thoughtfully at the sky. &quot;First time I saw him was in a dream. I was playing in the garden, and dropped my ball. It rolled out the back gate, and when I went to chase it, I saw him standing just outside, in the woods. I don&#39;t remember much else, but after that he started showing up more. Maybe he&#39;d been standing there the whole time in my dreams, waiting for me to look.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Kel&#39;s gaze wandered off to some nondescript point in their surroundings, chewing over that a moment. &quot;I won&#39;t pretend to know the meaning of any of that. And I can&#39;t say I have any self-important insight to offer.&quot; He gave a little shrug.

&quot;But, seeing as I don&#39;t get the impression from you that you&#39;ve been spooked off my presence... I can at least offer you dreamless nights--consistently--should you choose to spend them with me.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He paused a moment to muse. Despite their whole conversation and him practically monologuing, he still pretty much knew the same amount of information about Kel as he did the night they met. Which was to say, not much. &quot;What about you though, do you dream? Anything interesting?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He frowned for a moment. That sensation of brine from earlier certainly had no place in the boar’s wonderland. “If you’re offering to keep secrets about dreams and the like, I wouldn’t look too deeply into any about the ocean.

&quot;Never been one much for the ocean. Even less so for women.&quot; Only a little subtly ironic, given how his presentation teased towards the feminine far more than the average man. &quot;I should be fine, I imagine.&quot;
