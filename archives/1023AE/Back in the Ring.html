It wasn&#39;t turning off the whole thing, but it at least gave him time to adjust to the brighter light. It gave him time to take in the more remote location of this particular ring, as well as note the trees ringing it.

As Cain slipped into the ring, he slipped to the nearest tree to settle in the shade, leaning against the barrier in a casual sprawl, one foot kicked over another ankle. He seemed quite comfortable with his chosen location, eyes solidly focusing on Cain as she settled in to begin.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The library down that way, the college along this path - Fenn Alvy in that back corner but dont let her spook you, and so forth. When they finally turned into the Guild&#39;s expansive grounds, she also pointed out the wooded path to where they&#39;d tucked away Nuala&#39;s treehouse, in case he needed company of the quieter variety.

It wasnt until they turned the corner to their destination that she let her tone shift back into something more playful, spotting Cain taking up position as Yarrow picked a spot in the shade to watch.
&quot;Well, I&#39;ll be damned. I didn&#39;t think we&#39;d be seeing you two on your feet this early.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She steepled her hands in front of her, almost as if she were praying, although she was the furthest from a religious person. Her eyes lifted momentarily at Niamh’ and Meos’ approach and greeting, but her only reply was a hard grin. She wouldn’t mind them seeing this either.

After a moment of centering herself thusly, Cain&#39;s eyes flashed as she entered that cold, hard state that made her a terror in battle. Her movements weren&#39;t quite indicative of any specific martial arts form, but definitely had a smooth, flowing quality to them. As she stepped through her paces, Cain focused her entire attention on her movements and the exercises she was doing, the initial forms meant to stretch and prepare the body for the exertion to come. As her limbs warmed up and her joints loosened, Yarrow (and any other observers) would begin to understand why Cain described this as a dance.

Slowly, almost imperceptibly, she sped up. Her audience would find their eyes drawn almost confusingly away from Cain&#39;s body itself, and more to her shadow as it moved. As Cain spun through her paces faster and faster, the sunlight filtering through the trees around them would begin to catch glints of the blades Cain had stored on her person earlier this morning. The small daggers seemed to glide through the shadows created around her body like a second skin, the sharp blades breathtakingly close to veins, arteries, muscles, sinew. One wrong slip, and the speed with which Cain was moving would surely drive a dagger through a limb entirely… but Cain&#39;s movements, augmented by years of training and that deep, clarion call of battle, hummed with grace and efficiency. Her step was sure, and she moved faster still.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1133806396366921829 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1133806396366921829><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, July 26, 2023 10:01 AM">10:01 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>A large leaf from one of the tallest trees drifted down, battered about as the gentle breeze drifted it towards where Cain was spinning in the center of the field. Her eyes focused on it briefly, and in a blink the leaf was shredded, a tattered ragged thing. The only hint that Cain had attacked was a glint in her eye matched by the gleam of the whirling daggers that were somehow flowing through her shadow like a second skin.

It was almost impossible to distinguish Cain&#39;s body from her shadow, so quickly was she moving. She planted her right heel, and in a kick that somersaulted her entire body, she lept backwards, landing on her heels with a spring. She came back fully visible, the shadows having ceased their encroaching on her physical form. 

In the trees nearest each new visitor to the clearing, one of the daggers formerly flowing around Cain&#39;s body was embedded. She gave a grin that was positively feral as her blood hummed, grinning at Niamh and Meos. “Look at you two, limbs all attached. I take it your reunion went well?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Thankfully he was just in time to witness Cain&#39;s performance from start to finish, taking note of her initial movements. Indeed, he didn&#39;t recognise any that might have been enough to discern a familiar style, but it was enough to impress him regardless. A note was made to talk with her about it later, but then his attention was back to the performance.

It was enough to bring a smile to his face - not the usual lazy smile he greeted the world with, but an honest-to-goodness smile meant for genuine appreciation of what he was just witnessing. He made some subtle preparatory motions of his own, just in case Cain lost control of her spinning daggers, but whistled, impressed, as the falling leaf was shredded. Surely she would&#39;ve been a good fit for those of the Moon sect back home, but that, as well, was a thought best left for later when he had gotten a better idea of what her personality was truly like.

He applauded as her performance ended, and began to speak, &quot;Beautiful display...&quot; Then there was mention of the reunion, and his smile faltered. &quot;Ah... aye, as well as can be expected. There&#39;s plenty still to talk about, but the day&#39;s far too good to spend on ghosts and worries.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Meos&#39;s presence noted, and he gave the man a friendly wave as well. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t think, would you? As it happens, muffins and bearclaws are the perfect way to start the morning after. Or mid-afternoon.&quot; He called out in return before looking back towards Cain with renewed attention.

He still wore his clothes from the day before, sans his loose white shirt which had been instead replaced with a darker, more form-fitting one that clung in a way his usual shirts didn&#39;t. One that looked like it probably fit a bit better on the woman beginning her special warmup.

Though his gaze had started with a sleazy eye, simply admiring the view, the fluidity of her movements picked up speed and the shadows shifted in a way that piqued Yarrow&#39;s curiosity more, attention sharpening more to actually focus on the dance. The way her shadows shifted on their own, the way the daggers teased promises of blood despite Cain&#39;s careful control... Of course she enjoyed a little danger, he noted with a grin. She was built for it.

Instinctively he flinched at the flinging of daggers, letting out a delighted laugh before clapping in applause. <em>&quot;Very</em> well done. I can only imagine how much time it takes to practice something like that.&quot;

His attention slipped back to Niamh and Meos with a raised brow and small smile, not bothering to hid his curiosity as to the outcome of their reunion as well. &quot;Plenty to talk about indeed, I can only imagine. Or did you <em>talk</em> about it instead?&quot; He asked with a wink.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There was a shimmer of sweat on almost every surface of her body, as though the exertion of the previous exercise had been physically and mentally demanding. She grimaced a little, knowing she would feel sore tomorrow, but glad to have not made a mistake in front of an audience. It had been a while since she&#39;d needed to exercise that skill set, and she felt a little rusty. Still, she gave a little bow, grinning at Meos&#39; and Yarrow&#39;s compliments.

&quot;At least two decades,&quot; she called out dryly, in answer to Yarrow&#39;s half-question about how long it had taken her to learn the technique. It was responsible for many of the scars that marked her body, as well. 

She loped across the field, collecting her daggers from the trees where she&#39;d flung the blades and tucking them hidden into her clothes. She joined the other gathered adventurers, flopping down to sit in the shaded grass, listening to the group&#39;s discussion.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Nah, Meos likes to get freaky and resolve his conflicts with other people using his words.&quot;
She popped up to take a seat on the fence as Cain set about collecting her daggers, legs swinging freely as she perched.

Just from what she’d observed when Niamh had first noticed Meos in Ghalasine, Cain was sure the shared history between them must be difficult. She was glad they’d apparently been able to work things out.

Cain shielded her eyes from the sun as she looked up at Niamh, considering the question. “Daily routine, sort of. I don’t usually show off secret techniques,” and here, her expression was coy and it wasn’t clear if she was joking about the shadow technique being a secret, “but I do try and get a good workout of some kind in. Rarely does it happen early, though.” She glanced at Yarrow with a smirk and a wink.

Cain glanced between Meos and Niamh again, curious. “Is that what has you two out this morning? Early meditations?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Meditations for me, to be sure. I&#39;ve my own routine that keeps me from goin&#39; to rust, and more besides. But no, we just went for a run as we talked, I find it helps to clear the head and air that way.&quot; He paused, looking to Niamh and then the two in front of him. If <em>she</em> took him up on the offer, and if really meant to know what the rest of the bunch were like, why not try his luck with them as well? 

&quot;I feel as if I know the answer already, but ye&#39;re more than welcome to join in the mornings, as well. I start early, but have options all the way to noon on some days.

She&#39;d been practicing this longer than he&#39;d been in medicine, he wagered.. and her skill showed for it, as well as the plentiful scars telling years of varying degrees of close calls. Those daggers had moved quite close, after all. He made a mental note to appreciate those scars more next time.

Yarrow let out a small sound as the crumpled wrapper boinked off his head, chuckling to squint with faux disbelief at Niamh. &quot;What, using <em>words?</em> What kinda madman are you, Meos?&quot; he teased, pressing a hand to his chest as he looked to the genasi.

He settled in against the fence, shifting his position to lean on his back, elbows propping him up with his legs stretched before him. All the better to converse with everyone, now that the star of the show had joined them. Or at least listen, letting them talk about morning routines and workouts and the like. He could respect it.. and in another time, he might have had a routine of his own to perk up and mention. But now, he gave Meos a lazy smile, shaking his head. &quot;I usually try not to wake up terribly early if I can help it nowadays. I don&#39;t need clarity anyways, I&#39;m peachy keen right where I am.&quot;

He paused, then shrugged. &quot;Or at least, I&#39;m usually too drunk or hungover to do what, <em>stretches</em> in the morning? Blech. I&#39;d probably throw up on you.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She preferred to live in the moment, perhaps to a fault. Doing so had kept her path interesting, though, and she wasn&#39;t looking to change that.

She glanced back at Meos, her head tilted sideways as she considered the invitation. &quot;I appreciate the offer, but meditation isn&#39;t really my forte. Reminds me too much of the quiet growing up.&quot; Cain&#39;s voice was honest, but soft in tone; she was genuinely grateful for the spirit of Meos offering to share something meaningful to him. She gave a half grin as she continued. &quot;But I would enjoy a run, if you&#39;ve a mind to do it in the later morning or afternoon. I can never convince myself to run alone... I&#39;m not that much of a masochist. But I like going with a buddy or two.&quot; As she finished speaking, she raised an eyebrow and flashed a smile at Niamh as well.

Cain rotated her shoulders, trying to ease her muscles a bit. She leaned back on her elbows, closing her eyes and gracefully stretching her legs out in the grass front of her. She&#39;d almost caught her breath, and the breeze in the shade of the trees felt delicious. After a moment like this, she cracked an eye open in Niamh&#39;s and Meos&#39; direction. &quot;Ok, which one of you wants to go show off? I already had my turn.&quot; Her voice was wry and self-effacing as she teased, but her eyes did gleam at the idea of getting to see new and interesting techniques.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

My offers to the three of ye stand, regardless, so if ye ever <em>do</em> find yerself wakin&#39; up early, or sufferin&#39; from insomnia, my spot&#39;s by the river.&quot; The offer was sincere, though he neglected to say exactly <em>where</em> &#39;by the river&#39; was. At least Niamh knew, and surely she&#39;d tell them. Right?

Looking around the group, Meos gave a thoughtful hum. &quot;Lackin&#39; a river, I can&#39;t do me preferred form of meditation, but I prepared somethin&#39; different, regardless. Give me a minute or so.&quot; Hoping that they would, in fact, give him the time to get what he needed, he wandered off to the nearby trees to get himself some wood. Not too long after, he returned and made his way to the spot in the arena that Cain had made use of.

Once there, he started to stack the wood in the form of a typical campfire. So far, so normal. Once satisfied that it would be enough, he removed the loose shirt he wore and tied it around the remaining wood, then himself, as a makeshift sling to keep it in. In that moment Cain and Yarrow would see what Niamh saw the night before and that morning. From his neck to the small of his back, across shoulders, arms, chest and stomach were inked a myriad of tattoos. Some were fairly intricate designs, spirals of vines, flowers, waves and even serpentine dragons, while others were crude and definitely not as artistic (the least offensive of which was a mermaid straddling an anchor). More than the tattoos, there were scars as well. Slashes, cuts and a scattering of burns chemical and mundane.

He turned back to the group with a sheepish smile. &quot;It&#39;s been some time since I&#39;ve practiced this set, so forgive me if I&#39;m a touch rusty. Since the devil reminded me of Ratagari, I&#39;ve had a mind to do somethin&#39; for her memory. This is a good a time as any.&quot; His piece spoken, he turned and clapped his hands. The wood he prepared all but flared to life as he smiled, bowing to the image of a half-orc woman that took form in the fire and bowed in turn.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1135633439765315584 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1135633439765315584><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, July 31, 2023 11:01 AM">11:01 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Once he moved closer, both Meos and the image of (presumably) Ratagari settled into low stances. Initially the both of them moved with slow, unsure movements. Though he was far from terrible, he had, indeed, not practiced this performance in many months, and it was made all the more precarious by his choice of partner. As he continued, however, the movements settled. They remained slow for now, but the slowness grew to be more meditative than unsure, and the motions of both Meos and the firey image became more fluid. When he struck, she gracefully deflected the blow, and when she struck, he moved along the blow to slide past her, causing the two to become all but entwined before they stepped away.

Then, they flew at each other. The meditative slowness was replaced with a sudden burst of ferocity and speed as Meos launched an offensive flurry of punches to the image&#39;s chest, abdomen, and with a spin, her back. Still, Ratagiri side-stepped with practiced precision, instead launching an offensive of her own that seemed all-too-real in its intensity. The two forms danced and spun around each other, &#39;trading&#39; blows until, with a sudden snap kick to Meos&#39; head, the form of Ratagiri split in two and dissipated. A moment later, the fire reformed into a single entity where the wood had been burning, holding out a hand.

In response, Meos threw the firey half-orc two of the sticks he had secured across his back. The were consumed, as one might expect, to further fuel the fire and the two flew again. This time, Meos and  Ratagiri both had not just blows from their fists, but also kicks to match in the worryingly blistering dance. Where he spun a kick to her head, she ducked and spun at his legs, which he leapt over and attempted to bring a heel down on her head, which she promptly avoided. It was fast, yes, but choreographed and practiced to near-perfection through years of work.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1135633465841303592 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1135633465841303592><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, July 31, 2023 11:01 AM">11:01 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Inevitably, however, the dance had to end. With a final flurry of blows, the firey form dissipated and regenerated once again. Meos and Ratagiri bowed first to each other, then to the audience. Finally, the fire sputtered out and it was done. 

Meos, for his part, was positively <em>beaming</em>. Compared to the lazy, uninterested smile he normally wore, what he now had was as bright as the midday sun. Out of breath, a bit singed, and more than sure that he&#39;d regret it later, he moved back to the group. He had nothing to say in that moment, simply closing his eyes, smiling and regaining his breath as he remembered a departed colleague fondly.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He had to admit, he was certainly curious if either of them had something similarly impressive. While getting to watch Cain had been worth the trip enough as it was, he was never against getting more visual treats for minimal effort.

Meos&#39;s rise to the call earned him a curious, if lazy glance. After having seen the man in action so to speak in Ghalasine, he was curious if he somehow had something else up his sleeves. At the very least, he had nowhere else to be, and so he easily afforded the man time to gather.. kindling? Yarrow quirked a brow but watched him work, flipping back on the fence to properly watch him set up in the middle of the field. His eyes dragged down the exposed scars and tattoos, taking notes for later. For all of his monkly persuasions, he certainly appeared to have led a wildly different life.. a familiar thought, that.

For all the man&#39;s proficiencies with water, he hadn&#39;t expected a blaze, let alone a sparring partner formed from fire. The laziness melted away as the pair moved in their sparring dance, the corner of his lip quirking as he realized just how close to getting singed Meos was with every blow. Despite wanting to tease the man further, he couldn&#39;t deny he was impressed, drawn in fully as the performance exploded into a faster pace. He could scarcely blink lest he miss a swing. After all was finally said and done, he brought his hands together for a slow but purposeful clap, giving the man a grin.

<em>&quot;Very</em> fancy. Didn&#39;t realize you could put on such a pretty show, Meos! Where the hell&#39;d you learn how to do all that?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Hoping that good things would come to those who were patient, she kept her eyes on his preparations while letting her other senses drift. Her ears took in the sound of insects and gentle weather around them, her nose the loamy scent of the training ground earth juxtaposed against the herbal grass she was sitting in. She was alert, though, and keyed her full focus immediately back on Meos as he spoke.

Cain inhaled sharply as a woman formed out of the flames. Cain&#39;s eyes followed the movements of Ratagari and Meos, watching them settle in for <em>something</em>, and the barbarian grinned wolfishly. As they began whirling blows at one another, Cain stood, unable to sit while watching such a talented display. Her eyes sparked as Meos fed the flames, eager for what came next.

Cain shook her head minutely as the fighters somehow managed to increase their intensity yet again. Her eyes could barely follow their movements. Cain knew what it meant to feel a technique ringing in her bones. Cain knew how to read sacrifice in the scars on someone&#39;s body. Cain knew how with enough practice, steps became instinctive, habitual… inevitable. She knew these things in herself, and she recognized them before her now in Meos. She hadn&#39;t expected an answer to her challenge of this caliber, but she was grinning delightedly at Meos&#39; dance.

Cain whistled a low appreciative tone and joined Yarrow in clapping as Meos and Ratagari bowed. Cain met his grin with her own at the showing of authentic happiness from the genasi. <em>Ah</em>, she thought to herself, <em>nice to finally meet you, Meos.</em> 

Cain nodded at Yarrow&#39;s question. &quot;Make that two very curious individuals,&quot; she chimed in, keen to hear where Meos had learned his own dangerous dance.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;A monastery on Sen Rapa,&quot; he began, tapping the mask still hanging on his belt. A crying jester face with two horns. &quot;Can&#39;t say the name&#39;ll do much good for ye in their language, but loosely translated it&#39;s &#39;The House of the Sun and Moon.&#39; Sparin&#39; you the details of our philosophy, it&#39;s them what taught me.&quot; He motioned to the blackened remnants of the fire behind him, and drew a finger glowing with blue-green light across what was still exposed of his tattooed chest. &quot;The dance, the magic, everything. I was a dab hand with poisons and their remedies before meeting with them, but they refined that as well.&quot;

There was a beat, then he added. &quot;Turns out what I used for that knife throwin&#39; contest might&#39;ve ended in more than a brawl if I got the dose wrong. Gods only know if I deserved the luck in gettin&#39; it just right.&quot; If people were going to be sharing their secrets, he might as well give them a little bit more of his own, and what he learnt from the experience.

Though he conveniently left out the &#39;why&#39; of him going from Castra Nica to Sen Rapa in the first place. Some secrets were best left secret.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She thought the group pretty impressive, based on what Meos had demonstrated so far, but wasn’t sure she’d appreciate the philosophy aspect of their training. Her eyes danced with her interest, though, and she made a note to ask him a little bit more about the group on one of their future runs. 

As he mentioned his more alchemical-type trainings, she grinned, interest in the monetary definitely piqued. “I don’t know that I’m a dab hand, but I probably wouldn’t be standing here if I hadn’t made it a habit to carry a few interesting tinctures around. Any place that refines skills in potions and poisons gets my approval. If you ever want to compare notes, I’d be keen to trade recipes.”

Cain moved to perch on the fence next to Yarrow, grimacing a bit as her muscles protested the movement. As she settled, letting her long legs dangle, she listened to Meos speak about luck. Cain looked at the genasi thoughtfully. “If it all worked out in the end, you deserved it.” She thought a moment longer before giving an elegant shrug. She didn&#39;t think it was worth overanalyzing her successes, beyond understanding what she did well to replicate it in the future.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A Monastery? He tried to think if he’d ever been to Sen Rapa - possibly, amidst all the traveling his crew had done, though he couldn’t think of anything that’d kept them very interested for long. <em>Perhaps to Sen Rapa’s benefit,</em> he thought dryly. The multitude of tattoos slipped from view as Meos donned his shirt again, and he briefly wondered if ‘going to the monastery to get better’ would be something that could fix him. He entertained the thought briefly, snorting quietly to himself as it was quickly disregarded. He had no interest in becoming a monk, fancy fire magic or no. At the very least, he could appreciate that whatever it is Meos had done, it clearly had worked for him. For the most part.

As Cain moved to perch on the fence beside him, he shifted an arm around her to sneak back in some casual contact while she spoke regarding the pair’s shared experience with poisons and the like. He remembered the curious bottles she had, though he’d had more important things to do than ask about them the night before. The mention of refining poisons at the monastery earned a raised brow and a slight tilt to the head.

“Does look it worked out for you after all in the end though, yeah… Did they actually teach you how to make  better poisons, or just how to cure em? I’m almost disappointed this is the first time I’m hearing about this, but it’s not exactly like Ghalasine was ripe for poisony bullshit. Can you imagine trying to poison one of those sandy bitches? It’d just go flying right out the side of the castle just like Jaska did.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sometimes the wound is more metaphorical - a town&#39;s misfortune, say - and the cleaning that needs to be done is the... removal of whatever - or <em>whomever</em> is causing said misfortune.&quot; 

He looked back to the two, finally nodding. &quot;Aye, they taught me how to make better poisons as well as how to treat them, and more than enough of the monks know enough about disease and the like to make their own. It&#39;s not ideal, or what we hope for, but sometimes the only language a greedy, corrupt sod understands is burnin&#39; up from the inside and out.&quot; He tapped the mask again. &quot;That&#39;s one of the times we wear these while working.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Cain listened avidly to Yarrow’s question, snorting at the memory. Although, she admitted internally, the disappearing building was much funnier in reflection. The reality of the experience had been alarming, to say the least.

Cain tilted her head, taking in Meos’ reply with a contemplative look on her face. “That&#39;s a language in which I&#39;m well versed.&quot; Her blithe tone indicated how little she cared about admitting such a thing. Her sharp, intelligent eyes focused on the mask swinging from Meos’s waist, fully taking it for the first time. She raised an eyebrow.
