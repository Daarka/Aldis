He was still <a href="&lt;https://i.gyazo.com/cfe35fbf361eb937448be6f38090274d.png&gt;">dressed</a> comfortably, though perhaps it was starting to get just a <em>little</em> too cold for his usual wardrobe. But he didn&#39;t look particularly preoccupied with that train of thought at the moment, barely feeling the faint breeze chill against the places his clothes didn&#39;t sit snugly against his skin.

He found himself walking through the streets feeling like he should have a hood up. He did not, technically, have any reason to be hiding--but he <em>wanted</em> to. Some instinctive part of him would have felt safer in some manner of obscurity. Maybe that&#39;s why he was sticking to the shadows where he could find them, even though it was mid-morning. 

His hands stuffed in his pockets, he found his gaze prying through his surroundings as he passed by. He was walking with purpose; not just strolling for the sake of fresh air. He was seeking. And, evidently, was set on walking up and down every street in the damn town if he had to.

It didn&#39;t take him terribly long to find what he was looking for, fortunate in that his quarry wasn&#39;t but a few minutes&#39; walk from the guild hall, in the thriving center of town. Achoris was hard to miss in a crowd, so without a crowd present, he stuck out all the more prominently.

Kel stopped on a dime as he saw him, before adjusting his direction and... more slowly approaching him. His face was mostly empty, but... ever so slightly strained. The usual, well-manicured mask he kept his less-intentional emotions behind wasn&#39;t doing its job as well as it had before--though it still put up a valiant effort towards keeping the shaken stress subdued. It didn&#39;t help that his eyes were faintly reddened and bloodshot. 

&quot;... Hey,&quot; he offered softly, his voice similarly a little more subdued than usual. &quot;What&#39;re you up to...?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He <em>wanted</em> to. But ever fiber of his being was telling him to just... <em>disappear</em>. Things were getting too precarious. Come back in twenty years and give the town another shot then.

But he knew that wasn&#39;t the most logical solution. There were more things making a good argument for him to linger than he was used to contending with.

He didn&#39;t look at Achoris, his gaze now solidly on the ground since he had found what he was looking for. A hand slowly raked fingers through his hair. &quot;... In for a copper, in for a gold. Right?&quot;

It was spoken with the desperation of someone who was, frankly, doing an immense amount of mental gymnastics to justify caving to the emotional needs that had only ever caused problems for himself.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;... Yarrow went on that guild mission yesterday. Came home the same evening. He&#39;s... been letting me stay with him, actually... <em>appreciates</em> my company overnight.&quot; It wasn&#39;t spoken as a jab towards Achoris, whose dreams were off-limits to him; it was spoken plainly baffled that anyone could actually know what he was up to and explicitly <em>desire</em> it. &quot;So I was there when he got back. He looked like shit, said he didn&#39;t want to talk about the mission, fell asleep almost immediately. This morning he felt better and said he actually wanted my thoughts on the mission.&quot;

His words were quiet; even with the streets largely empty as they walked, it would have been almost impossible for the rare passerby to make out his words. It was almost a strain for <em>Achoris</em> to catch them.

&quot;He then proceeded to explain that he had been tasked with rescuing the man who had funded an expedition back to my homeland. Which--foreigners aren&#39;t supposed to be able to access. Where he I guess killed some of us and... stole probably our most important artifact.&quot; 

His voice was schooled into something stony and empty. It had to be, because he didn&#39;t want to burst into tears again. Horrors to process later, maybe. More likely, just shove them aside and try to proceed without acknowledging them directly. Forever.

&quot;Which Yarrow&#39;s friends have now. And he... went to talk to them. After I told him what everything actually was. Because... the invaders had some journal that his group found and was reading through. And the author was thoroughly convinced Kalashtar--which he fucking... took it upon himself to rename as <em>dreamkin</em>--are... insidious, parasitic, soul-stealing alien monster things.&quot; A beat. &quot;... I asked if that&#39;s what the rest of his group thought I was. He said maybe.&quot; Another beat, and his final statement was notably weaker.

&quot;I don&#39;t know what to do.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She was also outfitted in a brand new <a href="&lt;https://sites.create-cdn.net/siteimages/1/8/3/18343/18/0/6/18066618/1000x800.jpg?1581964278&gt;">coat</a> that looked to be a horse blanket that had been modified to fit her sleek body, and also have a turtleneck-type extension for her long neck.

&quot;Kelnari, this is Anouke. Anouke, can you keep my friend company for a moment while I pop in and pay for your new coat?&quot;

The hound let out the softest of boofs, and turned her warm brown eyes on to Kel, studying him curiously with a regal and dignified air.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

What had probably been assumed to have been a horse&#39;s tack set over the edge of the fence turned out to actually belong to the dog, as Achoris saddled her up and fit her bridle over her head.

He didn&#39;t want to grab at the dog&#39;s fur, so his grip stayed a little awkwardly between the saddle itself and Achoris&#39; arm. But as Anouke took off, there was only a brief moment of adjusting his balance, before he seemed to find his seat in her stride, the speed of it almost lurching his heart up into his throat. It wasn&#39;t often his body was hurled through space at this speed, and it immediately had his pulse thrumming. 

But he kept his balance well enough, though the wind pushing his hair back from his face for once also made it a bit impractical to chat. So he kept quiet, focusing on not making an ass of himself by getting launched from the saddle. But that had the pleasant, albeit transient side effect of making it very hard for him to worry about anything else for the time being.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Kel could have probably handled an emergency dismount without hurting himself too much. He had no such confidence regarding being suddenly airborne. With a slight, involuntary yelp, he quickly readjusted his positioning so he was more securely grabbing onto the aasimar dragging him to higher altitudes--and despite everything, despite how friendly Achoris had been (all things considered), there was still a part of Kelnari that wondered if this was his creative endeavor of problem-solving. Just dash the little idiot on the ground from some nauseating height. Very little Kel would be able to do to fight back against that kind of assault. He had his tricks, but not many things to save him from that manner of death.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Kel still said nothing, though he listened to Achoris&#39; words. He looked over the land beneath them, both dizzying in the lack of solid ground within reach, and somewhere between breathtaking and giddying in its novelty.

It was hard to tell exactly where his mind was at, especially without Achoris having a view of his face. But after a while, his voice returned, the proximity to Achoris&#39; face the only way the other man would have heard him, with the wind buffeting them both.

&quot;... I&#39;ve... always wanted to ask for this favor. But never... really had anyone I <em>could</em> ask it to,&quot; he murmured after that pause. &quot;And it may not be something you can do. Maybe you&#39;re just not present for it. You aren&#39;t obligated, but... if you&#39;re still in my life whenever I die, can you please ensure my body is destroyed before the first nightfall following it?&quot; A beat. &quot;Preferably reduced to ashes.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I am curious as to why the stipulation on the time frame, but also it makes no difference to me whether or not you decide to share.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He took a moment to respond, but ultimately seemed to conclude Achoris knew plenty of damning information about him already, and another little detail would be lost in the pile of the rest.

&quot;... I could be wrong. But I just... have good reason to suspect that I won&#39;t... really stay dead. And... whatever rises with my body won&#39;t be me, and would be... extremely dangerous to everyone I died around.&quot;

The words were soft. He found himself gently leaning back against Achoris&#39; body as Anouke wandered about, some subconscious part of him drinking in the physical comfort of amicable touch. &quot;... I&#39;ve never wanted to hurt anyone,&quot; he went on a moment later, even quieter. &quot;... No god made me in their image, though. I... envy you. I wish I could feel perfect like that.&quot; The more he spoke, the fainter his words became, barely even audible towards the end.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I spent too long thinking I had fallen from His grace and harboring a little resentful and hurt voice in me that told me every bad thing that happened to me was my own fault. But that&#39;s the thing about perfection - its definition is different for everyone. Some say it is to be without flaw, and others say it&#39;s the flaws that give value and character that they find perfect.&quot;

Hunching forward a bit, he let his chin rest atop Kel&#39;s head, gazing off across the fields. &quot;I could go on and say that there&#39;s someone in the world who finds you perfect, but that means very little in the scheme of things. If there&#39;s anything I&#39;ve learned, is that the favor and opinions of other people are fickle and changeable, and ultimately don&#39;t matter. What matters is learning to accept yourself for everything you are. Not to see yourself as perfect, but to see yourself in truth. To accept those things about yourself you can&#39;t change, and to work on changing things you can.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

You sound like Nari,&quot; he murmured. Though it didn&#39;t sound like an insult. &quot;She&#39;s... had her work cut out for her, trying to find silver lining over the last... century and a quarter or so.&quot;

Drawing in a deep breath, he let out a long sigh. &quot;... I try, though. I think... I might actually have gotten decent at it, if the inner voice was the only one speaking. I&#39;ve... had nothing but time to work on... handling my own emotions. It really throws a wrench in the gears, though, when... everyone you ever get even a little bit close to just... it all ends the same way.&quot;

He was silent a moment, before huffing a faint snort. &quot;... A hundred and twenty-some years or whatever, and you and Yarrow are still the first to shrug it off. To <em>consent</em> in any capacity.&quot; A beat. &quot;... He also threatened to kill me like fifteen minutes later. So I guess it&#39;s not completely foreign.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
