Which was unusual only in that it <em>wasn&#39;t</em> approaching a full moon, that there was in fact another week left before it came, but Kaleva&#39;s appetite (for meat in particular) had nearly doubled, and he was constantly busying himself with something or other. There was also an uptick in his more <em>canine</em> tendencies... Tilting his head at sounds to catch them better, sniffing things, baring his teeth or growling audibly at the dogs. His patience with the huskies was rather short as well.

Kaleva had gone off on a hunt, and as luck would have it, his quarry came bounding out of the woods and straight through the front yard, the tiefling in wolf form hot on its tail followed by the huskies. With a burst of speed he snapped out and bit into a hind leg, strong jaws breaking the bone as the doe bleated and crashed to the ground. He was quick to overtake it, to grab onto its flailing neck and clamp down with a growl, strangling it to death while the huskies worried at its haunches.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Once or twice, she had spoken up when he raised his lip at the dogs; usually his methods with them went unquestioned by her, but when it started to feel a little excessive, she had offered a gentle word to try to diffuse things. But she didn&#39;t exactly find herself <em>worried</em>. At least not at the moment, though her attention had gradually become fixated on his shift in mood, to the point where no little deviation from his usual character was missed anymore. 

She had been inside doing some spring cleaning when she heard the commotion in the yard, and set down what she was doing to head outside and make sure everything was okay. She wasn&#39;t usually privy to the hunting process, simply by virtue of not being able to effectively join Kaleva, but she also wasn&#39;t put off by it; nature do be like that, and she had a healthy appreciation for the natural relation of predators and prey. 

Still, seeing as she usually did not get to witness these things, she found herself lingering outside, keeping an eye on things to ensure a stray kick from the doe didn&#39;t hurt the dogs. Even at the best of times (outside of this present moodiness), she was aware that Kaleva sometimes acted impulsively when fully shifted into a wolf, given the wrong stimuli, and so she kept a fair distance from the scene so as not to crowd him while he did his thing.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The huskies backed off, and Kaleva went to start worrying at the stomach, to tear it open and pull out the fawn within.

The smell and sight was enough for the huskies to creep forward with placating whimpers, crawling low to the ground, but Kaleva spun on them with a roar and a snap of his teeth, sending them both skittering away with tails tucked to huddle next to Skena for comfort, left to watch as the werewolf ravenously devoured the fawn.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Well, for all she knew, this was a normal thing he did. She simply was not with him in most of these instances. She made a mental note to ask him about it later (his mouth was currently a bit full), stooping down to consolingly rub the dogs&#39; ears, murmuring a gentle command to them to sit down so they could start to settle, following it up with quiet reassurances. 

Once she felt reasonably confident she had offered them a bit of comfort, she glanced back up to watch Kaleva eat, squinting a little in thought. Maybe it was like veal, and the fetus was just more delicious.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Even without him having thumbs, she wasn&#39;t hard to push around, given how little she weighed and that she wasn&#39;t actively fighting against him. The blush had set in over her complexion rather deeply, and her gaze raked through the treeline a bit nervously as she felt him grind against her. If someone like Ludin wandered by and saw this... she&#39;d probably just have a heart attack and die on the spot. 

But the alternative was trying to convince Kaleva to take things inside, and... she didn&#39;t really feel like cleaning fetus bits off the bedsheets, either. 

It had begun to get warm enough that some of her usual wardrobe was coming back, and today, that meant a plain but cute pink sundress that went down to about her shins. She grit her teeth, not seeing anything concerning beyond the trees through the tangled strands of hair that had unceremoniously fallen over her eyes, but also not entirely soothed by how disadvantaged she currently was to be keeping an eye out, with an animal two or three times her size smothering her. 

&quot;... I-If someone shows up, you&#39;ve gotta stop, alright?&quot; She managed, reaching to grasp her fingers into the fur of his cheek, as if to grab at his attention and make him hear her. &quot;Please? Acknowledge that somehow?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Humping over her back in short, quick little motions, his cock sought her sex, the slick and tapered tip pressing up against her thighs and backside, poking and prodding about. But without proper hands to really guide things into place, it took him some moments of shifting about and adjusting his position before he finally felt the warmth and wetness of her folds, and his hips surged forward to bury the slender length of him inside her. 

He pounded into her in rapid thrusts, nearly squashing her into the ground with the force of it, his knot rapidly swelling up, though he hadn&#39;t quite managed to lodge it inside of her in the initial surge of movement. Instead, it slapped against her entrance while his panting maw gusted hot breath over her head.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The heat that had blotted over her face was matched by that between her legs, and she sincerely hoped some part of Kaleva was still trying to at least keep a <em>bit</em> of an eye out for visitors, as she rapidly became unable to do so herself. Her arms had buckled to land her down on her elbows in the grass, her hair tousled over her face as she gave quiet, strangled little noises under him, her breaths reduced to short gasps. 

Of course it felt good. It was Kaleva; her enjoying herself in some capacity was inevitable. As he fell into a rhythm, the lingering anxiety she had over being seen like this quickly became drowned out by the dominating stimuli, until her mind was practically vacated. She had very little to grab onto with their positioning, but eventually one hand found that tuft of fur on his cheek again behind her head, a mindless gesture in some effort to stabilize herself as her body was quickly overwhelmed.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The first was the rapidity in which he could drive himself into her. His furred thighs splayed as he mashed himself against her, his spine bowed, claws digging into the material of her dress at her waist. The second was the amount of fluid, and that it did not result from a singular moment of climax, but started spurting into her almost immediately, and gushed out of her without his knot inserted to keep it from escaping, down her thighs and into the grass below. The third was that... it was over in about forty seconds, one forelimb dropping to brace his upper body as his thrusts slowed to a stop,  his panting chest pressed into her back, his chin draped down over her shoulder.

Though if other canines were anything to go by, he&#39;d probably be ready to go again soon. But for the moment he caught his breath, his wolven cock flexing inside of her as it continued to let out smaller spurts of semen, lost to the aching pleasure and relief of release.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His tongue lolled out of his mouth and onto the ground, seeming kind of... dazed, for lack of a better word.

But he could only hold his forms for an hour, and he&#39;d already been out hunting for a while before he&#39;d returned here. He didn&#39;t know how long he had left, but he felt his grip on the form getting a bit tenuous, as it usually did when he had just minutes left. And after having hunted, killed, eaten, and fucked all in that short span of time, he was finally feeling rather spent. Enough at least to drag his higher brain functions out from underneath the instincts, to let his form fall away so he laid there, naked and panting in the dirt.

Reaching up and running a hand over his bloodied face, he looked at his hand and then at Skena, seeming a bit bewildered. &quot;...Shit, I&#39;m sorry, I... I made a complete mess of you. My god. Are you okay?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She settled back into a seated position as he got off of her, awkwardly pushing her dress partway back down, at least enough to be modest. She still was paranoid some visitor was going to pop up from the forest.
