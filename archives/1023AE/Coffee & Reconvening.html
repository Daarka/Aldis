A warm, safe bed, the comfort of his closest loved ones nearby, a listening ear for whatever he wanted off his chest, and unconditional love and patience for that which he did not have the capacity to divulge. 

And as the cherry on top... Val had her own ways of keeping the nightmares away. If any dreams found Jaska that night, they were inoffensive ones. She made sure of it.

When morning came, she let him sleep in as long as he needed, and when he did wake up, it wasn&#39;t too hard to convince him to follow her down to the tavern so she could feed him more extravagantly than her living space offered. She didn&#39;t need his physical guidance around her own establishment, but her hand was loosely curled around his arm as they descended the stairs anyways. 

As he settled in at the bar, she habitually slipped behind it, telepathically placing an order for a plate of the kind of warm comforts she knew he&#39;d appreciate, and going about pouring him a cup of coffee as they waited for it to be brought out. All the while, of course, Axa sat curled up on his lap, highly disinclined to part from his side.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He probably managed two, maybe three hours, and it showed in the dark circles under his eyes and the way he hadn&#39;t bothered to slick back and tame his curls, which hung in a mousy nest of sleep tousled disarray. He was also clearly borrowing one of her night shirts, a pastel blue cottony thing that hung off him like a tent without the boobage to fill it out.

It gave him the overall appearance of someone much softer, and it was such a drastic difference that if not for his distinctive eyes, he might be unrecognizable.

&quot;I shouldn&#39;t have tried sleeping,&quot; he muttered drowsily. &quot;Feels worse than not having slept at all.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I don&#39;t know how you plan to keep doing the longer ones, you&#39;re always wrecked when you get back.&quot; Her words weren&#39;t scolding or judgmental, just a soft note of concern in her nearly maternal manner.

&quot;Maybe it will help to be going out with groups you&#39;ve built up trust with? But at any rate, you can try for a nap later today. I can probably brew you up some tea that might help, as well.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There was some sort of poetry in Val&#39;s question about individuals Jaska trusted, considering Yarrow was statistically not the best at appearing as such. Whether he <em>actually</em> was after the adventure they&#39;d had at the Manor, well.. that was on Jaska to decide.

Yarrow blinked in momentary surprise before grinning, giving a little wave on his way over to the pair. &quot;Must be my lucky morning.&quot; He said.

Despite the playful lilt to his words, he looked... less bullshitty than usual. A combination of the day&#39;s events and the following morning&#39;s revelations had left him with far less of his usual banter to play with outside that which he did instinctively at this point. He slid into the seat beside Jaska, bumping a knuckle on Jaska&#39;s shoulderblade in a friendly but primarily contact-less greeting.

&quot;Val, I know it&#39;s early, but I could use a double of whiskey.&quot; He said, settling against the bar. At least for the sibling&#39;s benefits, he was less abrasive today, voice gentler than normal.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Easy to miss. But perhaps a degree of more appreciation or gratitude than Yarrow had ever warranted before upon walking into her tavern. Just a hint of more warmth, none of that stranger, more eerie edge to her demeanor that he may have glimpsed when he had set his sights on Luka in her presence.

If she hadn&#39;t been there to support and protect her baby brother, those who went out of their way to do so certainly earned that earnest warmth from her.

&quot;I&#39;m not in the business of judging,&quot; Val replied easily, pushing Jaska&#39;s coffee across the bartop to him before going to fish out the whiskey. &quot;And in case you were worried, your friends didn&#39;t rack up much of a debt on your tab. Mostly just finished off their drinks and departed.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He hummed curiously as the tab came out shorter than expected. That was promising, surely. &quot;Did they now? That was rather kind of them.&quot; He mused, as though their limited drinking was at all affected by their worry for his purse.

His gaze slid back to Jaska for a moment, noting the significantly less put-together appearance than normal. Messy hair, a shirt that very clearly wasn&#39;t his, and eyebags that put Yarrow&#39;s to shame. Actually, Yarrow&#39;s eyebags couldn&#39;t have looked better lately, considering he was actually getting sleep. Raising both his drink and a brow, he gestured vaguely at Jaska, opting instead to reply instead of stating the obvious <em>nice shirt</em> he desperately wanted to say.
&quot;Thanks. Nice of him to spend all his spells on us like that. Might be worthwhile to just hang out here for a while until then... Althought, have you seen Cain or Niamh yet?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As though the conversation summoned him, in through the door Luka came, shouldering it open while carrying a box with all the identified items - now bearing neatly penned descriptions on parchment wrapped around each piece. He also looked perfectly well rested and put together, his curly sunset hair in a loose ponytail at his nape and wearing a loose white poet shirt tucked into snug pinstripe brown pants. &quot;Good morning, everyone!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Still, it&#39;s worth sleeping on it. Devils are not in the business of charity; I think we can all agree he would be endeavoring to get something out of this arrangement.

He vaguely remembered Achoris mentioning something bad had recently blown over, but hadn&#39;t quite realized this trio had also been involved. What a juicy realization.

As Luka made clear his intentions to leave, he reached out to give his wrist a little squeeze, thumb giving him a small stroke. &quot;Listen, thanks again for all of this. Just let me know when you wanna go out and I&#39;m there, alright?&quot;

His attention returned to his little collection, raising the necklace first. &quot;Well, this thing&#39;s pretty, but I can&#39;t use it at all. I don&#39;t have the kind of magic it works with... I don&#39;t for the beads either, but at least those&#39;re still useful in a pinch.&quot;

Did he have other things? Yes. Was he as interested in the doorknob as he was the &quot;necklaces?&quot; No. The book was safely tucked away, it&#39;s purpose already known.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lil Man&#39;s cheerful chattering and scampering between each of their shoulders was no small source of entertainment. Each time he popped over to her, Cain fished out some trail mix that she still had on her person from their travels and covertly fed him some nuts. 

The sun seemed to be playing hide and seek behind a motley cover of clouds; each time its rays came through unfettered, Cain groaned and shielded her eyes. Her hangover promised to be epic, if she didn&#39;t fix it with caffeine and more alcohol. As they drew closer, and the door to the Inn was in sight, Cain&#39;s footsteps hastened. She was eager for drinks and food, but also to see with her own eyes that Jaska and Yarrow were ok. She pursed her lips, mildly annoyed at how needy she felt in the stark light of day, hoping it was a side effect of terror that would ease off with time.

A noticeable amount of tension left Cain&#39;s shoulders as they entered the establishment and found Jaska and Yarrow waiting, along with another tiefling she hadn&#39;t met, but who was obviously the other sibling of Val and Jaska who Cain had heard much about. She took in Jaska&#39;s appearance first, noting with a snort that she and Niamh weren&#39;t the only clothing thieves this morning. Cain herself was dressed in what was noticeably one of Cha Cha&#39;s shirts, which on her looked rather like a tunic. It had threatened to slide off one of her shoulders on the walk, exposing her tank top that she wore underneath. Her black leggings and leather boots completed her ensemble. She booked it over to the bar.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1169713967623573614 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1169713967623573614><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, November 2, 2023 12:05 PM">12:05 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;I&#39;d love a coffee, and if you could top this up with the same 18 year that you recommended last time...?&quot; Cain slid her open flask across the bar to Val, desperate for both drinks. She clearly needed it, and anyone would notice without expending any effort that Cain slept rather poorly. The dark circles under her eyes rivaled Jaska&#39;s, and she&#39;d woken multiple times throughout the night in a cold sweat. Her hair was mused, both from lack of care to brush the sleep out of it, and also Lil Man&#39;s artistic stylings on the walk over.

Most pressing needs tended too, Cain turned to the other two members of their trauma bond, not bothering to hide her relief at being reunited. She laid a light hand on Jaska&#39;s forearm, giving him an affectionate squeeze before turning to Yarrow and throwing her arms around his shoulders in a lingering full body hug. &quot;It&#39;s good to see you both.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As for the medallion, you could probably sell it to one of the sorcerers or shops in town... I don&#39;t know of many, but I know you enjoy Mahva&#39;s company. You could probably work something out with him, if nothing else.&quot;

He paused at the arrival of the rest of the asshole trauma squad, offering them a warm smile. Jaska looked up at Cain and offered a returning hum of greeting, seeming to not mind her touch at all. 

&quot;You&#39;ll find all your items here, each with a written explanation of the items&#39; magical properties,&quot; Luka explained to the newcomers. &quot;If you have any questions, please don&#39;t hesitate to ask. My name is Luka.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And then walked a good portion of the way there continuing to do so, curling her arms into Cain and Cha Cha&#39;s and blindly following them along. This would have lent a boon to Lil Man&#39;s snack sneaking if he did not immediately start crunching down on the nuts the moment they were in his grubby little paws, big round eyes blinking dramatically with the effort. Niamh was at least good enough not to call him out for it, though she did crack a grin and peek over at him to watch.

As the inn came into view she finally stood straight again, blinking and squinting as her eyes adjusted to normal levels. She did not have the same hustle that Cain did, instead moseying in and surveying the room. Everyone accounted for - and then some. She flashed a broad smile at Val, who&#39;d always been receptive somehow in spite of the blindness, and gave Cha Cha&#39;s arm a tight squeeze before stepping towards the siblings and the unfamiliar tiefling as he introduced himself.  Like Cain she was also dressed in one of Cha Cha&#39; s shirts, but had managed to tuck and tie it in a way that it looked deliberate - with a deep v-neck intended for a much broader person tucked into the raised waistband of her usual pants, and the sleeves that on her were billowing, she looked the part of a poet. Or a pirate. With the waves of her hair pushed back and not in its usual braided styles, the visual certainly lent itself towards the latter.  
As she passed Jaska she gave his shoulder a gentle rub, and pressed a kiss on the top of Yarrow&#39;s head - quickly followed by a flick on his ear.
&quot;Good morning you two,&quot; she muttered, clear relief in her tone at seeing them still in one piece. Her pace didn&#39;t stop though, until she stood in front of Luka with a warm smile.
&quot;I should have known youd be as pretty as your siblings - a pleasure to meet you Luka, I love your hair.&quot; Sparing a glance at the box of goodies he brought back, she gave his arm a squeeze with a grateful look in her eye.
&quot;Thank you for taking care of all these, we owe you.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The sun was bright and he hadn&#39;t slept through the night, but it had been a well-worthy sacrifice. While Cain snuck Lil Man snacks and Niamh gave him a grinning pass, Cha Cha found amusement in muttered &quot;Mr. Lil Man&quot; &#39;s and &quot;Ya keep that up, and I won&#39;t be able to call ya a <em>wee</em> beastie anymore&quot; &#39;s sent his way. Along with little scritches just in case his teeny head thought anything of it. Or anything at all, really.

He moved to hold the door open for the pair, allowing them easy entry in as he glanced around. Despite not being there, he too let out a sigh of relief as the missing pair were already awake and present - though Jaska&#39;s shirt raised a brow and a subtle tilt of his head. <em>Huh.</em>

Yarrow nodded as Luka spoke, similarly saddened that for all the fancy grandeur the room provided, it did only last an hour. The more he thought about it though, an hour was usually enough time for more than a few things he enjoyed... Or, y&#39;know, could be used for boring but probably important things as well. The idea to sell the medallion earned the quickest grimace (SeLl his NecKLaCe???) before being smoothed over with the idea of Mahva. It was worth a shot, if nothing else. He split a grin Luka&#39;s way. &quot;Look at you, clever man. That&#39;s not a bad idea if I ever tire of wearing it.&quot;

He turned as the door opened, and though he&#39;d been smiling and grinning all morning in instinct, it brightened all the more when the two walked in - only to dip into brief confusion at their new shirts - and then <em>immediately</em> dipped into deviousness as Cha Cha walked in behind them. He threw his arms wide open as Cain moved in for a hug, immediately nuzzling his head in to presses to her cheek. &quot;Look at you! Gooood morning, ladies~ Cha Cha, lovely of you to take <em>good</em> care of them for me last night, I&#39;m in your debt.&quot;

While Cha Cha blinked as gears began spinning with a <em>how did he know</em> sort of expression, Yarrow loosened an arm to wrap around Niamh to draw her in so he could smother her in kisses as well.

The gears caught as Cha Cha realized Yarrow did <em>not</em> know, finally making the connection between the trio&#39;s incredibly touchy reunion and his shirts nearly hanging off their shoulders. His cheeks immediately darkened as he sputtered out a retort to defend his innocence. &quot;I just did what anyone would- I just fed them and gave them a safe place to sleep, same as, same as anyone!&quot;

Yarrow didn&#39;t need to know about the cuddles.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Cain had been increasingly touchy with him and Yarrow was just Yarrow, but Niamh had always seemed reserved toward him up to that point. He squinted at her in slight confusion, but didn&#39;t seem to object much otherwise.

Luka&#39;s gentle features colored with a bit of warmth as he smiled shyly at the compliment. &quot;Thank you, it&#39;s wonderful to meet you all. And please, think nothing of it, I&#39;m glad I could help. As I was telling Yarrow earlier, I wanted to offer my services to you three if you had need. I run a massage parlor, the Healing Touch over near the marketplace. I&#39;d be happy to gift you a free session... It sounds as though the lot of you could use it.&quot;

Hard to believe he and Jaska were not just siblings, but that they&#39;d shared Luka&#39;s body not so long ago. They couldn&#39;t be more different.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She unwound her arms from around Yarrow before lightly thwacking him on the head. &quot;That&#39;s for wandering off to meet a semi-unknown quantity without backup. And be nice, Cha Cha was a perfect gentleman,&quot; she teased, although her voice held a note of warning as she defended her new friend. She caught Cha Cha&#39;s eye for a moment, allowing her unfettered gratitude to seep into her expression before she covered her genuine emotion with a roguish wink. She seemed to be guarding the cuddle time close to her heart as well. Cain wasn&#39;t so cross as to remove herself from Yarrow&#39;s affections, although she did rather flagrantly pinch some of his whiskey to add to her mug while she waited on her flask refill.

Cain sipped on the drink quietly, listening to the discussion ebb and flow around her. As Niamh introduced herself to Luka, Cain nodded her own head in greeting. &quot;Jaska mentioned you&#39;d Identify all this stuff; it was quite a haul, so a lot of spell-work to go alongside it. Thank you.&quot; Her words were earnest, and she adopted a soft smile. &quot;If Yarrow&#39;s review is to be believed, you give the best massage in town. I&#39;ll gladly take you up on that offer, and probably more paying sessions after that.

She allowed the shirt-formerly-owned-by-Cha-Cha to finish slipping off her shoulder down to her bicep, revealing her tank top with thin straps and a wide, silvered scar that decorated her armpit and arced towards her collarbone.

&quot;An old guild-mate about chopped my arm off.&quot; She spoke blithely; for all the bluntness of the statement, Cain&#39;s tone would have fit more with someone idly talking about the weather.  It wouldn&#39;t be a stretch for Yarrow, Niamh, and Jaska (and probably Cha Cha if he connected enough of her scattered statements from last night) to intuit that she spoke of Nyx. &quot;I&#39;m sure the whole shoulder&#39;s a mess, though the front of it took the worst damage.

How&#39;s your strength in this arm compared to the other one?&quot; There was no oogling, no inappropriate touch or groping, his gaze slightly unfocused with concentration as he tuned into what he was feeling more than what he was seeing.

Alright, he deserved that. &quot;Hey, I <em>am</em> being nice!&quot; He said, giving her a little squeeze.

He was content enough to let her go as the topics of massage came up, nodding. &quot;Luka&#39;s a fuckin godsend with his hands,&quot; he purred in wholehearted endorsement, leaning back eagerly to Niamh&#39;s side. He took the little bite in stride, especially as it was followed by a kiss, and his hand moved to cup and stroke her cheek in response.

Cha Cha&#39;s noises died down as Niamh suggested he get <em>his</em> scars looked at as well. &quot;Ach, that&#39;s not- I mean, I&#39;m fine, mine don&#39;t really bother me.&quot;

He took a few steps closer to the group so that he wasn&#39;t just standing all by his lonesome, though he wasn&#39;t quite sure <em>where</em> to stand. He settled for standing near Niamh, giving Jaska and Val a quiet &quot;G&#39;morning,&quot; that was quickly followed by another quiet &quot;-oh, G&#39;morning to ya too, Axa.&quot;

At least he didn&#39;t try patting her on the head this time. His attention turned back to Luka&#39;s attention on Cain&#39;s scar, which he was seeing for the first time as well. He grimaced at how gnarly it looked, letting out a small whistle as he rolled his shoulder in sympathy. &quot;Yer lucky ya kept the arm.&quot;

&quot;We all are.&quot; Yarrow piped up with a grin and a wag of his brows.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her gaze held a spark of intent in it though, as she glanced at his face and into the box of Luka&#39;s laboriously identified goodies. They&#39;d need to get into the nitty gritty soon - but that could wait until they had food in their bellies. A mischievous grin slipped onto her face as Cha Cha started walking over, and she muttered to Yarrow under her breath.
&quot;Told Cain n&#39; Cha Cha we&#39;d teach &#39;em the basics of sailing. I&#39;m thinking a schooner would be a good size for this little venture, but we need more&#39;n just the four of us,&quot; came the brief synopsis of their late night chat, and the ultimate conclusion. She snaked an arm around Cha Cha&#39;s once he was stood beside her, greedily collecting affection. 
&quot;Not the scars, those are fine-ish. Probably. You dont stretch near often enough - and look at how efficient Luka is, doing an assessment on a dime.&quot;

With the proximity to his Favorite Person reestablished, Lil Man took it to be an open invitation because Cha Cha was decidedly not doing anything better with those shoulders and he could stretch his whole arms and legs out and be very comfy. So he did just that, with a smacking lick of his lips and a Lil Man sized grunt of effort as he stretched real real big before settling in with a flop.

Niamh&#39;s brow furrowed as Cain&#39;s scar came to view, the connection between the tussle and her history with Nyx clicking into place as she gave a small huff of displeasure and made another silent vow. The expression faltered after a beat, a flicker of recognition setting in that in the whirlwind of excitement to be taunting the public with their shirt-trophies Niamh had failed to <em>really</em> consider the low cut of the neck. She stiffened slightly, the hand that had come to rest on Yarrow&#39;s shoulder drifting to the base of her neck as she rubbed unconsciously at the pale rope of scarring that dashed the column of her throat like a collar. Willing it back into place, she let the gesture turn into an idle scratch before settling her arm back around Yarrow&#39;s shoulders with a light squeeze and returning her attention to watching as Luka finished his assessment of the grisly healing that Cain had endured. A later problem. There were plenty of friendly scarves around to steal.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Fortunately, I found someone a few towns over who was able to save it.&quot; Cain blinked, remembering her promise that she and Niamh cover Cha Cha&#39;s breakfast. She nodded at Val as the bartendered settled in. &quot;This one&#39;s breakfast is on my tab, especially if Niamh is getting his future massage. I owe him for dinner last night.&quot; She nodded to indicate Cha Cha, sending another small smile his way. 

She winced a little as Luka tested her range of motion. It didn&#39;t hurt, but her normal morning stiffness coupled with how heavily she&#39;d had to battle yesterday meant she was a little sore. <em>Hard to believe only a single day has passed after all the horrors we saw. It almost feels like I&#39;ve aged a year</em>, she marveled quietly. As Luka continued his assessment, he would find that her mobility to the front was mostly within a normal expected range, but Cain did find it difficult to extend her arm far back behind herself.

She hummed, thinking on Luka&#39;s question. &quot;Right after, it was appallingly weak. I took the opportunity to develop a two handed weapon fighting style. I figured diversity in approach never hurts.&quot; Cain grinned at the floor, her teeth bared as her expression took on a slightly feral bent; she was clearly lost in the memories of that time, though, not leveling that wild look at anyone currently present. &quot;I didn&#39;t exactly have time for proper treatment to get back to normal at the time. Anything you can do will be an improvement by my count.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But regulars would know that was normal; she evidently had her ways, as food was delivered from the kitchens even without her seemingly sending orders back. 

Axa was withdrawn into herself as more people showed up and… touched all over each other. The touches to Jaska drew her ambiguous gaze, but nothing touched her from the strangers, which she seemed relatively content about. 

Jaska might have needed a good cuddle, but unfortunately, he practically had a bear trap in his lap.

Her appetite seemed to wane as the environment became busier, and she stopped accepting the bites of food offered to her, settling her cheek against Jaska’s chest and staring in the general direction of the strangers without really looking at any of them. Cha Cha’s considerate greeting was wholly ignored.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was hard to say if he actually noticed Niamh&#39;s scars as well, given his eyes were one solid color, but he hadn&#39;t batted an eye at Cain&#39;s. He probably saw a lot of scars in his line of work, and they were just one more puzzle to solve in helping someone get their life back.

As much as he would&#39;ve liked to keep their adventuring party as minimal as it had started, he sure as hell didn&#39;t expect the four of them to sail a ship big enough to make the trip there in the first place. While he didn&#39;t know Cha Cha much, he knew enough to know the man was relatively reliable with a big heart and a need for justice that seemed pliable enough to their cause.

Though his oogling of Cain&#39;s scars came with a sort of familiarity that told how familiar he was with them, he didn&#39;t miss Niamh&#39;s arm retreating to grasp her throat. His head tilted towards her slightly until it rested against her, the arm looped around her giving her a comforting squeeze. A silent reassurance, even as his gaze casually slipped back to Luka&#39;s assessment of Cain with the hulking figure of Cha Cha occupying the corner of his attention.

Cha Cha quickly found his arm accosted, but didn&#39;t seem to mind that too much. It meant he didn&#39;t have to stand around awkwardly wondering where he should be. Though part of him was a little disappointed Axa didn&#39;t reply, he also hadn&#39;t really expected it and turned his attention to more receptive members of their little congregation. Lil Man&#39;s antics earned an easy chuckle, and his free hand reached up to give the beastie a good scritch on the head.

He huffed defensively as Niamh called him out on his stretching, the color in his cheeks blooming gently as Cain doubled up and offered to pay for his breakfast as well. Like a pincer attack, that only seemed to serve him up on a plate to Val for the finishing touch of a warm command. Well, no way of squeaking out of this one. He cleared his throat, disguising hiding his cheeks behind a scratch to his face. &quot;Mn, thank ya. I could go for some bacon and eggs with toast and hashbrowns. If that ain&#39;t too much trouble. And... I suppose a massage couldn&#39;t hurt either.&quot;

He watched Luka&#39;s assessment of Cain&#39;s range of motion, appreciating his professionalism even with her whole shoulder out. Not to mention his willingness to work with people&#39;s budgets. He had a feeling he&#39;d like Luka, and the prospects of being made to visit him for a massage seemed all the more appealing. As Niamh stiffened and shifted where she stood, he glanced down with a momentary frown, giving her hand a quick squeeze. Though he said nothing, his eyes seemed to ask if she was alright.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Just let me know when you&#39;re all free for appointments and I&#39;ll get you booked in.&quot;

That done, he promptly turned and headed right for Cha Cha, a bright smile on his lips -- alas, it seemed the focus was Little Man, who he began to coo over. &quot;Oh, and who is this charming little creature? I&#39;ve not seen anything quite like them! Are they as soft as they look?&quot;

It seemed his bickering with Jaska had been entirely forgotten about. Which suited the sleepy-eyed rogue just fine.

When she felt Cha Cha&#39;s eyes on her though, she realized with some chagrin that at this point he was less informed about the things that haunted her than their merry band of assholes. Partially by design - she&#39;d decided early on that there were things she wanted to leave behind entirely. But now with the benefit of hindsight, it felt unfair. That&#39;d be a conversation for later. For now, she just gave Cha Cha a tired smile and laid her head to rest on his shoulder. A little domino stack, Yarrow to her to Cha Cha.

It was enough for now that she was here and well. While he was no stranger to the concept of secrets, he also wasn&#39;t one to pry. It was only out of concern did he ask, and he trusted her to tell him what she needed from him. If all that was was a shoulder for now, he&#39;d provide it. He didn&#39;t need to know anything more to do that. Despite that, his fingers lingered laced in hers for the time being as he chuckled at Luka&#39;s cooing over Lil Man. Try as he might to pretend to be impartial, he was similarly smitten by those gormless eyes and teeny bappers.

Yarrow had raised his glass for a drink as Jaska asked out about Kelnari. In the time it took for him to take a slow gulp, the conversation had steered off course into Lil Man&#39;s eyes, and his gaze pulled from Jaska&#39;s to admire the delight almost hollowly. Of course, he&#39;d have to spill sooner or later, that&#39;d <em>been</em> the whole reason he&#39;d sought out Kel last night after all. Or at least the whole reason he&#39;d told.

Spotting the magpie, he gave it a squint and took another sip while the secondary conversation continued. The people in the room, he&#39;d made peace with speaking to, but the magpie was... a complication. One he wasn&#39;t sure he liked.

He gestured vaguely to the bird, looking back to Jaska. &quot;He&#39;s not gonna snitch, is he?&quot; He asked quietly so as not to distract the others from admiring Lil Man.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She closed her eyes in simple relief as Luka&#39;s skillful fingers seemed to immediately find the months, years of stress she&#39;d stored in her body, the fear and panic she&#39;d clung to to keep herself sharp. Stress had kept her alive, always ahead of her pursuers. It was... odd to feel allowed to relinquish that failsafe.

She opened her eyes, looking at each of her friends in turn. The people in this bar might make it possible for her to stop running, for once. She took a deep breath as Luka stepped away. She tested rolling her neck, eyes widening at the already improved range of motion. As she did, she caught Yarrow&#39;s eye on her exposed shoulder. When he met her gaze, she gave him a salacious wink and a grin. 

After thanking Luka and promising to stop by later this week for a full session, she moved back over to Yarrow. She slipped back into the spot at his side, moving his arm to wrap around her waist. She felt his gulp, his reaction to Jaska&#39;s question, felt a similar hollow pit in her own stomach that chased out the warm feelings she&#39;d had only moments ago. She shivered, grateful for the distraction as Yarrow pointed out the magpie.

&quot;If you say it won&#39;t be trouble, that&#39;s enough for me.&quot; Cain&#39;s voice was dark, quiet, but undeniably menacing as she spoke towards the magpie. She trusted Jaska&#39;s word implicitly, but figured a subtle threat never hurt as well.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Tiny barbells and <em>tiny mittens</em>,&quot; she mused, clearly enchanted by the idea of both.

All Lil Man had gathered from the conversation was that there was another person with clingable hair that was giving him the Good Attention, and that usually meant snackies. Lil Man was having a wonderful day.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He leaned in just a smidge to mutter back in amusement. <em>&quot;Surely</em> he can&#39;t commit as much mischief if he&#39;s wearing wee mittens.&quot;

Yarrow pursed his lips for a moment at Jaska&#39;s reply. It&#39;d been mostly what he&#39;d expected, not that he figured Luka was really the intimidating factor that kept Szix compliant. It certainly tracked though. As did his follow up reply regarding the trio&#39;s knowledge. No sense in waiting for Luka to politely leave either then, he realized in resignation. Not that he was opposed to him being here at all... But it wasn&#39;t exactly pleasant business he was here for. He had kind of hoped he could have kept his relationship with him as pleasant for as long as possible.

His arm was easily rewrapped around Cain&#39;s waist, head pulling from against Niamh to give Cain&#39;s arm a little kiss. If it was the bare shoulder he could reach, even better. With both Cain and Niamh in arm, he cleared his throat and gestured with his head to Jaska.

&quot;To answer <em>your</em> question, my <em>Quori</em> friend isn&#39;t involved. He had no idea the Sina had been stolen.&quot; With a softer mutter, he frowned distantly at the memory of this morning&#39;s revelations. &quot;...He looked like I&#39;d given him a taste of what we got yesterday when I told him.&quot;

He shook his head subtly, eyes closing as he thought back, past the tears of the morn to what he&#39;d admitted. Ever present in his mind was Kelnari&#39;s small voice. <em>It&#39;s not meant to be repeated. I&#39;ll leave it up to you.</em> The sensation of vines shifting uncomfortably within his body earned the smallest of grimaces. So much trust he&#39;d been forced to take, so much decision on his shoulders. He wasn&#39;t used to the responsibility that came with it. &quot;His people are refugees that came here.. through the Sina? It&#39;s a gate, right? Or part of it, anyways. Ephialtes guards the entrance. Not to keep them here, but to keep Dal Quor <em>out.&quot;</em>

His head flopped back with a troubled expression against Niamh again, eyes looking past the ceiling. &quot;His people aren&#39;t the problem though, they just want to live in peace and quiet. Their island is warded too, you can&#39;t get to it. He thinks the Captain had to have had an islander on the ship in order to actually make it there, whether willing or otherwise.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She stopped abruptly once she felt Yarrow adjust beside her, anchoring himself on her and Cain before speaking. Ah, the meat of it then. Her brow furrowed at the mention of the reaction Yarrow had gotten to sharing the news - budding sympathy for the stranger. It was hard to recontextualize their experiences in the manor with the knowledge of what Ephialtes really was, she realized bitterly. Part of her didn&#39;t want to forgive him for what he put her and her friends through, for the sake of having somewhere to direct her anger and hurt. Selfish. She felt herself softening as Yarrow explained the Quori to be refugees, though her lips pursed as he glossed over other details that left the picture muddy. She refocused when she felt the weight of his head against her though, and her hand lifted to his neck to run a thumb along his jaw.
&quot;We&#39;ll have to add that to the list of Jhaal&#39;s sins, then. His journal made it sound like they were there by invitation, but I dont put much stock into those observations,&quot; she added with a scowl.
&quot;So the Quori are from another plane? But there&#39;s spells for interplanar travel - why&#39;s the Sina so vital? And what - or who, I guess, is Dal Quor?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The warmth and affection of Yarrow&#39;s kiss on her bare shoulder were eagerly received. As Yarrow spoke, Cain contributed to the daisy chain of head resting by tucking her head into the crook of his neck. Like Niamh, Cain was feeling a slightly uncomfortable sympathy towards Kelnari, mostly born out of guilt for her snap judgement. The manor had been... difficult. She pursed her lips, working hard to mentally dissociate her frustration with the manor and Ephialtes from the only tangible target, Kelnari.

Confronted with the reality of Yarrow describing the Quori as a friend, and her own earlier admission that she too could be labeled a predator... Cain huffed, mentally admitting that perhaps she&#39;d been too quick to judge. &quot;I take it his people prefer the term Quori?&quot; she asked, already mentally updating her lexicon to replace the colonizer&#39;s <em>Dreamkin</em> with Kelnari&#39;s preferred descriptor. Cain shook her head. &quot;Honestly, I hate that we&#39;ve pulled him into something that at all makes him able to relate to yesterday. I wouldn&#39;t wish that on him, or almost anyone.&quot; She paused for a moment, thinking, as the conversation swirled around her.

&quot;Jhaal is the kind of imbecile who assumes entitlement, and refuses to re-contextualize his experiences if it would paint him as anything less than a savior.&quot; Cain&#39;s voice was bitter, but resigned as she agreed with Niamh. &quot;I don&#39;t suppose your fancy dictionary had any other information about Dal Quor?&quot; Cain squeezed Yarrow&#39;s hand as she addressed him. 

It was chilling to think that a Quori may have led Jhaal to the hidden island. Cain hoped they had been deceived, rather than a betrayer. She shifted uncomfortably again, as &#39;betrayer&#39; would also be a moniker certain individuals in her life would apply to Cain.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His thumb brushed along the back of her hand in appreciation.

&quot;Dal Quor&#39;s... the dream realm, I guess? Their people help.. <em>form</em> dreams while we&#39;re all snoozing down here, then go back to their business once we wake up. It was.. kinda hard to understand, and apparently harder to explain, so I didn&#39;t get too much other than that.&quot; He did his best to keep an even tone, though dreams were never really his favorite thing on a good day, even with Kel&#39;s much-appreciated dream sipping. Considering their jagged expressions, the idea likely wouldn&#39;t have made them any more appreciative of their handiwork either. Yippee.

He cleared his throat. <em>Focus, Yarrow.</em> &quot;Anyways. Current leader&#39;s a dick. Murderous asshole kinda vibes, so Kel&#39;s people got outta dodge, found the island, sought refuge with the people who lived there and have lived in relative peace and harmony ever since.

&quot;I... Think I&#39;d like more details on exactly what that entails, at some point. Not sure I love the idea of spectators,&quot; she muttered, her face flushed dark as she chewed the inside of her cheek. 
She fell silent for a moment, but nodded as Yarrow elaborated on the refugee situation - what it was they were running from.
&quot;So the Quori are able to transition to our plane and just exist here without issue?

As Niamh speculated on Jhaal&#39;s motivations, Cain nodded. &quot;Seems to make sense that he&#39;d be after something with the power to cross between realms. Assuming he could get it working, that is. Or that it works that way at all.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Yarrow&#39;s lips pressed a little thin as he gave a small shrug and an <em>&quot;ehhh&quot;</em> sound to Cain&#39;s conclusion regarding the Quori&#39;s role in the dreamscape. &quot;The way it was described, they&#39;re not really... enforcing any of it?

Or maybe they <em>are</em> willing because their current leader&#39;s a dick who does dick shit like give people nightmares. I dunno. That&#39;s besides the point.&quot;

Niamh&#39;s question about their existence here deepened his frown a little, and he finally unwrapped an arm to take another long gulp of his drink. At least their speculation regarding Jhaal&#39;s involvement was an easier headache to answer instead. &quot;I have no idea what Jhaal was trying to accomplish there besides get his grubby hands on shit that doesn&#39;t belong to him.

Jaska frowned as he listened in, eyes narrowed at the idea of these dream creatures having anything to do with his private affairs, regardless of the fact that they&#39;d probably been in <em>everyone&#39;s</em> private affairs apparently since the first creatures started dreaming.

She&#39;d spent much of her life without the option to choose her own course, and certainly didn&#39;t want to strongarm someone else into something they didn&#39;t want to do. &quot;If he can help keep the multi-legged menace off our backs while we sort an alternate, if needed, it&#39;s greatly appreciated.&quot; 

She swallowed, nervous for a moment, grappling with the reality of something she really had little control over. She actually hadn&#39;t considered that Kelnari might <em>not</em> help them, and the idea that he would leave them out to dry took her breath away. And, yet, her usual methods were less than applicable here. If she mucked up a relationship, she found herself startlingly unwilling to simply abandon ship and move on to the next city. Extremely disquieted, Cain took a healthy sip of her doctored coffee and attempted to soldier on. 

&quot;I guess... Well, he didn&#39;t ask for us to drop this in his lap. Thank you for talking with him.&quot; Implicit in her statement was that Cain trusted Yarrow to handle it. She trusted his judgement, his instincts on how to navigate the discussion. She turned, knowing her emotions were easily readable from her face, and kissed him on the cheek.
