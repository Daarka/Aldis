So as evening just began to creep in and the inn’s tavern was at the dawn of its busiest hour, it was nothing out of the ordinary for one face to be out of the ordinary; a slender, slightly petite, human-appearing young man, with something elegantly androgynous to his features. His hair would have been black, were it not for the subtle purple-indigo sheen when the light caught it just so, and the shock of a white streak growing only from one point at his hairline. It was bluntly cut at jaw length, in a slope that had the front a bit longer than the back, parted slightly to the side so some hung a bit over his right eye. But when that eye could be glimpsed, it was a soft, pretty silver in color, contrasting the warm gold of his less obscured eye. Between them both, in the center of his forehead, a strange (but pretty) rune seemed delicately etched into his flesh.

He was dressed casually, but nicely, his clothes varying shades of blacks and gunmetal blues, with the occasional gold accent. Nothing that spoke of notable wealth, nor poverty. Simple, nearly modest, but well suiting him.

He sat at the bar, a glass of wine in front of him with very little wine in it, but also sitting largely untouched as his gaze idly wandered the room, seeming content to people-watch. Occasionally his attention would fixate for a prolonged period on a single individual, but sooner or later, it’d shift elsewhere again.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, September 23, 2023 7:16 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Trading his usual stool at the bar, today he&#39;d lounged on one of the couches close to the fireplace, sprawled out with a bottle of wine all to himself. With his back to the bar it was a little difficult to see much other than the top of his head, messy blond hair poking up over the plush red velvet. A hand caressed his wine bottle before tipping it over into his glass. When nothing poured out, he groaned, what little visible slumping more in exaggerated despair before he began the slow journey back to a vertical position.

Yarrow turned, bringing the empty bottle and glass back towards the bar in an easy walk with just enough sway that easily suggested the bottle had not been shared. As usual, he was decked in a loose shirt with the front buttons shamelessly undone, the glitter and gentle rustle of necklaces following him over. His waist was wrapped in scarves and belts, the hilt of at least one dagger barely visible to the trained eye. His pants were tight in a flattering way, tucked into tall boots.

Though the bar had obviously been his first goal, the stranger&#39;s appearance paused his stride for just a moment. A brow raised, and one could almost imagine the gears churning in his head before he grinned, moving over to slide in next to him on the nearest stool. The bottle clinked gently on the bar as he first adressed the bartender. &quot;Get me another bottle, would you?&quot;

To the stranger, he winked. &quot;You look like you could use a top-off.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And... stayed pinned on him. Even before the brambly man had noticed him back. If someone had been watching <em>him</em> all night from afar, it would have given the impression that whatever he saw in the back of Yarrow&#39;s head, let alone the rest of his visage... it almost seemed to be what the stranger had been looking <em>for</em>. Whatever that entailed.

But without the context of his microexpressions in the hours prior, all Yarrow was met with was a pretty little smile as they locked eyes, and as Yarrow wobbled over (in a manner some would reasonably find to be the gait of a walking red flag) and offered to fill his glass, the stranger gave a soft, light little laugh.

&quot;My hero.&quot; He tilted his head just slightly, considering the man only a brief moment longer, before extending his hand. 

&quot;I&#39;m Kel. I suppose the least I can do in return for some wine is offer up my name.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He easily took the hand and gave it a shake in return, oblivious to the man&#39;s prior interest. Realistically, had he known, he simply would have walked over earlier; entertaining his forward nature now was easily enough to keep him around.

&quot;It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you, Kel. I&#39;m Yarrow. What brings a pretty face like yours all the way to Fielbarry, hm? Could it be you&#39;re here for an adventure? The guild does attract all sorts of handsome folk.&quot;

He shifted in his seat to better face the man, easily trading coin for a fresh bottle. True to his offer, he began pouring the first glass to Kel, topping him up before filling his own.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, September 23, 2023 7:57 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Not entirely sure, I suppose? Just haven&#39;t been before, and had the means to travel. What about yourself? You a local, then?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Ah, so just out to see the sights then. Always exciting. I&#39;m not <em>from</em> here, persay, but I&#39;ve been a member of the local adventuring guild long enough to be a regular face in town now. I could.. show you the sights later?

This place looks like it&#39;ll be bustling more and more as the night goes on, so I hope they don&#39;t run out of vacant rooms.&quot;

He finally lifted his glass for a tiny sip, tilting his head thoughtfully at Yarrow. &quot;You&#39;re with the guild, though? I&#39;ve... I mean, I&#39;ve heard the <em>gist</em> of what all that&#39;s about, but most things are more nuanced than the reputation they have from far away.

He gave another wink before settling back at the question. Did ganging up on the Duke&#39;s monstrous affliction count as slaying a huge monster? Yeah, he figured that counted. He gave a nonchalant shrug and a grin. &quot;It&#39;s a little of that, yeah. I&#39;d like to think of it as <em>problem</em> solving of the more... dramatic sense.

A very tall, too thin, shadowy figure appeared in the doorway, with ghoulishly long arms and fingers and lanky legs.

As he stepped into the light of the tavern, though, warm bronze skin replaced the shadowed darkness, and the fine, sculpted features of a man took place of any imagined horrors. Though... where his eyes should have been, there was only vanta black - eyes of a complete black that seemed to absorb any light, that looked like an endless void. Other than the eyes and odd proportions, though, he looked... rather normal otherwise. Silky black hair hung long and straight down around his shoulders and to mid-back, and he wore rather desert-y looking robes of a dark burgundy and black. Around his neck was a bolo tie, a palm-sized and clearly expensive ruby on a gold capped black corded leather string.

The slender man looked... tired. And a bit stressed. And clearly looking for some manner of escape as he made his way to the bar. After a brief perusal, he ordered a hibiscus coconut margarita and sank into one of the seats.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As Yarrow continued, speaking on the guild, he listened with rapt interest. As he concluded, Kel exhaled a mildly overwhelmed breath. &quot;I couldn&#39;t imagine doing that myself... that&#39;s incredible. I...&quot;

He paused. His back was fully to the door at that point, yet he inexplicably seemed to become <em>aware</em>, in some capacity, of the arrival of the lanky aasimar. Almost involuntarily, his head turned to land his gaze on the man, eyes slightly wide even before they had really taken stock of the individual&#39;s striking appearance. It seemed to take a conscious effort for him to pull his gaze back to Yarrow again, and he blinked a few times, face slightly reddened as he realized he had just drifted off mid-sentence. 

&quot;I... Oh, the monsters--sorry. I can&#39;t fathom it. It seems like it&#39;d be so dangerous--do people not get hurt?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ah yes, share a room with a stranger. If Kel did not know the type of man Yarrow was before, he certainly should now.

He was content to keep going, to keep prodding and teasing with little nothings and encourage flattery, but paused as his attention fully diverted to.. ah yes, Achoris. How he&#39;d noticed the man&#39;s entry was beyond him other than perhaps the sound of someone entering the bar, but he paid the specifics little mind. Instead, he flashed the aasimar a grin and a wiggle of his fingers in greeting, even as Kel turned back to apologize.

&quot;Heh, that&#39;s alright. And yeah, people do get hurt. Scars, even. I&#39;ve got a few if you&#39;re interested... but luckily, we&#39;ve got more than a few talented clerics that can just kiss it all away.&quot; he mimicked a chef&#39;s kiss motion. &quot;Just like that, then it&#39;s gone, and you&#39;re back up to fight another day.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The look on his face clearly was one of having no idea where to even begin processing this series of events--but simultaneously doing his best to take it in stride. 

As Achoris settled back and licked his literal wound, Kel&#39;s gaze settled on the brief appearance of red, blinking, as if he hadn&#39;t expected the bramble thorns in Yarrow&#39;s hair to actually... be that thorny? And simultaneously maybe scolding himself for not assuming a thorn to be a thorn.

&quot;Ah, ha...&quot; he managed in response to Achoris&#39; direct observation. &quot;I... I guess? That kind of thing is... subjective, isn&#39;t it?&quot; He said slowly, not fully meeting his gaze. Instead, his attention snaked back over to Yarrow, and he paused a moment, eyeing his admittedly curious head of hair. 

&quot;... I&#39;m sure you hear this so many times it makes you want to puke, but I&#39;m not sure I can hold off much longer: are you--an eladrin? Or something else entirely?

Oh, how shy he seemed. Either he was hiding something or he was genuine, and both options were equally delighting to the aasimar. He intended to find out which was the truth, tonight preferrably.

When Kel looked at him again, he recognized that look. It was indeed a question he&#39;d heard time and time again, even back before he&#39;d taken a seaward excursion. It helped that Kel was cute; he could gladly answer anything a thousand times if it was a pretty face asking. He chuckled, shaking his head. &quot;Good guess in most circumstances, but not quite. I&#39;m an aasimar. Descendents of gods, or.. other similar stuff.&quot;

He gestured between himself and Achoris. &quot;Haven&#39;t met many of us, but all the ones I <em>have</em> met have been a little... special in appearance. Part of our <em>divine</em> charm.&quot;

He glanced to the bramble hanging in front of his face as always, then waggled his brows at Kel. &quot;You can touch it if you want.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At his gesture to the other piece of bread in the sandwich, Kel looked back and forth between them a moment, obvious surprise and intrigue on his face, even if it was less than convenient to turn his head back and forth one hundred and eighty degrees each time.

&quot;You&#39;re <em>both</em> aasimar? Shit. I&#39;ve never met <em>one</em>, let alone two at the same time. This town is... Well, it&#39;s making an impression, alright.&quot;

He paused at Yarrow&#39;s offer, but only hesitated a moment, before leaning a bit forward, reaching out to curl slender fingers with unadorned, but well-kempt nails under the dangling vine. Not grasping it at all, but lifting it towards himself slightly, to let the strange foliage run over his skin a little, tilting his head curiously at it. 

&quot;Feels like any other bramble... I think. I don&#39;t often go around petting shrubs. But this is just a normal part of your body?&quot; He squinted a little, tilting his head a fraction the other direction as his thumb and forefinger delicately clasped the vine towards its end, lifting it up to inspect.

&quot;... Does it... photosynthesize? Like... do you notice a difference when it&#39;s in the sun verses kept in the dark for a long time? Because if you could <em>live</em> off of that nutrients as an alternative to food... that&#39;d be <em>incredible</em>.&quot; 

A beat, and his gaze refocused on Yarrow&#39;s face, giving him a small, lopsided smile. &quot;I mean, I imagine proper food would be a better indulgence. But still.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He settled quite nice and still as he gently grasped the loose bramble. Far more delicate than Cain had been, he noted. At least he wouldn&#39;t prick himself on it. It certainly felt like a normal bramble, as still as a normal plant would be. If he were to take a closer look at the man, surely he would note some of the other oddities. The lines of thorns running along his bare forearms, the hint of thorns on his collarbone poking out between his necklaces... The subtle patterns in his skin were likely just barely visible in the light at their current respectable distances.

&quot;I still definitely need food and drink.. its health is tied to my health, not necessarily sunlight. I don&#39;t really need sun any more than the average person does. Not to say I <em>dislike</em> a little sunbathing.&quot;

He smiled in return, his own gaze lifting to the curious rune in his forehead. &quot;What about you?

&quot;Ah... Nothing racial about that. I&#39;m just human. My magic just...&quot; He paused, stopping to actually give that thought, brow furrowed a little as he searched for his words. &quot;... Lives in my skin? I suppose? Hm. Makes it sound like a bacteria.&quot; He shook his head a little. 

&quot;They usually aren&#39;t visible when inert. That one has just... stuck around.&quot; He gave a vague gesture in explanation. &quot;Usually it&#39;s... this kind of thing--&quot;

With a small, understated, but graceful twist of his wrist, two little motes of... <em>something</em> shot in opposite directions from his fingertips: one launched towards Yarrow, and the other towards Achoris. Both splashed home on either man&#39;s cheeks, harmlessly leaving a little tickle of warmth, and a splatter like he had flicked them with golden paint. Simultaneously, that rune on his forehead blossomed with a gentle, warm glow--likely not strong enough to illuminate his surroundings in total darkness, and mostly drowned out in the ambient lighting of the tavern, but changing the appearance of the rune all the same. It no longer just resembled a scar-colored mark, but a shimmering touch of magic that couldn&#39;t seem to decide if it was blue, violet, or gold.

&quot;... Normally, you&#39;d <em>only</em> be seeing it now,&quot; Kel continued, something still a little shy to his words, despite him demonstrating very smoothly. &quot;I guess that one just got stuck.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1155396411693735946 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1155396411693735946><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, September 23, 2023 11:52 PM">11:52 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-spoiler chatlog__markdown-spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"> because i have it i might as well include it </span></span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1155318895209615420/1155396411052019752/Kelnari_glow_ig.png?ex=6559b0c2&amp;is=65473bc2&amp;hm=52357f1d33387e3bde23133bbc22e0b3b4b336a3ebe382a27f88da2c06fb76f2&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1155318895209615420/1155396411052019752/Kelnari_glow_ig.png?ex=6559b0c2&amp;is=65473bc2&amp;hm=52357f1d33387e3bde23133bbc22e0b3b4b336a3ebe382a27f88da2c06fb76f2&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: Kelnari_glow_ig.png (5.27 MB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

He blinked at the mote landing on his cheek, reaching up to brush at the place it&#39;d landed before looking to his fingers with a lazy curiosity before he looked back to the human with the fancily glowing rune. He found the shifting of color and glow of it just as pleasant as the rest of him, and smiled again. He briefly wondered if he had any more hidden runes in other places of his body, and resolved himself again to the task of bringing the man to bed at some point.

&quot;Interesting. I wonder whatever&#39;s got it stuck &#39;on&#39; then. Does it react to magic, maybe?&quot; Yarrow mused. Raising his free hand, he gave it a quick flourishing spin that almost resembled snapping his fingers until it was palm up - a small flame now dancing above his palm like a candle that shed a light that did appear capable of lighting their immediate surroundings were they in darkness.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Reaching inward, he mentally touched minds with the patron living within his ruby. &#39;<em>What about you, Ikiro? Have you seen anything about magic runes just... appearing on the skin when magic is used, or staying afterward?&#39;</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ikiro sounded... a little more bitter than usual. His words often had an air of disgruntlement to them, but he sounded a touch extra haughty presently--which he did not seem able to resist identifying a moment later. <em><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">Good for him,</code></em> he drawled, the words bone-dry. <em><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">Though some of us have to study for many lifetimes to acquire our arcane prowess, instead of simply being Born already capable...</code></em>

Seemingly oblivious to the judgment he was being subjected to, Kel watched Yarrow light up a little flame, smiling softly. &quot;In a sense--though not environmentally, no.&quot; Sure enough, the appearance of the rune--which continued to subtly glow--had not seemed to change in response to Yarrow&#39;s magic. &quot;Maybe I just cast the same spell too many times. Like when parents tell you not to keep making a face, or else your eyes will get stuck like that.&quot; He shrugged, clearly not fully believing in that theory himself.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

With a mildly irate sigh, Ikiro fell silent again for a stretch as Achoris watched Kel and Yarrow interact.

He listened to his further explanation, chuckling at the idea. &quot;What sort of spells <em>do</em> you cast so regularly then? If not an adventurer... an entertainer? You could take the stage with a pretty show, make some decent money.&quot;

Though he threw the idea out in the air, he was just as noncommitted to it as Kel was in the theory about the nature of his room.

He was half endeared by the idea, and half of him thought back to his circlet-assisted conversation with Nuala from his last adventure. He couldn&#39;t imagine they had much <em>interesting</em> things to say, but he couldn&#39;t deny it had some uses - after all, Kel&#39;d found <em>Fielbarry</em> through a squirrel. &quot;You sound more and more like some sort of fairy-tale prince, asking squirrels for directions.&quot;

As the question turned back to him and his capabilities, he offered another one of his patented lazy shrugs. &quot;I&#39;m not <em>terribly</em> learned in the arcane arts I&#39;m afraid, just picked up a couple useful tricks here and there. There <em>are</em> a few things I can do just because I&#39;m me, but some of it&#39;s best left away from pleasant company. Other than that though...&quot;

Yarrow trailed off, passing an eye behind the bar. The wine bottle was just <em>right there,</em> it wouldn&#39;t make for a decent vehicle for showing off. Spotting another bottle of something filled with tannins and delight, he grinned and reached out a hand in a grasping gesture. At the same time, the subtle patterning on his skin seemed to <em>shift,</em> a vine erupting from his forearm to lash out and yank the bottle back to his awaiting hand. It was over in an instant with his arm looking the same as it ever was, if not for the his new prize. His other hand set his glass of wine down to toss another few coins on the bar in payment, despite not having finished the first bottle. Just a little something something for later, if not tonight, surely another night.

&quot;Tada~&quot; He gave the bottle a triumphant wiggle.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He blinked, mind coming back to the present as Achoris explained his return. &quot;Your niece...&quot; he murmured, mostly to himself. Did he know who that was? He&#39;d figure it out sooner or later. Or maybe never, if he didn&#39;t care enough to know the finer details.

At least Achoris was on good terms with his divine patriarch... for what little good it did him here in town, anyways, he noted dryly.

&quot;Aren&#39;t you a sweet one? He did say the worst of it is over earlier. It looks to me like he just needs a good long drink and a good long night or two.

And with that thought-provoking statement, he undid his belt and let his robes fall from his lanky frame, undergarments following suit. True to the stretched-looking, lanky build of his body, his endowment wasn&#39;t girthy, but it certainly was long. And aside from his underarms and a small thatch of short-trimmed hair at the base of his cock, he was otherwise entirely hairless.

Kel gradually regained enough of his composure to notice he was rapidly becoming the most overdressed individual present. Drawing in a gentle, deep breath, he began to shrug off the cropped sort of vest that served as his only real outerwear (it was still warm enough in the season to not warrant anything much heavier), neatly folding it as he set it aside, simultaneously shifting to one foot and then the other to use his toes to pry off his shoes. He hadn&#39;t been the most covered up to begin with, but beginning to strip certainly didn&#39;t seem to be revealing any new or exciting marks or secrets on his body. Just more fair skin--and yet more still, as he next pulled his shirt off over his head to expose a slender, unmarred, and hairless torso. He didn&#39;t seem particularly <em>frail</em>, but he was hardly bulked with muscle. All the same, there was a layer of something there, subtle and lean though it was.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He could appreciate how easily Achoris&#39;s robes came off to reveal him in his full splendor. Yeah, he could see why he considered himself perfect, nodding subtly in approval.
Though his pants hadn&#39;t quite made it off his hips yet, they sagged low, revealing a happy trail of hair. It seemed that even with his elven ancestry, he managed to be the hariest of the three by the smallest of margins, similarly bare elsewhere. What he wasn&#39;t bare of were the trails of thorns along his collarbone, forearms, or the little trail that started above his toes and curved around the outside of the calf, and subtle scarring that told of his rougher lifestyle just from a quick glance.

Moving over, he grinned and pressed a hand against Achoris&#39;s torso, dragging it and his gaze slowly along the skin. &quot;Very nice. A painting could not do you justice.&quot; He purred, glancing to Kel before adding an approving &quot;Nor you.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His skin shivered lightly under the spidery touch, though his gaze twisted back to Kel to watch him undress with a subtle licking of his lips. How <em>would</em> they enjoy their little snack? Though he didn&#39;t quite share the same dietary needs as Achoris, he delighted in the words all the same. A hand reached to stroke his chin thoughtfully as he padded over to practically circle Kel. &quot;What a good question, what <em>should</em> we do?&quot;

He reached out for his chin to cup it, holding it in place to make him look up at him. While he wasn&#39;t as tall as Achoris, he still stood about 4 inches taller. If there was no resistance, his thumb would freely brush along Kel&#39;s lips with a feather-light touch. &quot;Tell me, how <em>good</em> are you with your mouth?&quot; he murmured expectantly, though his gaze suggested <em>hearing</em> his answer wasn&#39;t exactly what he was hoping for.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At Achoris&#39;s purr, the hand on Kel&#39;s cheek moved to the back of his head and tangled itself in his hair, the man taking him and his delightful mouth closer to stand before Achoris. He wanted a show? Yarrow was more than happy to put one on for him. His thumb began a slow rhythmic pumping into Kel&#39;s mouth in teasing approximation as he leaned in close to purr into his ear. &quot;Good boy, what a natural. Keep going.&quot;

His other hand freed itself from his hair to trail down his body, intent on relieving him of his shorts.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Soft skin that seemed to have never met a single hardship in its entire existence, not even calloused or toughened against casual wear, let alone scarred or otherwise marked. Kel certainly didn&#39;t look <em>concerningly</em> young in age, that was not an issue--but his complexion alone and the lack of weathering it bore almost implied it had not experienced the years Kel should have had behind him at all. Like a blanket of freshly fallen snow; pure, perfect... and similarly satisfying for Yarrow to be the one to stick his hands in and mess up. Though if <em>behavior</em> was anything to go by, the notion that he was the first to disrupt that perfect purity was almost certainly an illusion.

The rest of Kel&#39;s clothes were not nearly so complicated to remove as Yarrow&#39;s own attire had been. A drawstring pulled loose had his shorts sagging on his ever-so-slightly-pronounced hipbones--another feature of his that seemed to nudge the gendered implication of his appearance towards something more feminine. In truth, he had a subtle but undeniable hourglass shape to his torso, the androgyny almost <em>insisting</em> some nature of elven heritage, despite the most obvious disqualifier to that claim.

If his figure raised any curiosity towards the ageless question of <em>what&#39;s in his pants</em>, the answer didn&#39;t take long to arrive, as Yarrow&#39;s free hand negotiated the loosened waist of his shorts away from his body, until they slid more freely down his thighs, and gravity stripped them the rest of the way to the floor. Kel&#39;s undergarments were also leaning very feminine, comprised largely of lace--but consisting altogether of very little fabric, equating to more of a thong than anything else. The lace stood out starkly against his skin in black, and though it did a decent enough job of concealing everything it was supposed to conceal (inherent sheerness of the fabric aside), there was no denying the anatomy underneath. And Achoris at least would be subjected to a likely perfectly pleasing view of minimally-lacey cheeks. 

So likely no elven heritage, and not a man with feminine anatomy. Just... a prettyboy, evidently. The sub-gender of Twink.

He didn&#39;t look to be any more or less than averagely endowed, though it was slightly harder to say still (minimally) wrapped up as he was. As his shorts settled around his ankles, he unhurriedly stepped out of them, a toe nudging them off to the side and out of the way, before shifting even closer to Yarrow--his thumb still snugly in his mouth--and then slowly moving to slide down to a knee against the front of his body, taking care to keep his mouth over the entirety of his thumb all the while.

There was no denying his approval as he stepped a little closer as well, his own loosened pants becoming too tight for his liking. &quot;Look at you, all dressed up and pretty. What would you&#39;ve done if we hadn&#39;t shown up? Gone to bed all by your little lonesome in these cute little things?&quot; Yarrow teased, head canting to the side in endearment.

Not that he really expected Kel to respond with his thumb still occupying his mouth, letting the digit linger while he descended.

He stared into those eyes a moment longer before popping his thumb free, murmuring another &#39;good boy.&#39; His hands easily thumbed into the hem of his pants and undergarments, shrugging them both down and off with practiced precision, similarly kicking them aside where they&#39;d be out of the way. He was decently endowed for his size, but true to his word it was free of any of the brambles elsewhere on his body. From this close the patterns in his skin were far more apparent, almost like he were vines mushed into the shape of a man like clay.

He glanced back to Achoris. &quot;I&#39;m keeping the mouth.&quot; he declared before pressing his eager groin towards Kel&#39;s face.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He settled onto both knees, hands still lingering on Yarrow&#39;s hips, and there again was no real hesitation as he moved a hand to grasp Yarrow by the cock--gently at first, then tightening his grip to something more firm. Cocks were, typically, larger than thumbs, necessitating Kel&#39;s mouth opening a bit wider than it had before--and in the process of that, Yarrow was <em>just</em> perceptive enough to notice a little flash of teeth. Something he&#39;d expect to see when getting head from a tiefling, but which was more out of place with a human: ever so slightly pointed upper and lower canines. 

The glimpse came and went just as fleetingly, as Kel&#39;s lips closed over the head of Yarrow&#39;s cock, and as that gentle suction returned, there was at least no <em>sensation</em> of teeth involved. Kel evidently had the good manners (and practice) to avoid that faux pas as his head moved shallowly at first, in tandem with his hand still present lower on his shaft. His gaze stayed on Yarrow&#39;s face all the while, his free hand ghosting idly up the aasimar&#39;s thigh as he settled in for--well. He expected to be here on his knees in some capacity for a while.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The perfect treat for an adrenaline seeker. &quot;Fuck,&quot; he moaned, keeping his hands to himself for the moment. One dragged up over his hair to push is bangs and brambles back, avoiding all but the smallest pinpricks from years of practice.

His head lolled backwards as Kel picked up speed and rhythm, and any attempts to let him do his own thing were tossed to the side.

He had no claws, but there was still the littlest bite of nails with the gesture; not rough enough to be sincerely endeavoring to injure, but slightly more than a tickle.

With Yarrow&#39;s fists in his hair, Kel let his mouth slip lower down his length, inviting him deeper into the back of his throat. And deeper. And deeper. In fact, he would just keep easing his way forward with every thrust, until his nose began to brush Yarrow&#39;s body, evidently more than comfortable with handling such an intrusion. Though it simultaneously became less and less of a demurely quiet affair on his end, and the more ambitious sword-swallowing act was accompanied with the sounds of his throat and mouth carefully negotiating the feat without fully triggering himself to gag, resulting in inescapably lewd sounds. His fingers stayed furled into Yarrow&#39;s hips, as if to grab at them and encourage them closer, his eyes only watering a little bit as he watched the fruits of his labor on the aasimar&#39;s face.

And, of course, he hadn&#39;t forgotten the request for showmanship, with his back gently arched, lest his lacey ass end up obscured.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Beneath the lusty haze over his mind, some rational thought in the back of his mind appreciated how well he took him despite his initial more innocent airs. Far more convenient than an actual first-timer. Rational thought dissipated as Kel began to make such beautiful noises as well, the fire in his groin growing. Another hissed <em>fuck,</em> and he obliged the wordless request of closer, thrusting harder and faster with greater desperation. He looked down again to meet those mismatched eyes, his little mewls and moans and words of encouragement growing less and less coherent until he finally cried out in release, eyes fluttering closed from shaking pleasure.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Watching Yarrow come undone as Kel skillfully deepthroated him, soaking in the lewd noises. At one point he even decided to use Kel&#39;s rump as a foot rest, his breath coming in soft, shuddering sighs.

When Yarrow came, his grin widened, tongue briefly passing out over his lips. &quot;Once you&#39;ve cleaned him up, come sit on my lap,&quot; he commanded Kel rather imperiously. &quot;Facing him.

But without them, they simply left engravings of purple crescent marks on his hips and thighs. Though that still stung plenty good enough.

Kel didn&#39;t pull away as Yarrow climaxed. Quite the opposite; he pushed to take him as deep as he could manage, his throat constricting and fluttering around him as he both fought off his gag reflex, and swallowed what Yarrow spilled into the back of his throat. Only when Yarrow began to sag visibly did Kel seem assured he was on the other side of his peak, and he gently withdrew his mouth, taking a deep and well deserved breath and swallowing a few times to settle his throat. 

He hadn&#39;t seemed to mind Achoris propping his feet on his ass, and at the other aasimar&#39;s words, he merely gave Yarrow&#39;s cock a last, sort of goodbye-lick, before sitting back on the floor, delicately scuffing the back of his hand over his mouth. Because doing what he had just done didn&#39;t happen without a fair bit of drooling, and Yarrow wasn&#39;t the only one who was now a bit of a mess.

Rolling back to his feet, he didn&#39;t move straight towards Achoris, but instead made a detour back towards his pile of discarded clothes, stooping to rummage in his abandoned shorts. Digging through one of the pockets, he produced what appeared to be a little vial, slightly smaller than palm-sized (at least enough that it comfortably could be carried in his pocket as it evidently had been). Only then did he go to heed the rest of his given instructions, not much bashfulness seemingly left as he smoothly closed the distance to Achoris, obligingly helping himself onto his lap. Fortunately, the lace of his undergarments was the variety that was wonderfully silky to touch, and not the cheaper, scratchy kind. 

He had initially sat with his legs neatly crossing themselves, but that didn&#39;t interfere with him softly leaning his back into the aasimar&#39;s chest, looking over his shoulder as he offered the vial towards him. 

&quot;A little goes a long way,&quot; he said simply, his opposite hand ghosting fingertips along the side of the other man&#39;s lengthy thigh.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That would leave a mark he was sure, and the thought of it delighted him.

He looked over as Achoris spoke up, frowning for a moment at the question. &quot;I don&#39;t, though I probably should-&quot; He paused as he noticed Kel moving with purpose, eyes glinting anew. &quot;Oho! Looks like he really does have everything we need, doesn&#39;t he?&quot;

He moseyed over to Achoris&#39;s chair, leaning in to admire the view of them both while a hand stroked the other aasimar&#39;s chest. &quot;Did you like that?~&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Once he&#39;d finished lubing himself up, he poured a bit more on his fingers and slid them down the back of the strap of his thong, rubbing around Kel&#39;s entrance and pressing those long fingers lightly against him. &quot;Do you want the undergarments to remain on, or off?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I&#39;m not strongly opinionated one way or the other. What would you prefer?&quot; He murmured back.

Achoris was quite content for those darling little panties to stay on, as they flattered the twink rather spectacularly. Over the course of the next however many hours it took for them to indulge each other to the fullest, it ended up with the three men in a puppy pile of naked limbs tangled together on the bed, pillows thrown about until everyone was comfortably arranged. Achoris laid on his back, his head pillowed on Yarrow&#39;s upper thigh, absently tracing the thorny patterns on his legs with one hand while the other rested quite contentedly on the curve of one of Kel&#39;s ass cheeks, occasionally giving it a caress or a squeeze.

&quot;Well,&quot; he breathed with a gusty sigh, tipping his head back and closing his eyes, a languid smile on his lips. &quot;I have to say, I haven&#39;t had this much fun in upwards of a decade. We really must do this again sometime.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Strictly platonic fucking here. &quot;Bunch of drifters, aren&#39;t you? Well, that&#39;s fine by me. A couple weeks is plenty of time to fuck around. I&#39;ll be here, probably. As long as there&#39;s no guild summons or anything..&quot;

He gave Achoris a little nod as he explained his own planned trip, belatedly remembering that he was only here temporarily. There was usually only so long you could crash on someone&#39;s couch before it was time to head home. &quot;Business, so vague. Wonder what kinda crazy shit you&#39;ll get up to.&quot; he teased, though with how his attention lazily drifted back to Kel, it was fairly evident he wasn&#39;t actually prying into the nature of his business. As far as he was concerned, he could keep his secrets, so long as he could poke a bit in jest.

&quot;I would be quite pleased if you lingered. You give a few folks in town a run for their money - besides, I think it&#39;d be fun to introduce you to a few of my friends. The more the merrier, right?&quot; Yarrow purred, the hand brushing Kel&#39;s hair moved to gently stroke his jawline.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Even Yarrow, for whom troubled sleep was largely unavoidable, would find himself in a sort of peaceful nothingness, void of any dreams at all--not unlike how he had spent one night in the company of a stranger on his way to Ghalasine with the guild.




Achoris had fully drifted into similarly well-deserved rest, and was in a dead sleep when Ikiro&#39;s voice stirred at his consciousness, prodding at it.

<em><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">Achoris... something&#39;s very wrong. Wake up. Achoris!</code></em>

What the tabaxi had the capacity to sense when his warlock was sound asleep was not elaborated upon. But as Achoris opened his eyes, blinking into the darkness of the room, he would at least find some merit to Ikiro&#39;s insistence. 

There was light in the room that had not been there before. In the otherwise tranquil darkness, there was an eerie, blueish glow coming from very near to Achoris&#39; position. A blink or two more to make sense of what he was seeing would reveal a jarring, alarming visual: Yarrow seemed perfectly asleep, but Kel was not. He instead was delicately bent over the other man, his mouth open in an expression that could only be described as <em>ravenous</em>, eyes wide and pupils constricted to tiny pinpricks amidst irises that swirled with that eerie glow like liquid mercury. But the light was not primarily coming from his eyes; it came from tendrils of <em>something</em> that looked to originate on Yarrow&#39;s closed eyelids, which was dragged through the air in perfectly silent, confusing wisps of light--and into Kel&#39;s open mouth, slithering out of sight between prominently pointed canines that were impossible to miss with his mouth open in such a way. That glow even continued from within his body, the presence of whatever that light was gently illuminating from the inside of his throat, down into his core, leaving the shadows of his ribs and other such anatomy backlit from within. Every couple of seconds, there was a subtle movement of Kel&#39;s throat, as he actively appeared to swallow whatever was being siphoned--in no small quantity either, by the looks of it--from Yarrow&#39;s sleeping form.

And for at least that split second, as Achoris took in the unexpected sight, Kel did not yet seem to notice the third party in the bed had awakened, his focus unblinkingly on the sleeping aasimar beneath him. If the aasimar had looked upon him predatorily before, it paled in comparison to the cold, hungry, nearly <em>vicious</em> look Achoris witnessed in that moment.</span></div><div class="chatlog__attachment chatlog__attachment--hidden" onclick=showSpoiler(event,this)><div class=chatlog__attachment-spoiler-caption>SPOILER</div><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1155318895209615420/1158617059891085405/SPOILER_SPOILER_Kelnari_Sucking_Yarrow_Dry_Brazzers_Logo.png?ex=655c2db9&amp;is=6549b8b9&amp;hm=1525b9d92920201a0243500ba9d8d7f2f24760ed4dfa9049d5f0f6604d1987d7&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1155318895209615420/1158617059891085405/SPOILER_SPOILER_Kelnari_Sucking_Yarrow_Dry_Brazzers_Logo.png?ex=655c2db9&amp;is=6549b8b9&amp;hm=1525b9d92920201a0243500ba9d8d7f2f24760ed4dfa9049d5f0f6604d1987d7&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: SPOILER_SPOILER_Kelnari_Sucking_Yarrow_Dry_Brazzers_Logo.png (4.2 MB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

His patron had been a helpful alarm clock a few times in the past. Black eyes snapped open and immediately honed in on the sight of Kel and Yarrow, and for a moment he remained frozen, stunned and fascinated by what he was seeing. But at the sudden realization that it could be Yarrow&#39;s very soul being sucked out, he did the first thing that came to mind: 

A sharp word in Celestial was all that was needed to cast Counterspell, to try to abort what Kel was doing. And at the same moment, he rolled to a kneel and summoned his pact weapon into his hand, a Was scepter with a blade at the head in a shape loosely similar to the sloped visage of Set, to attempt to thrust between them and hook the back of the blade to Kel&#39;s throat.

As the weapon suddenly appeared and planted itself across his neck, Kel gasped in a ragged, blindsided inhale, fumbling to lift his hands in surrender. That fixated look that had been on his face was replaced in an instant with what seemed to be a very genuine horror, his eyes still glimmering slightly with lingering traces of whatever had taken place. 

&quot;--Wait! Wait, I&#39;m--It&#39;s not--&quot; he choked, looking thoroughly caught off guard as his attention shifted entirely to Achoris.

Depending on how hard it was to wake Yarrow up, the sudden commotion and speech from both his companions may have roused him. If he did awaken, it would be an indistinguishable experience from simply being woken up in the middle of a very restful, blissfully dreamless night&#39;s sleep by any other sudden sound.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Just... broad themes that have a particular weight to them... sometimes those bleed through.&quot;

He drifted off a moment, staring at the shirt in his hands. His lips twitched minutely after a second as he mumbled something well under his breath, looking distracted and deeply thrown off whatever rhythm he&#39;d had before. 

&quot;... I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry, I... I think I need some air,&quot; he decided after another pause, finally stirring to pull his shirt back on, not looking up as he started to head for the door. &quot;I&#39;ll... be back in a bit.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Giving a mildly uncomfortable clear of his throat, he rolled back to grab the bottle he’d dropped to snag it again before sitting up once more. Now that he was awake, it’d take him a bit before he was able to get back to sleep again. “I could probably use a walk too.” He murmured, mostly to himself.

His gaze drifted back to Achoris curiously. Though he wanted to ask him about the wings and crown, sexy as they were, a different question burned in his mind instead. “What exactly happened back there? Like.. that glowing. I’m pretty sure humans don’t glow like that. Unless that’s all tied to his… whatever.” He said, gesturing to his forehead in allusion to Kel’s rune.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Maybe that should&#39;ve bothered him too, but being sensitive to other people&#39;s emotions wasn&#39;t exactly one of his strong suits.

He pursed his lips in thought as he tried to imagine what Achoris had seen, nodding slowly. Kel&#39;s inhuman nature seemed to be a conclusion they all shared, though he snorted a little. &quot;I knew about the teeth,&quot; he flashed Achoris a grin. &quot;he was preetty careful with them earlier.&quot;

Something still nagged in his gut from sitting here in the dark. If they weren&#39;t going to mess around while they were awake still and he wasn&#39;t falling asleep any time soon, he was going to get restless quick. With a defeated sigh, he pulled himself from the bed to pick out his clothes.

I believe you&#39;re along for the ride whether you like it or not.</code></em>

A few moments passed, before Achoris found himself... almost blacking out? It was a strange sensation, to be perfectly conscious and lucid, and yet to be drawn out of his bodily senses and into a vision instead. He could <em>sense</em> Ikiro sharing that experience alongside him, more directly than he usually felt the tabaxi&#39;s presence, though he did not see him. Instead, after a confusing and mildly disorienting blur of color and shape and swirling sensations... the image of Kel formed in front of him.

The world immediately surrounding Kel appeared strange; out of focus, almost. Achoris found himself needing to put a dedicated effort into making anything out--but Kel himself was perfectly clear. He was seated on the ground, one leg stretched out straight in front of him, with the other bent up, and one arm draped lazily over the raised knee. His head rested back against a surface behind him, and he stared seemingly off into space with an... oddly empty look. There was not the fear or panic attack that he had displayed moments ago, but there was also not anything... overtly cold or sinister. Just emptiness. Listlessness. 

As the vision took shape, he was speaking quietly, his lips tiredly moving with the words that at first seemed to just be more mumbling to himself. But a second to focus, and Achoris would be able to discern his soft words.

<em>&quot;... I know. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t appreciate your optimism,&quot;</em> he sighed, sounding... so existentially tired. <em>&quot;But...&quot;</em> A pause. His jaw clenched a moment, then relaxed again. <em>&quot;... Things were alright with Tomas at first, too.&quot;</em> A pause of silence.

<em>&quot;... Maybe. But forgive me if I&#39;m not placing bets on it.&quot;</em> It was... a bit odd for just mumbling to himself. It instead sounded very much like one side of a proper conversation with something else. <em>&quot;I just... I got too overzealous. You&#39;d think by now I&#39;d know better. Maybe your optimism got to me,&quot;</em> he added with the ghost of a snort. <em>&quot;Beggars can&#39;t be... greedy. Or... something. I don&#39;t know. It would have felt wrong to stop and look a gift horse in the mouth. I... should have just waited. It&#39;s just... gotten so uncomfortable... Midrest feels like months ago...&quot;</em>


As Yarrow left the inn and looked around for where the twink had gone, it wouldn&#39;t take him a terribly long time to find him. Kel hadn&#39;t gone very far, just about halfway down the block, nestled into a relatively narrow alley between buildings. He sat on the pavement with his back to one of them, staring off at the opposite wall, but otherwise looked just as Yarrow had last seen him. In his care to be subtle about his approach, Yarrow was able to draw closer without being immediately noticed, enough for <em>him</em> to notice the soft mumbling Kel was doing, half under his breath, though he wasn&#39;t close enough to get a very clear understanding of the words themselves.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 4, 2023 6:32 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His midnight sojourns were frequent enough that it was almost second nature to him. Granted, he wasn&#39;t usually <em>barefoot,</em> but he had long learned how to see in the dark and work with the shadows as friends and not hazards. He saw Kel first, pausing as he regarded his chosen hiding spot. Well, not <em>much</em> of a hiding spot. Just enough for anyone not looking, or unfamiliar. He slid in slowly, head tilting a moment as he realized the soft unfamiliar sound in the town&#39;s usual cacophany of silence was coming <em>from</em> Kel. His voice, at least, he knew, though he couldn&#39;t pick out the words.

If he was meant to know, he&#39;d probably have heard the words by now. He knew that. He knew what happened when you looked or listened too much at something you weren&#39;t supposed to. All the same... it&#39;s not like he could resist his curiosity. He hadn&#39;t even gotten to <em>see</em> what Kel had done to him. The least he could do was pick up his own pieces. He slipped into a nearby shadow, tentatively creeping closer while his ears strained to hear his words.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He didn&#39;t quite understand the implications, but he was smart enough to glean a few very important things. One, this was definitely a conversation, with someone that seemed equally nuisance and advisor for Kel. Two, if this is how Kel liked to make friends, it was little wonder he traveled as often as he did. Traveling meant instability,  uncertainty. <em>Not looking a gift horse in the mouth indeed.</em> And Three... there always was a catch, somewhere.

&quot;Not enough &#39;Nightmares&#39; in Midrest?&quot; he asked. Though his voice was casual, almost innocent, the gleam in his eyes was focused. That predatory expression from earlier was back, with many layers of playful flirtation stripped away until he seemed more like a cat watching a mouse with sharpened claws.

Though perhaps to Kel&#39;s relief, he did not immediately move for the pounce. He&#39;d been willing to still share his bed earlier, after all.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Kel whipped around in pure reflex, and in an alarmingly short instant, his hand was holding an intricate pistol to press its tip under Yarrow&#39;s jaw. For that instant, his face had blanked of expression, lips tight and eyes just a little bit wide.

That heartbeat came and went, and recognition settled in. The pistol was withdrawn fully. While such weapons were far from common, the particular weapon in his hand did not appear to be a &quot;normal&quot; pistol. There wasn&#39;t even a visible trigger--and the front of the muzzle had no discernable hole from which ammunition would presumably be launched. Instead, the pistol&#39;s barrel resembled the miniature, stained glass window of a cathedral, and the tip came to a point in the form of a needle-like crystal. What looked to be truly <em>glass</em> was colored an array of dusty blues, violets, and golds, but further towards where Kel&#39;s hand gripped it, that glass was more and more overcome with scarlet hues. A couple raw gems could be glimpsed embedded into the grip, though further details were a little hard to glean, as Kel proceeded to tuck the weapon neatly atop his lap. Wherever it had been pulled from, he didn&#39;t yet return it to that place, eyeing Yarrow with caution as he tried to ascertain what he was doing.

&quot;... What? Did you change your mind?&quot; He asked slowly, the words soft and... not really as aggressive as they could have been. He sounded as cautious as he looked.

Though he&#39;d originally held his shirt closed to prevent any loose fabric flaps from alerting Kel to his presence, now he let the unbuttoned panels drape along the ground as they pleased.

He glanced around the alley they were in. &quot;You&#39;re not wrong, there&#39;s definitely no one else here... but that&#39;s not really answering the question, is it? There&#39;s other ways to talk to someone, even at a distance.&quot;

He was very much the cat that curiosity killed, as evidenced by his current prison.


Kel stared back at Yarrow with a completely deadened expression, void of fear or surprise. He calmly lifted the pistol to press its pointy crystal tip into the soft of his wrist, just enough pressure to physically persuade his hand away from its grip without actually endeavoring harm.

&quot;Is that out of your system now?&quot; He replied emotionlessly. &quot;I will once again reiterate that I have done <em>nothing</em> detrimental to you in any capacity. I got rid of your budding nightmare, stupidly presuming that to be a boon to you and not something I would have my life threatened over twice in a row. If I had known it would result in a fraction of this hostility, I wouldn&#39;t have touched you. I don&#39;t endeavor to linger where I&#39;m not welcomed.

Kel finally seemed to relax a tiny fraction as some of that intensity bled out of Yarrow, giving him a better grasp on where they stood with one another. The pistol settled back into his lap again, and after a pause, he gradually leaned back against the wall he had been propped against as well.

He didn&#39;t look remotely affected to be dubbed Not Currently Fun, his eyes half-lidding slightly as he regarded the aasimar emptily. There was still a sort of... dead air about him. Even those not particularly good at reading expressions and body language would likely have a fair idea that he was thoroughly unequipped for socializing off the known script--and both Achoris and Yarrow&#39;s shrugging acceptance of what had been witnessed from him was not on his existing script.

&quot;... I did not realize that not being <em>good guys</em> would lower one&#39;s threshold for repulsion.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The vision of the scry only had seconds left on it. Ikiro dropped it, giving Achoris back both his senses, and his usual connection to his magic. A moment later, the tabaxi grumbled an arcane word, and Achoris would find his inability to dress himself a non-issue as his entire form disappeared from sight.

Once out the doors, he spread his now-invisible wings and took flight, doing a quick loop over the nearby buildings and alleyways until he found his quarry, at which point he lightly landed on the edge of the roof above and settled in to watch and listen.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Finally, he relented with a vague, &quot;Huh.&quot;

His finger idly shifted over the texture of the pistol&#39;s surface for a stretch of silence. Then his wrist gave a small, careful twist--and the gun was simply gone.

He slowly rolled back to his feet, brushing his shorts off. &quot;... You should get back to bed. You look ready to keel over.&quot; His words--and expression--both still came across as rather empty. Withdrawn. &quot;You don&#39;t need to worry about me with your boundaries. I&#39;ll leave you be.&quot; It wasn&#39;t entirely clear if he was speaking short term or long term. &quot;...

It was true he only knew the man about as well as any other one night stand of his, but he couldn’t quite keep that curiosity contained. It wasn’t often he met someone as pliable as Kel was around a singular stony pillar of determination. It’d been a long time since he was that non-obtrusive too.

He reached out a hand to lace around Kel’s wrist, fingers surprisingly gentle compared to their earlier grip. The smallest of movement might break him free of it, if he so desired. The aasimar stayed where he sat for the moment, looking up at him from his lounging position. “Stay the night. Leave in the morning if you like, but at least leave with a full night’s rest.”

It was a request. Not quite an apology for the earlier confusion nor his threats, but… it was something. An offering to just take one night and <em>be.</em> He could do with it what he wanted afterwards.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 4, 2023 9:48 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“… I won’t leave town,” he replied after a moment. “But I need to be alone right now. I’m sure I’ll see you again soon.”

With that, he gently withdrew from his hold, turning to start back down the alley. He only made it a few steps, though, before slowing to a halt again. He hesitated, before turning back to the aasimar.

“Speaking of setting boundaries. If you go around telling people things I clearly prefer kept to myself, I’ll kill <em>you</em>.” The words were cold and emotionless, spoken with the unwavering resolve of someone who was, if nothing else, perfectly confident with their ability to back up the threat. “And it won’t look like what happened tonight.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Yarrow nodded, the corners of his lips quirking in a smile at the assurance of seeing him again. He certainly would see him again soon, if he could help it.

Though the threat was a surprise, that little twitch broadened into a crooked smile. Such assurance in his threat... He could summon a gun from nowhere, that certainly put some weight behind his words, but it was the fact he put any stock in the threat at all that interested Yarrow. He liked that assurance. He liked the threat, and though he was perfectly content to let him have his way for now... that little voice in the back of his head whispered, eager for more. What other edges sat beneath the surface? How many more places could he prod before he understood the man beneath the pleasure?

Another time. He gave a little flourish of his hand, bowing ever so slightly from his reclined position against the wall. &quot;As you wish. See you soon.~&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He tucked his hands in his pockets, his posture perfectly mundane as he headed back down the path, leaving Yarrow&#39;s line of sight eventually. His steps were quiet as he went, and it didn&#39;t take long for his presence to fully evaporate from where the little confrontation of sorts had taken place. 

But his trajectory beyond that point, of course, was no longer within either aasimar&#39;s awareness, lest he be further pursued. 

Ikiro grumbled a thoughtful noise. <em><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">... If his word is to be taken as truth, he at least isn&#39;t making a beeline out of town.</code></em> A pause. <em><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">The issue with That is that I&#39;m rather of the opinion that everything coming out of his mouth is a lie.</code></em>

Ikiro was very old--older than Achoris. Wisdom usually came with age. But that usually assumed the individual in question spent those many years of life surrounded by experiences in socializing. And if there was one thing most archmages tended to have in common... it was a deep desire for solitude, and a disdain for most company. And while Ikiro was sharp as a tack, and an invaluable resource for a great wealth of knowledge... he was also petty and cynical and grievously haughty. Even if his judge of Kel&#39;s character was objectively proven wrong, as far as the tabaxi was concerned, his mind was already made up. But broken clocks were still right twice a day, and his cynicism towards Kel was not an unreasonable conclusion to have reached...</span></div></div></div></div></div>
