His siblings had arrived that a same day as well, a mason and carpenter both eager to get to work on what they understood to be a possible new venture for their community outside of Belhaven&#39;s sewers. A third, much smaller lizard had come along with them - apparently at the behest of their father, so the little one could experience the world (and be kept out of trouble in Belhaven).

The next day work began in earnest. First, an assessment of the intact structure&#39;s integrity to see what could be left standing, and what was better to tear down and repurpose or discard. On this first day introductions were done as well, for those that had decided to come and help. 

The first was Grask, a much larger specimen of the lizardfolk people, and the mason in the endeavour. The second was Shashk, the carpenter of the endeavour. She was somewhat taller as well, but had surprisingly dextrous hands and fingers well suited to her work. The third, and smallest, was Ashkri, the baby brother. They all had similar colourations to Kaskra - various shades of brown, arranged in a leopard spot fashion. Shashk and Ashkri stood out in some respects, however, with the former having the barest traces of silver colouring under her eyes and at the tips of her fingers. The latter had a decidedly more pronounced streak of unusually shiny black scales along his back and tail.</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=lizard><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=🦎 src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/twitter/twemoji@latest/assets/svg/1f98e.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>4</span></div></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1165350255160737863 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1165350255160737863><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, October 21, 2023 12:05 PM">12:05 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>From there, the work continued. Days two and three were spent clearing the surface of rubble, and the fourth day was spent on knocking down the unsteady and unreliable walls and beams, only to have them replaced with temporary wooden supports to make things a touch safer as the next steps were considered.

The weather, at least, remained favourable. There was a slight chill that necessitated a fire to the side for the lizards to warm themselves by every so often, but no rain nor frost had set in yet to make the work more complicated than it needed to be. Come midday of the fourth day, the lizards had decided to take a break in their camp next to the ruins, inviting any helpers to join them if they wished and share in what food they had brought with them.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Their forage paths into the fields and surrounding towns were well worn at this point, and they visited each spot to collect the last of the season&#39;s offering. Nuts, seeds, edible plants, and late summer berries were all equally ripe for Clove&#39;s plucking. 

Even though Clove&#39;s access to shops and food was much greater than it had been in the swamp, the patterns of preparing for winter were deeply ingrained in the little goblin. The work was simple, and honest, but suited Clove well. After each collection, Clove left a small cache of acorns mounded in tribute, a general thanks to the land for the bounty.

Clove had been delighted to learn that their friend Kaskra was working on a new renovation project. They&#39;d packed up some tasty plants, and a recently brewed jar of sun tea, wanting to share some goodies with the workers. After donning a customary mushroom hat, Clove embarked off to the old ruins.

Upon arriving, Clove spent a few moments fussing with the things they&#39;re brought, getting them ready to share. They brightened as the lizardfolk called for a break, jumping up and down with an eagerly waving arm.

&quot;Oh, um. I like your shiny black scales.&quot;

The latter statement was said in lieu of any more standard greeting to Ashkri.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1165356945906094231 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1165356945906094231><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, October 21, 2023 12:32 PM">12:32 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-spoiler chatlog__markdown-spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)">Today Clove is wearing a large blue mushroom hat!</span></span></div><div class="chatlog__attachment chatlog__attachment--hidden" onclick=showSpoiler(event,this)><div class=chatlog__attachment-spoiler-caption>SPOILER</div><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1165350224466804836/1165356945557958707/SPOILER_entol11.png?ex=6590623b&amp;is=657ded3b&amp;hm=dfdec400d5bbacf481337dc89d419251ad458778af066c4ddee83820c4bb874b&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1165350224466804836/1165356945557958707/SPOILER_entol11.png?ex=6590623b&amp;is=657ded3b&amp;hm=dfdec400d5bbacf481337dc89d419251ad458778af066c4ddee83820c4bb874b&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: SPOILER_entol11.png (570.65 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

She was from the taiga, she could take a little piddly occasional chill in Fielbarry. Though she eagerly agreed to help Kaskra with renovations, both to help a dear friend of hers, it was also to explore the ruined building he&#39;d found. <em>And,</em> to her delight as she approached, to meet some of his family.

&quot;Heeeeyy!&quot; She called out from whatever constituted as &#39;the road&#39; there. Though she looked like she wanted to wave, but both arms were chock full of large bundles. The closer she got, the more defined the bundles were, appearing to be a mixture of pelts and a rug which practically dragged behind her with how long it was, even rolled up. It was perhaps a little too early for decorations, but there surely wasn&#39;t anything wrong with something warm underfoot.

&quot;I broughts some stuffs. Nice rug for standing, and pelts! Stone is cold, this will be good for warms.&quot; She nodded sagely. Despite still wearing effectively a crop top, the warm furs around her shoulders and waist were very effective for keeping her comfortable no matter the chill.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The trio seemed more than happy for the presence of the little goblin and their food parcel, especially since a fourth adult meant that the young and excitable lizard could perhaps be kept entertained.

In response to the compliment on their scales, the young lizardfolk gave a little shimmy and spun around to show them off. &quot;Thanks! Pops says they make me lucky!&quot; he beamed, at least in body language and tone of voice. &quot;I like your hat! Do you have others?&quot;

Come lunch time, the group scooted over to camp just in time for Cairn&#39;s rug delivery to arrive. She was met similarly by Kaskra, though it was his sister that would speak on his behalf. &quot;Thank you, dear. It&#39;s a <em>touch</em> early for any rugs, but once we have our ground floor cleaned up they&#39;ll be a blessing in this weather.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

While Clove might have snorted at being defined as an adult, they were indeed more than happy to entertain the youngest lizard friend. They did a small spin as Ashkri asked about the mushroom hat, nodding yes that they did indeed have a multiplicity of mushroom hats. Having demoed a full circle view of the hat, Clove grinned back a snaggle toothed smile. &quot;I thought I saw a cloud of luck around you. Do you want to try it on?&quot;

As Cairn approached, Clove gave a mighty wave.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Grask finally moved over from the fire he had been tending, extending a hand to Cairn in greeting. &quot;Family, yes. He&#39;s written some to us about Fielbarry&#39;s residents, but it&#39;s good to finally put a face to the name. Cairn, I take it?&quot; Should Cairn decide to shake, she&#39;d find his hand meaty and calloused, with a <em>much</em> firmer grip than she was used to from Kaskra. Big brother indeed.

Ashkri, for his part, seemed absolutely thrilled at the idea of wearing a mushroom, all but bobbing his entire body in a frantic nod. As if that wasn&#39;t enough, his little grabby paws reached out as well, just barely managing the bit of self control necessary not to snatch the hat without permission.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Magic is very impressive. I would love to see a trick.&quot; Clove whispered back, before plopping themselves down on a nearby stump to make sure they had an excellent view.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A personal project, one unlikely to yield any sort of profit, but it is to help family.&quot; He walked a bit away, picking up some of the rubble that used to make up one of the chapel&#39;s walls. &quot;The stone, even what we cannot use here, is good. It is a pleasure to work with it.&quot; He handed her the piece, for what it was worth, and depending on her knowledge of rocks and bricks, she&#39;d be able to tell that he wasn&#39;t lying. Despite its presumed age, the chapel <em>was</em> built with proper stone. If nothing else, it showed that whatever was once here, was built by people who cared a great deal for their god - or at least had the money to splash out.

Ashkri, on the other hand, was further thrilled at having an audience to work with. Scooting aside to have his back to the adults, he started to wring his little lizard hands together. At first, nothing happened. It seemed for everyone that could see (and Kaskra <em>was</em> seeing, knowing well his baby brother&#39;s tendencies) that the little lizard was struggling to make fart noises with his hands. Then there was the barest redirection of the air, a slight tug at the clothing that was gone as quickly as it started, replaced with a glowing substance dripping from his hands. With a flick, the goop flew into the air between himself and Clove, manifesting as four amorphous, glowing blobs that bobbed up and down between the two small figures. &quot;Ta-da!&quot; he exclaimed, thoroughly proud of himself as the little orbs floated to rest on his hands, tail-tip and nose.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She gave it a sniff, then a curious lick before nodding sagely back at Grask. “Is good stone. They were either smart or lucky when they builds this place. And now we are both smarts <em>and</em> lucky to finds it free for the taking.”

She set the rock aside, twisting it just so that the prettier side was facing in where they stood. “I’m not used to rocks and stone. Mine home is primarily built of leathers and fabric with tall branches, bones, and metal supports to stretch them out. Far less heavy that way, easier for moving around with the seasons.

Naturally, the Belhaven lizards rarely (fully) built their own structures, instead making use of what they found already built by whoever came before them, but it was still an interesting thought. 

&quot;If the storytellers are right in their estimations, then we are many, many generations removed from the folk that lived as your people do. Still, we have learned that stone, brick and mortar and beautiful things - but they punish the short-sighted, dim-witted and careless. Those that grow dissatisfied move on, or tear down what they built only to start again.

Though she was half businessing it up with Grask, the invitation to go explore teeny pretty caves did not go unheard, and her attention was drawn towards her friends and pretty glowing lights.

With a flourish and a clap, Cairn bounced, shifting midair until she were a teeny bright green frog, which landed on Ashkri’s shoulder.

Perhaps Grandfather has something in particular he wants, so I will ask him and write to you along with the schematics.&quot; With attention shifting towards the youngest member of the present family, Grask went back to the fire and the food he had been readying before.

On witnessing Cairn&#39;s transformation, Ashkri might as well have exploded with awe. In another life, and another time, he may very well have done exactly that. Thankfully his corporeal form was, as yet, incapable of spontaneous combustion - the light orbs he had conjured, however, did the exploding for him, popping one by one as he stared at the frog formerly known as githyanki. &quot;That&#39;s so <em><strong>cool</strong></em>...&quot; he breathed, hand reaching up to see if the froggy form was indeed real. Cairn would feel the young lizard&#39;s body vibrate with excitement, perhaps leaving room to wonder if this much stimulation was healthy for the creature.

&quot;<em>I did tell him you were capable, but he didn&#39;t believe me until now,</em>&quot; Kaskra wrote, with just the slightest hint of smugness about him as well at finally seeing him proven wrong.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As Clove&#39;s eyes drifted over the active work site, they nodded. &quot;Whenever you want a break from here, we can go! I think the cave should be open for a few more weeks, before the first ice.&quot;

As Cairn transformed into a small frog, Clove grinned, and began a small casting themself. The scent of rich, loamy earth accompanied the swirling greens and browns of Clove&#39;s magic as they fashioned a small hat with druidcraft. Centered on the cap of an acorn that seemed perfectly sized to top Cairn-the-frog&#39;s head was a fantastic diorama of the nature around them. Soft moss lined the inside of the cap for a comfortable fit, and Clove had linked together several sticks to form fearsome looking antlers that sprung from the top. The tiniest of berries decorated a few of the antler&#39;s tips. A smattering of other mosses and tiny, tiny mushrooms sprouted from the antler&#39;s base. 

With a flourish, Clove placed the nature aspected helm gently onto Cairn&#39;s froggy head.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, October 29, 2023 3:19 PM">(edited)</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=whome><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=whome src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/736064160877641819.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>3</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

Even if he hadn&#39;t been Kaskra&#39;s sibling, it&#39;s likely she would have adopted him as part of her family somehow. She let out another ribbit, plapping her little front hands on Ashkri&#39;s shoulder in response to Kaskra&#39;s words since she lacked the ability to speak.

Her big ol eyes blinked wide as she watched Clove work, stretching up just the tiniest bit to receive the delightful little acorn cap. From there she puffed her froggy chest proudly, striking a very distinctive pose. If frogs could grin, hers would be worth a thousand words.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ideally we will finish the above-ground part of this project before the frost arrives. Underground may take longer, depending on how extensive they made their cellar, basement, catacombs or whatever else.</em>&quot; That written, he stepped over to Ashkri to rest a gentle hand on his unoccupied shoulder to steady the youngster and perhaps drag him out of whatever imaginary world he was rapidly retreating into.

Thankfully, it seemed to work. With a start and a quick tongue flick over an eye he looked at the adults around him, then to the frog on his shoulder. &quot;Can I learn to do that?&quot; he asked tentatively, though given his look towards Clove it was clear the question wasn&#39;t directed <em>only</em> at the wild shaper, but also the hat maker. &quot;We don&#39;t have any teachers that can do that back home.&quot; There was the slightest hint of disappointment in his voice, but for the most part it seemed to be a simple statement of fact rather than criticism.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ashkri thumped his tail on the ground as he thought, looking to his hands. How <em>did</em> he do that again? &quot;I dunno. It just kinda happens when I think real hard about it.

Their magic simply <em>was</em>, like breath or blinking, but they had indeed had a teacher. The ponderous look Clove wore evidenced how deeply they were considering the question. And their consideration was not without trepidation... Their family had asked similar questions, fearful of the aspects of Clove&#39;s magic that they didn&#39;t understand (which was most of Clove&#39;s gifts). 

&quot;When I was little, she used to come  visit me in my dreams. Her hair was braids but made of vines and leaves. And she wore bark like patches on her skin, but not always, sometimes her patches were made of water or stone instead. Sometimes she had rams horns, and other times she was small, like a bat with wings. But I always knew her. She didn&#39;t speak, but she led me to the things I needed to cast my spells. She used other words that other people whispered, and carried them on the wind to my ears before she let the words fade away. Talking to her is like listening to a choir. She taught me all that I know. She comes to me less frequently, now, but she told me I was on the right path and that I needed her less.&quot; Here, Clove looked shyly at Kaskra and Cairn, the tangible friends she spent most of her extroverted time with. &quot;But she still visits. I can ask her to come say hi to you, if you&#39;d like? But I think she&#39;d also be ok if you reached for her yourself.&quot;</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=whome><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=whome src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/736064160877641819.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

She shrugged her little froggy shoulders to the best of her ability before hopping off, shifting back into her usual form with a stretch. “I don’t sees why you couldn’t learn!” She chirped confidently.

She turned to Clove as they explained their teacher and her intimidating beauty. Every new word describing her was another checkbox off the list of ‘reliable druid magic advisor’ for Cairn, and she nodded along approvingly with some jealousy in her eyes. “She sounds really cool. If anyone can teaches you how to do magics, she can!”

Chest puffing with pride, she jerked a thumb towards herself with a grin. “Me, I’m mostly self taught. Ol Maggoty taught me about potions and brewing, but down in the swamps is where I really dug mine toes in and started communing with nature. Sometimes it’s all about being <em>immersed</em> in nature.”

She paused before leaning in to stage whisper knowingly  “But don’t go swimmings in quicksand, that’s the wrong kind of immersed. I tried that already, it doesn’t work.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

With a contemplative eye lick, he reached out to give it a touch and hummed. In that moment the family resemblance was palpable - he had the same air around him as Kaskra did when casting from his shadowed tome. That same tug from before was felt by all those present, just the briefest feeling of a breeze floating by, but it was gone as quickly as it came with nothing to show for his concentration. &quot;I don&#39;t get it,&quot; he said simply, shaking his head. &quot;She sounds super nice, though!&quot; he quickly followed up, looking to Clove with what might have been panic at the idea of causing offence. &quot;I&#39;d like to meet her someday, if I can.&quot;

Kaskra did what he did best - took out his notebook to write down what Clove was saying. Something about it stuck with him, but he held the thought as he instead wrote down Cairn&#39;s own experience with her &#39;studies,&#39; such as they were. Both accounts were interesting to him in their own way, and had he the voice to hum thoughtfully as he reread the accounts, he would have. Instead the only sound coming from him for some moments while Ashkri spoke was the light tapping of his pencil on his scaly chin. &quot;<em>I do not believe I have had dream visitors in such a vivid way, so that would be interesting. There has been</em> something <em>of late, but I cannot ever find it. Self-study, at least, is something I know well. There has been little guidance since Rinavera taught me.</em>&quot; 

His reply took a bit longer than normal to write, considering the length and the size of his chalkboard needing him to erase and continue the writing, but he added as an after thought. &quot;<em>Do you still keep the hag&#39;s shack we found in order, Cairn?&quot;</em></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Thursday, November 2, 2023 12:49 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Before coming to Fielbarry, Clove had not known another Druid. Their dream teacher granted them a huge boon at each appearance; because without her Clove&#39;s magical progress would have been much, much slower. Clove thus took great joy in learning more about how Cairn sourced her magics, listening with rapturous attention. Clove wasn&#39;t all that skilled at making potions, but tried to make a mental note that Cairn might be able to help her source some elixirs for a project.

Clove nodded, sagely agreeing with the necessity of being immersed in nature. &quot;It&#39;s why I spend so much of my time wandering the land here,&quot; Clove said into the quiet where Kaska&#39;s pencil tapping echoed softly. &quot;Sometimes when I do, she comes to teach me new spells. The next time she does, I will ask her to come say hello to you all.&quot; As they offered, Clove gave a smile, wondering which form her mentor would take for each of her friends.

Reading Kaskra&#39;s final missive, Clove looked back up to Cairn with a sparkle in their eye. The hag&#39;s house had been the Best Find Ever according to Clove, so they were quite vested in the answer.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In the background, Grask and Shashk had gotten quite far along with the food - which smelled surprisingly good, considering what Cairn and Clove knew of Kaskra&#39;s own dietary prefetences. &quot;Feel free to come and get a bowl, if you like.

Maybe if we goes banging pots and pans in the woods she&#39;ll come finds us.&quot; She grinned.

At Kaskra&#39;s question of the shack her chest puffed proudly, nodding. &quot;I do! It has a nice bed and all of the bones and reagents have been organized and labeled! I&#39;ve also growns the swamp up nicely around it so it is easier to get around. And prettier! Sometimes I goes there to take a nice nap and gather new things to work with.&quot; What things? She didn&#39;t specify.

Especially not as Grask and Shashk called out over the delicious smell of food that began wafting their way.

At the question of Kaskra&#39;s childhood, there was a pause. Grask tapped his chin with a heavy finger, eyeing his younger brother before turning to Clove with a questioning look. &quot;What sort of stories do you want to hear? There are a few you might find humorous, and others that simply tell of the way he was before his run-in with something in the dark. He still has yet to tell us what caused his change.&quot;

Kaskra, for his part, did a decent job at pretending not to be worried at what &#39;secrets&#39; might be revealed by his older siblings.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She leaned in to take a heavy sniff of the food, her stomach rumbling in approval with a grin that faltered at the removal of dairy.

“Oh, you can’t eats dairy?” She asked, sounding momentarily heartbroken and agahst for the poor lizardfolk. Any plans she’d had of introducing them to her local cuisine were dashed almost instantly. Dairy products were like, 80% of her diet back home in the Taiga.

It still smelled good though, and she accepted the bowl eagerly all the same, settling down cross-legged in the dirt near the fire as well before blowing on the bowl a few times. All hesitation melted away instantly and she nodded quickly, toothy grin once again plastered on her face. “Not bad! I likes it. I’ve never had dwarven-lizard soup before, but I thinks this is the best I’ll ever have.”

“What else can’t you eats?” She asked, head tilting a moment. She was determined to find <em>something</em> she could share with them later.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;The more processing involved, the worse it is, usually. Rare will always be best for us, I believe, but living underneath Belhaven has brought us many things we would not have considered otherwise.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Clove&#39;s mind wandered back to the orchard as they ate a few more bites of stew. &quot;I wonder if I could start a mushroom orchard around here. I will take notes when I visit!&quot;

Clove grinned a happy but copiously snaggletoothed smile to Kaskra. After &quot;Silly stories please!&quot; was offered in answer to Grask, Clove gently patted Kaskra on the arm. They hadn&#39;t noticed his worry, per se, but were rather just the type to give comfort generally. &quot;It&#39;s okay, you get to ask my family for silly stories about me too, whenever they come to visit.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

What we do have does seem to work just fine, however, and we have no end of donations from the less savoury elements of the city to make up for what we lack.&quot;

Grask hummed, folding heavy arms across his chest as he sat back, thinking. What would be appropriately humorous for their guests? His younger brother certainly had no shortage of mishaps in his adolescence, but some may be a touch too intense for the prevailing mood of the evening. He sat as still as the stone he worked with, only stirring when he finally settled on one with a nod. &quot;As you may know, our people live underneath Belhaven, and much of what we need is, frankly, stolen from those that would not miss it.&quot; He motioned over to Kaskra, &quot;I do not know how much he has indulged old habits while in Fielbarry, but back home he was fairly prolific in his pursuit of valuables that the Families valued. One such valuable was a small pearl-and-gold crown from a merchant that had carved a space for themselves in the market seemingly overnight.&quot;

At that, Kaskra shifted a bit, pulling his cloak around himself as if attempting to hide. Any facade of being unbothered was shattered with the mention of the crown, and his tail curled tight around his waist.

&quot;Our little brother fancied himself a master thief, even at ten, and to his credit he <em>did</em> do as much planning as a youngster could manage at the time. What he did not account for, however, was two things: the fact that another thief had the same plan as him to get into the good graces of one of the Families, and the fact that windows are generally not made with the intention of allowing others to climb through - let alone someone with a large tail.&quot; He paused, glancing at Kaskra with what might have been amusement, then continued.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1176204387312484463 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1176204387312484463><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, November 20, 2023 9:56 AM">9:56 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;He went at night, tools tucked into his working belt. He got in, made it to the room and collided head first with the other thief that had snuck in as well as he rushed towards his prize. Thankfully for him, we are blessed with rather sturdy skulls, and elves... are less so.&quot; To illustrate, he smacked his hands together with a heavy &#39;thump,&#39; just in case the point was lost. &quot;The thief was out cold, but the noise had been enough to alert a patrolling mansion guard to come and investigate. According to my brother, he managed to wedge the other thief against the door in a way that made it rather difficult to open from the outside, as it swung into the room, and he set about finding another way out. That&#39;s where the window came in - big enough for the slender elf, and, in the head of a young lizard, surely big enough for him as well. Not quite so, as it turned out. His recent shed should have been enough to let him know he had grown larger that he was used to, but he tried his luck and was wedged by the tail.&quot;

Shashk, for her part, had decided that this needed visual aid beyond what Grask&#39;s words could provide. She produced a scroll from her pocket, recited the words and flicked it towards the fire. The fire promptly burst into the image of a much younger Kaskra stuck in a window, squirming this way and that to try and squeeze his way through the small window.

&quot;Thank you, sister. It is only right that our guests see what Mother allowed us to see, as well. Our little brother tried whatever he could think of to squeeze out, but only when the guard managed to kick the door down did an opportunity present itself. The guard grabbed our brother, who then used the guard as a kickboard to launch himself through the window. He broke his tail in half in the process, but it worked.&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, November 20, 2023 9:57 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1176204419461828749 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1176204419461828749><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, November 20, 2023 9:56 AM">9:56 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>And the image shifted, showing a rather angry armed guard kicking in a door to grab the young lizard by the legs and pull him back, only for the lizard to kick against him, propel himself forward into the window frame and through, falling down from a third story window, through the branches of illusory trees and into a bush, where he lay unmoving. Safe to say, the tail snap and fall was enough to knock out the poor lizard.

&quot;Mother had already sent two of our other siblings to fetch him, so we were close enough to haul him out of the bushes and back home before the guards could search for him. He managed to secure the crown, thankfully, but it took months for his tail to heal properly - and we never quite let him live down forgetting just how fat his tail had gotten.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Eventually the shaking in her shoulders was too much and she set the bowl down in her lap, wheezing out a laugh while pointing a shaky finger in Kaskra’s general direction. “You losts your tail! Big ol fat tail! Hah!”

It perhaps <em>wasn’t</em> the nicest thing to do, laughing at your friends, and to her credit she attempted to wrangle in her wheezing with a few clears of her throat, wiping the tears from her eyes. “I didn’t even know your tails <em>could</em> grow back, that’s so cool!
