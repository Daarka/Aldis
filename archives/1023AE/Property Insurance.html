Winter still lingered over Fielbarry, though occasionally, spring tried to push through with the odd rain shower—though snow was more common. This of course meant that when there was rainfall, the result was miserably slushy terrain for a little while.

Valkyn… didn’t actually mind having a bit of a job to do. It gave him some loose sense of purpose, where he otherwise would have felt unpleasantly adrift. He split his time between being indoors with Hiraeth, and lounging outside the little cottage as a hulking beast, laying as motionless as a boulder for sometimes hours on end. More recently, this often left him fully covered in whatever snow was falling, with the only oddity being the way the snow instantly dissolved on his ichorous eye socket upon contact, resulting in a black void that never gathered snow like the rest of his form.

But it was not currently snowing. Far less pleasantly, it was drizzling frigid rainfall over the aberrant beast who presently laid on the ground flanking the cottage, equally motionless as he was during more agreeable weather. It was impossible to say if he was cold, really; he had no fur or obvious means of keeping warm, but he also was not in the anatomy of a mammal, nor any beast from the material plane. If he did find the icy rain toe-numbingly miserable, there was no indication of it whatsoever.

He had laid himself down on the western side of the cottage—it positioned the cottage directly between himself and the greenhouse, but it was a place that allowed him to more easily watch the sunset; something he did not have the ability to take for granted at this point in his life. And so, between the absence of line of sight and the dull pattering of light but steady rainfall, he wasn’t immediately aware of the figure that had slunk towards the greenhouse, staying in the shadows as they subtly investigated until the structure’s door was located, brushing aside the foliage hiding it and producing a set of thin iron tools as the door’s lock was uncovered.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But that&#39;s what it took to make sure the amber whiplash flourished, and so it had to be. Hiraeth hobbled through the greenhouse, tending to the various plants and harvesting bundles of herbs, placing them in a wicker basket as he mindfully snipped them. Humming a tune to himself as he worked, the little flame on his tail tip keeping a cozy light around him, he also missed the sound of tools picking at the lock on the door.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A second individual, a dark-skinned elf, met his gaze, then looked through the vines and glass panes and towards the movement that had caught his companion&#39;s attention. He watched for only a moment, before looking back to the half-orc and wordlessly drawing two daggers in reply. The elf then looked over <em>his</em> shoulder, giving a small jerk of his chin to yet a third figure further back in the trees; smaller than the others, the last stranger was a human woman who seemed to be lingering farther behind the other two. At the silent gesture from the elf, she gave him a bit of a long look, before dipping further back into the trees, further withdrawing from whatever was about to happen. With this seeming to be what he had been intending, the elf looked back to the half-orc and nodded. 

The half-orc... looked a little more apprehensive than the others. But evidently not apprehensive enough to fail to comply, and with a low exhale, he returned to picking the lock as quietly as possible.

When it unlatched successfully, he tucked the tools away, drawing out a long dagger of his own, and delicately pulling the lock off of the door without clanking it against the latch. Setting it aside on the ground, he took a deep breath with a hand resting on the door--before surging into action. Shoving it open, he darted inside, headed straight for the tiefling within, with every intention of grappling him as quickly as possible to subdue him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His leg spasmed at the motion, and he would have fallen if the half-orc hadn&#39;t grabbed him, head thrown back and teeth gritted in pain. He twisted in the half-orc&#39;s hold, and then thrashed his head, trying to catch the half-orc with the tines of his antler-like horns, or even just concuss him with a good whack.

There were too many spells in his repertoire that solely had to do with fire, and he very quickly realized that he absolutely could not use any of them, because if the amber whiplash went up in smoke, so would the spore, and inhaling that would be... bad. Extremely so. If he didn&#39;t die outright he&#39;d become addicted.

But the tiefling-inherent gifts of thaumaturgy had their uses too, and the normally soft-spoken man&#39;s voice boomed from his throat in a yell thrice as loud as he was normally capable of.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But those centuries had also been filled with his only sources of true protein coming from his time spent as an ambush predator. And he was just as accustomed to sitting in one place and doing virtually nothing for long periods as he was accustomed to <em>looking</em> like he was doing virtually nothing for long periods, yet being on a hair trigger the entire time.

Hiraeth had barely stopped yelling before a dark, massive shape suddenly blotted out the light from the entrance into the greenhouse, accompanied by bone-rattling wave of deep, alien rumbling sounds. But his maw did not jut into the greenhouse in pursuit of the half-orc; instead, he snapped his jaws closed around the torso of the elf, while his excessively long tail simultaneously whipped through the doorway like the strike of a viper, fixing its talons around the man trying to restrain Hiraeth.

That man--fortunately--instinctively recoiled at the new arrival, his endeavor to grab hold of Hiraeth abandoned in favor of self preservation. The half-orc released what he had grabbed of the tiefling, and got two steps away from him before Valkyn&#39;s tail snagged him, looping around him once and sinking those talons securely into him, before beginning the process of dragging him back out of the greenhouse.

Which he probably could have done effortlessly, but... seemed to be taking a bit slower so that he didn&#39;t knock things over in the process.

The elf, meanwhile, had yelped sharply as Valkyn&#39;s maw closed around him, but... from what Hiraeth could hear, he was still very much making sounds, and so probably had not been snapped in half.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Do you mind holding them while I reach out to Jaska? He&#39;ll want to interrogate them.&quot;

He limped off after the aberration, pulling a sending stone out of his pocket. <em>&#39;Jaska, two people just attempted to break into the greenhouse. Valkyn has them restrained. I assume you wish to interrogate them?&#39;</em>


Jaska trailed off mid-sentence with Valentine at the bar, pausing as he listened to the words, then pursing his lips into a thin line. <em>&#39;I&#39;ll be there soon.&#39;</em> Pushing himself down off his stool, he grabbed for his coat and pulled it on. &quot;I have to go interrogate a couple of idiots who broke into the greenhouse.

The only thing seemingly out of character from him was his lack of swooping in to help get Hiraeth back to his feet--but given the circumstances, he seemed to have his metaphorical hands full. Both men he had grabbed continued to struggle, though the half-orc had dropped his weapon in the scuffle, and the elf had one arm trapped inside Valkyn&#39;s mouth. He was very strong in this form, easily capable of restraining two men, but it was still something that required his full attention and effort--especially since he was... not actually biting down on the elf. Consciously holding back from doing so.

Hiraeth had just heard the last of Jaska&#39;s response, when the aberration gave a sharp, loud squeal of a sound, like a hellish, alien feline had been jabbed with a fork. His head jerked upwards, his grip on the elf loosening momentarily, before clamping back down again with that same <em>conscious</em> restraint that seemed to be even more difficult to achieve than it was before. His head did not lower again, the thick muscles on his neck as tense and tightly-strung as if they were made of iron, some reflexive instinct driving him to pull his head up as if to remove himself from a hazard. There was another jerk of his head, accompanied by another unsettling, sharp exclamation of a sound from him a few seconds later, and he seemed to be trying <em>very hard</em> not to shake the elf like a dog with a ragdoll, as a trickle of dark crimson began to seep out from between his teeth.


Val blinked, a brow raising. &quot;... Well that sounds much more interesting than this. It&#39;s slow enough tonight, I&#39;ll let Eve know the bar needs attention,&quot; she agreed easily, setting down what she had been doing and dusting off her hands, stepping around the bar to join Jaska. &quot;Who am I to decline free entertainment?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Valkyn&#39;s rumbling snarls heightened, and he recoiled to bring the man out of range of Hiraeth, before sharply whipping his head to forcefully pelt the elf into the ground as he spit him out, swiftly followed up by his claws slamming down into him, one pinning either arm into the icy ground. The elf had--somehow--managed to maintain his hold on both of his daggers, but with the full weight of Valkyn&#39;s front half pressing down on his arms... there wasn&#39;t much he could <em>do</em> with them. 

With the dagger now removed from the roof of Valkyn&#39;s mouth, blood flowed freely between his teeth, dripping down on to the elf as the beast loomed (harmlessly) over him, the rumbling and alien clicking sounds coming from him deep enough to make the ground under him shiver with their vibrations. 

But this seemed to more or less nullify the threat, as both men were now unable to do much but uselessly struggle and grit their teeth at the monster holding them. And after a moment of establishing that no further antics were about to transpire, Valkyn&#39;s head lifted a fraction to turn his singular eye towards Hiraeth instead, looking over him critically.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He staggered a bit and shook his head, dazed, but as Valkyn looked him over, he offered him a smile. &quot;I&#39;m fine. Nothing serious. Open up, let me see your mouth.&quot;

Reaching up, he cradled Valkyn&#39;s head lightly in his hands, mindful to avoid any of the ichor from his missing eye. Provided he didn&#39;t fuss about it, he&#39;d examine where the bleeding was coming from, and stick his hand fearlessly into his mouth to cast a healing spell over the wounds.

There was a single, though messy stab wound up into the roof of his mouth, in what had honestly been a very wise attempt from the elf to try to get the monster to release him. It did technically succeed in getting him spit out.


Jaska arrived with Val on his arm, though she released him (after hitching a ride on his vision) once they reached their destination, allowing him to do as he pleased without her attached to him. His daughter did not have her knives with her, having been in no way prepared for such an encounter, and the weather was very disagreeable to her--but kept all of that to herself as she usually did, looking over the two strangers without really <em>looking</em> at them, her attention landing on the two daggers the elf still defiantly clung to.

The men both turned their attention to the new arrivals (as much as they were able to, given their restraints) with unimpressed grimness. Nothing but dry silence came in the wake of Jaska&#39;s question, with neither seeming keen on volunteering an explanation.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I regret to say I didn&#39;t bring you any goodies this time, we left too briskly for me to think to grab something from the kitchen. Hopefully this hasn&#39;t been an egregious inconvenience?&quot;

Finding the situation between Jaska, the strangers, and the aberrant monster more familiar territory than the pleasantries between Val and Hiraeth, Axa trailed after her father, not looking the least bit disturbed by Valkyn&#39;s form. It was the first time she had encountered it directly, but not the first time she had seen it at all--but even if it was, it... took quite a bit more than a corrupted druid to give her the heebie jeebies.

The elf glared icily at Jaska at his threat, seeming to hesitate a moment as he weighed his options. But Valkyn wasn&#39;t polite enough to wait for him to fully respond before heeding Jaska&#39;s request to take things inside, and so as the elf hesitated, Valkyn&#39;s teeth closed around his torso again, claws shifting away so he could be lifted up with his shoulder and upper body pinned between rows of otherworldly fangs. 

Reflexively, the elf hissed, and struck out to crudely sink both daggers into the sides of Valkyn&#39;s muzzle, wedging them as deep as he could manage given the awkward positioning with how he was restrained, as well as the innate toughness of Valkyn&#39;s hide. There was another violent squeal from the aberration, who gave the elf a sharp--but restrained--shake, briefly opening and then quickly closing his jaws again to reposition his grip on the man&#39;s body so that it better trapped his arms.

The elf did technically drop his daggers, though they now sat buried in Valkyn&#39;s face as the beast rumbled all sorts of unhappy noises, dragging the half-orc in his tail unceremoniously across the ground as he stalked back towards the front door of the cottage, squeezing himself and his hostages inside with a bit of difficulty.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Jaska hummed as he looked around Hiraeth and Valkyn&#39;s tiny cabin. He went to grab the two chairs from the tiny table, setting them out and instructing Valkyn to dump them into the chairs one at a time so he could restrain and tie them up, and search them for any remaining weapons. &quot;Where would you like me to start? I can go easy at first, insert needles up under your nails, burn the bottoms of your feet, that sort of thing. Or I can go hard, and let my daughter play around with you.&quot;

He looked over to Axa. &quot;I will need you to keep them alive for the time being, and they will need to be able to speak. I trust that would give you plenty of leeway?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

With blood now trickling down his muzzle from the knives embedded there, his tail slithered around to grip its digits around the hilt of one dagger, before yanking it out with a shuddering sound of pain. Dropping it carelessly, he repeated the process to the other dagger, which clanked down on top of its twin as it, too, was dropped.

And then his form began to slough, and a moment later, the drow was standing there instead, his face no longer wounded but still streaked in blood—and ichor that had begun to run without his eyepatch.

No sooner was he back in his true form than he was speaking, aggressively spitting undercommon at the two strangers in a tone and inflection that sounded like a proper chewing out.

He was in the middle of a sentence when the elf interrupted him. “You’re wasting your breath. I don’t speak <em>crick</em>,” he sneered dryly. 

That shut Valkyn up, as if he had been slapped across the face. His eye widened slightly, jaw clenching as he straightened his back, drawing into the posture of a <em>very</em> indignant noble for a moment. But whatever was going through his mind, he seemed to decide after a moment it wasn’t worth it, and with a last, narrowed look, he turned to head for the bathroom to clean his face.

Throughout all this, Jaska had the unique boon of his sister’s voice in his mind. <em>’He is, in fact, shaming them for attacking him given the apparent restraint he was practicing. I believe he just called them ungrateful. His dialect is strange.’</em> 

She paused as the wood elf shot back at him, and then her voice in Jaska’s mind was <em>rich</em>. <em>’If I’m not terribly mistaken… this gentleman just pulled a slur card.’</em>

As she communicated it all, she had stepped over to Axa, leaning down to whisper in her ear. The girl didn’t look at her, but gave a small, “<em>Ja,</em>” to which Val replied with simply a brief rub on her shoulder, before returning to where Hiraeth stood—having hitched a ride on the devil’s truesight.

Following Valkyn’s little outburst, Axa’s attention shifted back to her father, and she gave a small, expressionless nod.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Jaska clicked his tongue. &quot;We&#39;re going to be rude, I see.

But Jaska knew her well enough to catch it, to see the way the quiet stress of confusion melted away. 

Sometimes she just needed things spelled out for her.

That established, she turned back to regard the elf, the tip of her tail curling a little in what might have been contemplation. 

The elf didn’t seem concerned for his safety, evidently finding her hesitation to be a sign of mousieness, a sign she didn’t have the guts for the task. His eyes were slightly lidded as he lazily sized her up. “Didn’t think the brazen <em>Jaska Piotovich</em> would delegate his dirty work to toddlers,” he snorted. “What’s the matter, princess? Havin’ trouble with the life of a child soldier?”

If his words did anything to Axa, she made no show of it. As he spoke, she stepped forward, and unceremoniously crawled up onto his lap, her clawed toes digging those little talons into him to secure her perch on his thighs. The elf’s leg still bled from the gouge in it where Hiraeth’s antler tine had scored into him, and so her nimble but unhurried climb onto him elicited a faint wince. 

“… Am I supposed to find this cute? You—“

He cut off as the barb of Axa’s tail sank slowly into the open wound in his calf, jolting and hissing in a sharp breath of pain. Axa merely sat perched on his knees, staring emotionlessly at his face as the barb dug deeper, beginning to pump venom into him that rapidly escalated his shock of pain into waves of roiling agony, as the elf abandoned speech in favor of trying in vain to kick the child off of him, giving strangled grunts with each wave of searing pain.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But he still relented no information, despite the heavy sweat he had quickly broken into as the venom began to spread. 

After a few more moments of this, Axa’s tail extracted itself from his wound, the rat-like appendage now smeared in blood. It wasn’t quite a relief from pain for the elf, of course, as the venom did not leave with the barb, but it was probably a marginal improvement, as he went from choked noises of pained cries to more muted grunts of suffering. 

In that momentary pseudo-relief, the elf managed only to growl a low, “I am not afraid of pain… Nor death. You cannot… do anything to me that matters… It all feeds the beast…”

Axa continued to stare at him a moment longer, still with no expression on her face. Then her little hands lifted to grab either side of his face, pushing it so he would look at her, despite her own gaze not quite meeting his eyes. Her voice was again soft and meek, though as she spoke, it bled into something warped, echoing in on itself as if every syllable was supplemented with the cries of the damned.

“The beast has already forgotten you,” she said emotionlessly, her eyes gradually blacking out, as similarly black veins spread from them across her skin. “You are forsaken.”

The elf’s breath stilled, stunned by her words and the unsettling changes rapidly overtaking her. But he didn’t have much time to process it, as her little claws abruptly sank into his eyes, gouging her fingers with complete disregard behind his eyeballs to begin messily clawing them out as he flailed and screamed.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
