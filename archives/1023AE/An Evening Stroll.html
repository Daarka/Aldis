Whether it was the delicious wine, an evening where she felt a sense of connection like she hadn&#39;t in many years, or a heady combination of both, Cain was thanking Tymora that her winding road had ended up in Fielbarry.

With the same casual grace that she did everything, she upended the bottle, draining it but reserving any solid sediment at the bottom. In an interior pocket on her vest, she rummaged until finding her flask. She gave it a perfunctory shake, and found it full enough in the event that they wanted more drink later. She grinned, flashing her teeth at Yarrow as she repocketed it and began pulling him towards the door. She gave a cheeky wave to the creature with the mandibles on the way out, having sensed several looks exchanged between the creature and Yarrow.

Having made it outside, Cain took a bracing breath of the night air before turning her gaze back to Yarrow. &quot;A stroll with a fine companion indeed. I confess I&#39;m new enough to town that I&#39;ve no destination in mind. I am... open to suggestions on where this night should take us.&quot; The look she directed at him simmered with potential.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Everything else was just icing on the cake as far as he was concerned, and he was determined to lick up every inch of it and enjoy himself in complete hedonism.

He similarly sucked in some much-needed nighttime air, the arm around Cain&#39;s waist shifting to hook a thumb around a stray belt or the hem of her pants; nothing so far as to end the fun early, but in a playfully possessive way. He gave a mocking bow from his comfortable place by her side at the compliment and reigns to direct their mosey, a hand raising to cup his chin thoughtfully. The arm around her waist gave a gentle squeeze, guiding her to follow along down a seemingly random road of his choosing.

&quot;Oh, where to begin? I must&#39;ve walked the length of this city multiple times by now. The guild grounds, that&#39;s familiar, boring. Cute little neighborhoods all around, plenty of parties to join if you play your cards right. I personally quite enjoy the bathhouse. The brewery&#39;s a <em>delight,</em> though I can&#39;t imagine it&#39;s open this time of night. We might be able to give a little tour if we&#39;re quite polite and quiet, though.&quot; Yarrow mused, head leaning in gently towards Cain in a quiet sing-song voice meant only for her ears.

&quot;Of course, there&#39;s fountains, parks, even woods outside the city limits if a little bushes is your thing.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A smile played at her lips. It had been a long time since she&#39;d done this with anyone quite so <em>fun</em>.

At the mention of woods, she blinked her eyes open and smothered a laugh, earnest in the effort to not wake the sleepy houses around them. &quot;Only just arrived back in town, and you&#39;re so eager to go camping again.&quot; She gave his shoulder an affectionate bump as she teased.

She looked around, enjoying how the moonlight filtered through town, drenching the street in shadows. Cain loved how the town looked at night. She spoke quietly back at Yarrow. &quot;I wonder what is open this late... A tour until something strikes our fancy sounds lovely.&quot; 

Cain tilted her head to look at Yarrow through her eyelashes, her eyes wide with pretend innocence. &quot;And I can do quiet, but I hope you didn&#39;t get me all alone to ask me to be polite.&quot; She&#39;d shifted her tone to a lilting pattern that matched Yarrow&#39;s sing-song as she smiled demurely.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Though their path seemed to snake at random, the occasional garden there, a fountain there, a fondly-crafted sculpture poised in a window all at the very least gave them something pleasant to look at as they walked through town.

He gave her a wink and a grin at her tease, returning the shoulder bump. &quot;I am nothing if not accommodating to your desires. Who am I to say I&#39;ve had enough of the trees if that&#39;s what suits your fancy? There&#39;s not too much open this late.. mostly taverns and bars. Gambling too, if you wanted to test your luck even more with games.&quot;

A naughty chuckle escaped him at her mock innocence, giving a shake of his head. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t dream of asking you to be polite to me.&quot; He leaned in to press his lips close to her ear, breath warm and inviting in whisper. &quot;Though if I were to have my way, I&#39;d like to hear just how loud we can get.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I confess that I do most of my traveling at night when I&#39;m alone. My old guild trained us to take advantage of darkness, and that&#39;s been a difficult habit to break. There&#39;s something so peaceful about the world at this hour.&quot; She gazed at the sleeping town around them as they ambled.

At the mention of gambling and games, Cain let out a rueful chuckle. &quot;I&#39;ve never felt odds less in my favor than when chatting with that spindly devil...&quot; She shook her head as if to remove Ezekiel from her thoughts, and focused on the alluring Yarrow whispering into her ear. She shivered, a frisson of anticipation running through her spine, and continued with a grin that was positively sinful, &quot;It&#39;s a pity the bathhouse isn&#39;t open, though.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At the very least, he enjoyed traversing it with his current companion; often his solo sojourns through town were after failed attempts at staying in someone else&#39;s bed, and though they were pleasant, they often had that sting of disappointment lingering. Not tonight, though. The walk kept him from wallowing in stupor, and Cain&#39;s presence kept the gears in the backburner of his mind turning on far more pleasant things than solitude this evening.

&quot;I do. Often, when sleep eludes me, or I elude it, I find myself just walking through town. Sometimes if I&#39;m lucky, the moon will illuminate stray coins just ripe for the taking.&quot; He said. Ever the opportunist when it came to gold. He had to be, considering his current chosen lifestyle.

<em>It&#39;s a pity,</em> and he grinned anew, gently steering them down a different street. &quot;I think the pair of us can be quite convincing with the right unlatched window. At least a key isn&#39;t-&quot;

He groaned, a bit of the playful candor dropping as he remembered the fate of his lockpicking tools. &quot;I can&#39;t believe so soon I&#39;m faced with the consequences of that fairy&#39;s trade for sleep... I mean, I&#39;d do it again in a heartbeat, but at the very least I&#39;d liked to have made it a week before losing my lockpicks meant something.&quot;

He gave her a sly, almost hopeful look. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t happen to have lockpicks, would you?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I don’t think I’ve ever seen so many lockpick kits in one place.” She paused her steps, the halt pulling her partially out of Yarrow’s grasp as she absentmindedly patted herself and began fishing through pockets. “Now where did I put those…”

After a few seconds of searching, Cain swore under her breath. In the middle of the street as they were, she didn’t have anywhere to put stuff as she rooted through her vest pockets. She cupped Yarrow’s hands together in front of her. “Hold things,” she demanded quietly, and began turning several pockets inside out in the hunt for her thieves’ tools. Into his waiting hands, Cain proceed to pile a few vials filled with unknown liquids, a jar of pills with a black wax seal, the silver drinking flask Yarrow had shared with Cain on the road, a coil of thin wire that glinted in the moonlight, something that was surely a disguise kit… 

Before Yarrow could study the items further, Cain muttered a gleeful “Got you, you bastard!” as she pulled out a well oiled leather pouch, also placing it in Yarrow’s hands. She collected everything else and began filing things back into her pockets. As she was getting re-situated, she spoke softly to Yarrow.

“I’d be a piss-poor former member of-” and her eyes glinted as she bit back her next word before continuing, “-shall we say, a guild that operates mostly at night, if I couldn’t let myself into a locked door or two.” She left the tools in Yarrow’s hand as she continued her thought, “I admit that I am not very good at it, though. You’re welcome to borrow my kit tonight.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His head cocked slightly to the side as she cursed, though his attention moved to his hands as she guided them together for her benefit. <em>Well.</em> With a demand like that, who was he to object?

<em>&quot;Yes ma&#39;am.~&quot;</em> He purred, standing obediently as a bipedal shelf for her to deposit all her goodies on - much to the delight of his curiosity. Questions rose with each new delightful item, eyes glinting at the half-built leaps his mind immediately made from such an unfinished story. He opened his mouth, his questions interrupted by her success. Pocketing the thoughts for later with a chuckle, he eagerly exchanged the kit for her goodies.

His hands curled affirmatively around the kit and he nodded at her offer. Tucking it within the confines of his shirt and into the lip of the many wraps around his waist, his hands were free once again to slide back around her and resume their mosey.

&quot;Thank you <em>kindly,</em> Cain. I dare say we might be able to make our midnight reservation after all.&quot;

Familiarity guided the pair through the streets once again until the bathhouse loomed before them. Something may have looked off at first until realization set in; naturally, he&#39;d taken them straight to the rear of the building. There wasn&#39;t a need for them to view the front at this time of night, after all. He paused in the shadow of a nearby building briefly, squinting into the night to check for any other midnight pedestrians that might impede their amusement.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She wouldn&#39;t <em>give</em> information away, but she wasn&#39;t opposed to answering a question or two. She gave a small bow when he mentioned making their midnight reservation, laughing quietly as the pair fell back in step with one another.

As Yarrow slid his arm back around her, Cain absent-mindedly ran her fingers over his hand at her hip, drawing abstract patterns. Her eyes sparked with entertainment at their new mission; it had been <em>far</em> too long since she&#39;d done something impulsive like this. The same energy that led her to say yes to Yarrow&#39;s offer for the evening buoyed her now, and she almost had a skip to her step as they enacted the next phase of their mischief.

After Yarrow led them unerringly to the rear door of the bathhouse, Cain leaned close to his ear and whispered. &quot;You seem to be practiced at this. Do you sneak into bathhouses often?&quot; Her voice still lilted with their sing-song from earlier, easy and affectionate. 

When they drew closer, Cain quieted, following Yarrow&#39;s lead and looking around the street for anyone who might spot them. Communicating through hand signs as only a slightly intoxicated scoundrel can, she attempted to ask if he wanted to pick the lock while she kept watch.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

From a casual distance Yarrow looked a (relatively) normal man, but up close he had a faint texture that almost seemed like he&#39;d been molded from a collection of vines not unlike the few that sprung free of his hair, pressed down into the shape of a man. Thankfully, other than the singular line of thorns crawling up his forearm, the rest seemed obediently pressed into shape without a chance to snag.

He grinned at Cain&#39;s question in their approach, giving her little more than a waggle of his brows before turning his attention to their sneaky entrance. It was like breaking into Ghalasine all over again in a way. Seeing no one else, he looked back and nodded at her hand signals, gesturing for the pair to sneak forward into the shadow near the rear.

He sidled up close to an opportune window, giving it a test first in case it were already unlocked. The quiet tut that escaped him told it indeed was locked. Thankfully Cain&#39;s kit proved useful, lockpicks twisting delicately under his hands. Drunk in the dark and decidedly distracted by her, it took him longer than it perhaps should have, but the gentle <em>click</em> of the window was reward enough.

He gently tugged the window open, giving a small bow with gleaming eye. <em>Ladies first,</em> his expression suggested.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She kept a sharp eye on the street around them, hearing nothing but the quiet sounds of the evening. Her hand rested on Yarrow&#39;s back as he worked, as if to locate him while her gaze was elsewhere. The small sounds of metal clinking as he eased the lock open caused her to turn back to him eagerly.

As he cracked the window open, a matching gleam entered Cain&#39;s eye. Her eyes flashed with <em>something</em> that Yarrow might remember from the Duke&#39;s treasure room. She opened her senses, looking for any magic that might have triggered when the window opened. Sensing nothing beyond the mundane locks they&#39;d already overcome, Cain squeezed his shoulder in thanks before moving gracefully through the window into the dark room beyond.

She blinked, standing in the dark, still mildly intoxicated and unable to see very far without a source of light. 

&quot;I can&#39;t see for shit,&quot; she spoke in a low pitch that ended in a bit of a giggle, trying to keep her voice from carrying out the window.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His wine-addled mind hadn&#39;t considered the possibility of magic trappings or anything of the like being added since his previous self-made tour of the place... He let out a small breath he hadn&#39;t realized he&#39;d held when she gave his shoulder a squeeze and slipped inside. Without so much as a second glance to their surroundings, he slipped in after her.

He chuckled at her confession, tugging the window back to a closed position before both hands snaked around her waist from behind, his chin nestling on a shoulder. What moonlight had previously filtered into the building from the window was once more snuffed back to darkness. Not that it seemed to bother him. &quot;Oh, can&#39;t see in the dark, can you?&quot; He asked in a sing-song whisper. &quot;Let me help you with that.&quot;

A hand tugged free of her waist, briefly brushing along her stomach as it twisted in a palm-up flourish. With a whispered word, a small flame appeared flickering in his hand, bringing some definition to the room they stood in. A store room, it seemed, with oils and towels and cleaning things all carefully stowed for later use. Though the room wasn&#39;t one of the baths themselves, the humidity from the nearby water was just tangible in the air, along with the warmth from another room. In the silence of the night, even the sound of running water was unmistakable.

&quot;Now... were you looking for a cold bath, a warm bath, or a <em>hot</em> bath? They have options, you know.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

This analytic train of thought derailed as Yarrow appeared into the space right behind her.

Cain practically purred as Yarrow wrapped his arms around her. She laid her hand on top of his, at least until he moved to illuminate the room. The warmth his touch burned across her stomach on the way up caused her to utter another pleased hum. With a gentle touch she replaced her hand on his at her waist, and perfunctorily scanned the room before she turned her full attention back to Yarrow.

Cain tapped her fingers on her chin thoughtfully, leaning her head back to rest on Yarrow as she mused. &quot;Cold or hot, I think. I tend to prefer the extremes. I might lean hot, after the journey we&#39;ve had. I feel like I have ash everywhere.&quot; The last was said with a wry honesty. 

&quot;Is hot a problem for...&quot; her voice trailed off, but she a moved her hand to Yarrow&#39;s forearm and carefully, almost reverently, ran a finger over one of the thorns.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He could neither fault her logic nor wanted to; a hot bath after their long venture was well needed and most welcomed. &quot;No, not a problem at all. I wouldn&#39;t want a cold bath to make you think <em>less</em> of me anyways.&quot; He said mischievously.

The thorn flexed lightly under her touch, less as a conscious thing and more of a simple reaction. He let out a quavering exhale from the delicate touch, a small pleased sound in the back of his throat. He turned his head from its resting place to plant a singular smooch along her jaw before slipping free. Just enough to reach his other arm out to snag a pair of towels for them, at least, not inclined to be far from her side for long.

With a beckoning motion beneath his makeshift light, he sauntered into the baths with confidence of their corridors, guiding them right past one large room to another. Tossing the towels over his shoulder, he opened the door with a flourishing bow, once more allowing her in first.

The humidity and warmth in the air grew instantly as the door opened. The walls were modestly grand, decorated with some intent to give the room a pleasing look while not breaking the bank. Moonlight lit the space from a small privacy-glass window on the far wall near the ceiling, with accenting lighting fixtures off in the buildings off-hours. The bath was wide, hot, and inviting, and there was plenty of seating within and without the baths to easily conjure visions of its usual occupancy during the day if one cared. Yarrow didn&#39;t. He had far more important people to think of at the moment.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She&#39;d also considered a hot bath more conducive to where she wanted this evening to go.

Cain noted Yarrow&#39;s reaction to the touch, filing that information away with a small smile. In truth, she found the thorns to be quite alluring, and wondered whether the bramblelike structures in his hair would elicit the same reaction. Before she could test, Yarrow&#39;s lips on her jaw caused her pulse to jump to meet him, and she let out a strangled moan as he pulled away in the direction of the shelves.

Bereft of his closeness, Cain instinctively moved in Yarrow&#39;s wake, chasing contact. She grabbed an extra towel for her long hair, and a few oils and soaps at random. Necessary logistics acquired, it was Cain who stepped behind Yarrow this time. She slipped her free hand around his chest, ending with her palm flat on his sternum as she gave a one armed hug. She trailed her hand down to his waist, linking into the fabric there as a point of connection before following his confident stride through the corridors.

&quot;Such a gentleman,&quot; she teased, voice low and sultry as she stepped into the moonlight room. Eyes quickly taking in the scene, Cain was content to leave the accent lighting off. The moonlight was enough for her eyes to adjust, and she looked over at Yarrow, appreciative of how the soft night light lit his features.

&quot;We are geniuses; this is the best idea...&quot; and she fished her flask out as she continued, &quot;I vote we share a bit of this, wash the road off each other, and then I can show you the lovely room I&#39;ve rented at the guild.&quot; She finished her statement with a joking leer, and took a swig of said flask before offering it in Yarrow&#39;s direction.

She piled her towels and soap at the edge of the water, scanning the labels. The soap had a fragrant lemongrass scent that had become more prominent in the humidity. She turned the functional but beautiful hair oil vial around in her hand contemplatively.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her hand inside his shirt had spread a warmth under the skin, and he craved more. He gave a pleased grin as she pulled out the flask and suggested an itinerary for their evening, finding it completely agreeable. Accepting the flask, he lifted a pinky and gave it a wiggle. &quot;That sounds like an <em>excellent</em> idea. I second this motion.. and the motion passes, 2 to 0. Cheers~&quot;

He gave the flask a hearty sip before offering it back, depositing his towels with hers. He leaned in close again, both to brush against her and peep at the labels. &quot;Mmm, good choice. Manage to snag any lavender or sandalwood?&quot;

Regardless of the scents at their disposal, the slight jingle of <em>things</em> came from his direction. He had, after all, a plethora of things in his own pockets, or at the very least, tucked up within the confines of his many scarves and wraps. Very few of them were things that he wanted to bring with him into the water on a normal day, let alone into the welcoming waters with such an attractive companion. Daggers, rapier, Cain&#39;s lockpick kit, ropes, a coinpurse (or two)... All tossed aside onto one of the nearby lounge seats with lackadaisical casualness in favor of slowly unwrapping his scarves, his already-loose shirt starting to hang more with each belt and binding removed.

&quot;Want any help with that?&quot; He asked innocently. Was that about the shampoo, or the hair oil? <em>yes.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Cain left the flask over by the bath and joined Yarrow at the lounge chairs. If there were chairs, there might be- she spotted a row of clean bathrobes hanging on one side of the room, should they be interested later. Although, as their visit was… unsanctioned, it might be better not to linger overlong.

The clatter of the interior of Yarrow&#39;s pockets drew her attention. Cain smirked as she looked over. &quot;I showed you mine, it&#39;s only fair you show me yours.&quot; As he pulled the second coin purse out, Cain let out a low whistle. &quot;I didn&#39;t know finding stray coins on the ground paid so well.&quot; At the sound of Yarrow undoing his wrapped clothing, she began to divest herself of her gear as well. The mingled sounds of their undressing seemed to charge the air around Cain, and she shivered, delighted by the anticipation.

Although she kept her face calm, Cain&#39;s eyes seemed to light up at Yarrow&#39;s last question. &quot;If you&#39;re offering to wash my hair, I wouldn&#39;t say no.&quot; While her tone was even as she folded her clothes, her eyes again danced at the idea.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

You&#39;ve collected a good haul.&quot; Yarrow nodded approvingly. He inhaled the collection of scents and warmth in the air, already starting to feel quite refreshed.

He waggled his brows at Cain as she watched him begin undressing, making a show out of his pocket&#39;s contents until.. ah yes. The coinpurse. The extra coinpurse. The extra coinpurse with his ill-gotten <s>skimmed</s> coinage from their recent adventures. <em>That</em> coinpurse. He let out an almost-sheeph chuckle (if he was even capable of being sheepish) at its existence being pointed out. &quot;I&#39;m very good at saving and scrounging,&quot; he lied. Playfully, of course. He wouldn&#39;t have believed it if someone else had said it either.

Despite the warmth of the room, stripping himself down put a slight chilly tingle to his skin that he imagined would only last until they made it in the water. -Or before, depending on how the night went. The rest of his closed were tossed to approximately join the scarves from before, though his necklaces and rings got a more delicate treatment, laid out on the seat beside him with care.

He smiled at her acceptance to the idea, a hand reaching out to gently grab her shoulder, fingers sliding down her arm as he moved towards the water enticingly. He took a test dip of a foot in the water, letting out a pleased sound before stepping down in - affording her a nice view of his backside, as well as some of his other assets. The trail of thorns that climbed his forarms also climbed from his toes, curving along his calves. Another trail moved down his spine, though the gentle light also caught faint flogging scars marring his back as well.

Shamelessly, he turned to face her, giving a cheeky grin. &quot;Excellent choice, the water is <em>very</em> nice.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She allowed herself to be drawn, laughing as she struggled out of the last of her clothes while Yarrow tugged on her arm.

She let her eyes slip down the entire length of his form appreciatively, pleased to note the additional thorns in his back and legs. She ran her other hand over his back, dancing her fingers over his spine as he slipped into the water. 

She kneeled, bending at the waist to run her fingers through the water. &quot;Oh, that is lovely.&quot;

She sat on the edge and began entering the water as well. Her physique was clearly that of someone who&#39;d seen a lot of combat, strong and toned. She also had multiple marks and scars on her body, but two were distinctive even in the low moonlight. First, a wide silvered scar started in her right armpit and wrapped around below her deltoid, almost if someone had attempted to cut off her sword arm. The second was a series of parallel silvered scars that scraped raggedly across the left half of her ribcage. She noticed Yarrow&#39;s marks, but knew she had her own. 

There was no self consciousness to her movements as she took the spot in the water next to Yarrow. She lazily sank until just her neck and head were above the water, groaning as the heat eased into her after several days traveling. She leaned her head back against the edge of the bath, her hair still pinned up.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His eyes similarly raked across her form, taking in both the beauty and the blemishes with equal parts admiration and curiosity. Imagination currently played with the sources for each, and he knew he&#39;d have to ask her about them at some point. If not tonight, later.

He slid down into the water, dipping below the surface for a few moments before rising again, hands brushing back his hair and brambles out of his face with a satisfied inhale. The warmth of the water similarly soothed his own muscles, and he scooted back to lean against the edge while a pair of hands reached up to undo his braid and shake it out behind him in a wild mess of waves and stray thorns that were decidedly sharper than the ones on his body.

He sunk in a little so he was about her height in the water, the arm on her side sliding around her waist once more, the backs of his fingers trailing along the skin until they settled on her hip. He leaned in again, head tilting forward so his lips could linger close to her ear once more. &quot;You&#39;re just as beautiful as I imagined, and twice as interesting as I anticipated. I figured you&#39;ve lived an interesting life, but <em>this,-&quot;</em> his fingers slid up until they met part of one of her scars, a thumb briefly brushing them &quot;-is something else.&quot;

It was partially a press for information, but he was equally willing to let it remain a mystery as a compliment to her badassery and general survivability.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Cain took a deep, steadying breath as he dunked underwater and began undoing his own hair. Her eyes traced the wilder brambles in his hair, her fingers itching to touch.

As if hearing her thoughts, Yarrow leaned his head closer, whispering into her ear. The water swirling around them was heavenly, as was Yarrow&#39;s touch. His hand seemed to drag sparks across her skin, and she laughed a little giddily, almost surprised at the strength of her own reactions. At his compliments, a blush dusted her neck and collarbones, partially disguised by the water.

She laughed, squirming a little bit but not moving further from his side. &quot;I might be a little bit ticklish,&quot; she admitted as his hand trailed from her hip to the rough scars over her ribs. She leaned her head on his, contemplating how to answer his question.

She let the silence hang a bit longer, listening to the building settling in the night air around them and absent-mindedly petting the patterns on his hand as she liked to do. After a moment of this, she raised her eyes to his. Finding something in their depths that solidified her choice, she decided the moment called for truth and took a small drink of her flask for courage.

&quot;Some of my very earliest memories are sparring. The group that took me in as a young girl… they believed that instinct and muscle memory could be trained much much earlier. I might have been 10? I&#39;d broken the weapons of both of my opponents, but one of them held back some kind of savagery spell in reserve. I was coming over to check his pulse; when I leaned over, he got me with sharpened fingernails.&quot;

Now that Cain had pointed it out, the parallel scratches could easily have been finger width apart.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He rather liked the look of that, he&#39;d have to shower her in even more compliments and see just how red he could get her. At the mention (and accompanying wriggling) of being ticklish, his hand obediently lowered down her side again to where it was, in one way, safer. He enjoyed the gentle petting on his hand, his thumb similarly gliding idle circles along her hip.

At her prolonged silence, he settled in and let it be, content to leave her with at least one secret and similarly enjoy the quiet of the bathhouse. His eyes closed for a moment, a contented sigh betraying a sliver of exhaustion escaping him from the comfort of their respite. Her shifting earned an eye, then both as she looked to him and snagged her flask.

He listened intently to the story, eyes glancing to the water where the scratches hid, giving a slow nod in understanding. His thumb had stilled for a moment before tracing patterns anew. &quot;You and I have had... Very different childhoods, it seems. I learned to fence, but that was for staying fit and leisure, not out of necessity. I dare say the scars give you an added.. <em>rugged</em> attractiveness. A bit of a wild side, underneath that calm of yours.&quot;

His eyes glinted hungrily for a moment, hand raising this time up to the bun still wound tight on her head. He gave it a little squeeze in a cupped hand, brows raising. &quot;Speaking of, shall I?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She was secretly quite pleased with his reaction. Cain had certainly told that story and received horrified stares in return. She met his eyes, glad for both his understanding and how he&#39;d shifted the topic to his own childhood.

&quot;Fencing, hm? I can see you now, quite a little terror with the blade.&quot; Her voice was warm, though, teasing. &quot;I bet the skills still come in handy now.&quot;

As he gestured to her hair, there was no hesitation before she nodded yes. Normally, having met someone less than a week ago, she would never put herself in such a vulnerable position with them. But she knew several secrets of Yarrow&#39;s, and he knew a few of hers now. Plus, the kind of person who stopped when someone admitted they were ticklish instead of pressing the advantage met firm approval in Cain&#39;s book.

Her long, straight hair as it was currently was deeply and intricately wound in some kind of bun around two chopsticks, which secured the style. A few braids ranged from the front of her head into the back of the bun, seemingly securing shorter face framing layers that would otherwise get in the way while she was fighting. At Yarrow&#39;s close vantage point, he would be able to see the humidity beginning to curl the ends poking their way out.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I do just fine with a blade nowadays, so I&#39;d like to think I retained <em>something</em> from my lessons.&quot; Yarrow chuckled at his own expense, memories of completely beefing it as a child flooded to mind briefly. He hadn&#39;t been any good at it until he felt like he had a <em>need</em> to learn it, then learn it with complete determination he did.

At the Ok to go, he shifted just a little closer, twisting so he could raise both arms to her hair to carefully begin undoing the bun. His chest twisted close, weight shifting to a bent knee to raise him up so his shoulders and chest were above the water. The chopsticks were pulled first, set on the edge with more care than he gave his own clothes before fingers teased the wound hair free from it&#39;s resting place. He noted the slight curl with a glinting curiosity, fingers feathering through the length of hair to help it breathe. The little braids were undone as well with all the practice he got from his own.

He hummed thoughtfully, hands cradling the back of her skull as he peered down from above. &quot;I dare say you keep <em>much</em> better care of this than I do mine. I&#39;m a little jealous.&quot;

He leaned down to press a kiss to her temple before his hands reached down to grab at her. Though he gave a naughty chuckle, his aims for the moment only seemed to be twisting the pair until they sat sideways with him behind, all the better for him to gently lower her in the water (against him, naturally), wetting her hair so he could begin massaging hair oil into her scalp.

&quot;Is that a little curl I see? Do you straighten it, or am I just lucky?&quot; He mused in tease.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I cannot remember the last time someone did this for me,&quot; she admitted, the intimacy of the moment pulling the honest statement out. Her eyes had involuntarily closed as Yarrow worked, and Cain felt pliable and limber in the hot water as Yarrow adjusted them. He met no resistance and she relaxed further into his hold, but she opened her eyes, looking up at him. 

The easy affection of the kiss at her temple left her breathless enough that her tone was noticeably affected as she spoke in reply. &quot;To tell you the truth, I just kind of let it be. It&#39;s always up and out of my way in protective hairstyles, and I forget how long it is.&quot; Completely undone, her hair tumbled down to a little higher than the middle of her back. &quot;It grows fast, and I often end up just hacking it off at some campsite with a knife. The ends have always done that, but it&#39;s pretty straight naturally. And I should hope you plan on being lucky tonight.&quot; Her voice was back under control by the end of her statement, impish and playful. 

She reached a hand up and ran a thumb over his cheekbone before taking one of his loose brambles gently into her grasp, inspecting it.

&quot;I think you certainly win on uniqueness though. What makes you grow thorns for hair?&quot; Her eyes fluttered back closed as Yarrow&#39;s fingers found a particularly tender spot at the base of her skull, and she sighed in pleasure.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He thought for a moment, brow furrowing slightly before he offered her a noncommittal smile in agreement. &quot;Neither can I,&quot; He murmured, hands beginning again with just the slightest more delicacy. It was a quiet marvel for him to run fingers through hair without needing to worry about catching brambles. He didn&#39;t miss the change in her voice, though perhaps for her benefit, he remained quiet as she spoke and worked herself back to that flirty normalcy.

“I do like it long on you, though I understand why you’d trim or tie it up. Same reason I braid mine back, if I’m to boldy guess. And as for luck, I’d say this entire little trip with you has been a raving lucky success so far. I weep for everyone else with far less interesting things to do than be here with you.”

The touch to his cheek was soft and his eyes closed in immediate acceptance, skin practically alight under such a gentle act. He could melt right there under a touch like that. His eyes opened as she gently grasped the bramble, and he leaned in a little closer to give her room to examine to her heart’s content. For all intents and purposes, it felt like a regular vine, slightly woody in a way that a plant lacking consistent watering might, but still very much alive and flexible enough to coil around as she pleased. Or as he pleased; his expression was a bit placid from the gentle touch. Unlike hair, the vine had a soft sense of touch along the length of it, earning a little shiver.

“Careful how hard you tug that,” he purred in both invitation and warning. It’d take a moderately careful hand to firmly grasp it without drawing blood, though the thorns were spaced enough that it wasn’t difficult to do so.

“The thorns are… part of my inheritance. They came with the nightmares, lucky me.” He said dryly, though the shrug he gave suggested he’d long accepted the presence of both as a matter of fact in his life. “They’re not all bad, though. I’ve learned how to use them, like <em>so.”</em> A hand pulled free from her hair, reaching out towards the collection of bottles. Though they were close enough to reach if he’d straightened up from his bowed position, he flicked a hand towards the bottles in a grasping gesture. In the low light, the gentle grooves of vines in his skin seemed to <em>shift,</em> and a vine whipped out from his forearm to wrap around a bottle before yanking it back into his awaiting grasp.

“I can do more with them, but I look far less handsome when I do.” He chuckled, settling the bottle back down on the bath’s edge.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

If she was going to respond to gentleness with honesty, she reasoned internally, she didn’t think she was alone. 

&quot;I wasn&#39;t allowed to keep it long when I was younger, so I think I started growing it out as some kind of rebellion. Other than being annoying, its length hasn’t really impacted me, which makes the childhood rules even more frustrating. I&#39;m glad you like it, though.&quot; Cain’s tone tended to flatten out whenever she spoke of her childhood, but warmth infused her voice for the last statement.

Cain met his eyes as Yarrow spoke of his inheritance, listening intently and studying his response to how she gently coiled and unwound a particularly long vine. She wanted to ask about the nightmares, but was momentarily distracted. She didn’t hide her delight at his use of the vines to acquire the bottle. “I knew you were clever, even before I found out you were a polyglot physician. That is attractive in and of itself.”

She hadn&#39;t really considered herself a botanist or plant person before this, but something uniquely attracted her to the vines and brambles of her companion. Perhaps it was just Yarrow, speaking strongly to the part of her that liked to dance with danger. To say she found the thorns alluring would be an understatement, and she was glad he’d unbraided his own hair for her to fiddle with. She studied the aasimar’s response to her, noting with delight that the vines in his hair seemed just as sensitive as the thorns she brushed against on his arms and back. She let out a little smirk as she had an idea.

“I think if I wanted something a little harder, I’d just-” her voice trailed off as she reached her other hand up to loosely loop through a section of normal hair until she had it firmly in hand, and gave that a proper tug, not intending to harm but rather tantalize after Yarrow’s purring invitation.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was a reasonable response to controlling environments, and it simply added to his enjoyment of her. Her control was like a fine veneer over a wild beast beneath, and that was something he could appreciate.

He gave her a cheeky grin at the compliment of his intelligence. He often didn&#39;t feel it in recent years, but to have some remnants from the skills he&#39;d built through sweat and tears all those years ago still shine through enough for another to see despite all his rust.. whether it was simply a compliment to stroke his ego or truth, he accepted it all the same.

His eyes dipped briefly to her head as he continued massaging shampoo into her hair; it&#39;d likely been shampooed well enough to be rinsed if he hadn&#39;t found himself enjoying the task so much to just keep going. He looked back as she spoke up again, just in time to feel her grab his hair and give it a tug. He hissed a pleased whimper, biting his lip a moment at the welcome roughness. After a breath, he stretched his face to hover close to hers, brushing noses briefly. &quot;Je speelt een gevaarlijk spel, <em>my lady.&quot;</em> He hissed in abyssal.

A hand pulled free of her hair, dipping briefly into the water to wash off the suds before sliding down the hollow between neck and jaw, then down to her collarbone in predatory drag. His free hand wound itself in her hair slowly, holding her head exactly where he pleased.

Cain’s eyes glinted with undisguised pleasure, and she felt poised in the shared moment. She didn’t know what Yarrow had hissed at her, but his words rolled through the air like a promise, their tones intentional and consuming. As they breathed shared air, her eyes flitted across his face, lighting on his lips momentarily before returning to meet his gaze hungrily. 

His hand was like fire down her neck, branding her with touch, and as he slid over her collarbone, she wondered if he could feel the intensity of her heartbeat. Her training had taught her to regulate such things. She should control it, slow her pulse, take back ownership of this situation… but she gave herself over to feeling instead. She drew a shaky breath, not bothering at all to hide how affected she was.

The hand she had wound in his hair tightened briefly, walking the tightrope between pleasure and pain, before she released that lock of hair entirely. She moved to stroke down the bramble that often hung in front of Yarrow’s eyes, fingers light and delicate as they danced down the vine and thorns, a contrast to her previous pull.

She went to move, the motion curtailed by the hand slowly winding its way through her now clean and still sudsy hair. And then it was Cain hissing a pleased inhale, as she tested the strength of his grip without any real intention to break free.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was over all too quickly for his tastes, though the replacement of tender touches along his wayward vine earned Cain a needy whine. Though the pulse of his heartbeat wasn&#39;t under her hands, it was safe to say his was similarly, unabashedly, wholeheartedly drawn in by her touch.

Her test on his grip was met with firm resistance, the muscles of his arms tensing just enough to combat her testing tug, long enough to keep her there in tease for a few long moments. Eventually he released her, hand moving to unwind itself from the length of her hair in the water to release some of the suds. The hand on her collarbone dipped, fingers skating down her sternum before raking back featherlight nails.

He turned his head until his lips found her hand still toying with the vine, eyes focused intently on hers. Eventually his eyes roamed again, taking in every inch he could before he let out a breathy chuckle. &quot;I know we came here to bathe, but I would much rather see if the rest of you tastes just as sweet as what I&#39;ve kissed so far.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She pulled back a little, resting her hand on his knee in the process, seeming loath to not be in some form of tangible contact. She took a quick breath and dunked underwater entirely, shaking the remaining suds out of her hair. 

She rose from the water, standing to her full height, probably giving quite a show in the process. She moved a hand to Yarrow&#39;s shoulder, taking her other hand to tip his chin up. She leaned in, speaking softly into his ear. 

&quot;You&#39;ll find me enthusiastically consenting, but not here. I like to take my time, and if this goes the way I plan, we would definitely overstay our reservation-&quot; and here she nipped the shell of his ear. &quot;Besides, I was promised loud, and I have a feeling that might bring more of an audience than I&#39;m keen for if we stay here.&quot;

He had asked a question in a way, hadn&#39;t he? Somewhere deep inside, he cursed his wine-addled tongue for even mentioning it; he could have been happy wiling away the evening together in the bath as they were.

She arrested his attention fully as she stood, eyes once again hungrily taking in the sight of her. His eyes broke their pilgrimage first at the touch to his shoulder, then flicking up to meet hers as she guided his chin up. He shivered under the commanding touch, stiffening at perfect attention lest he melt away, lest he disappoint. Each little touch burned under his skin, her breath and words quieting his mind in an instant.

With the way she spoke, each word solidified the desire burning through his every fiber, the nip to his ear eliciting a hitched breath and moan. <em>Gods,</em> she could make him walk to the edge of the world and back, so enamored with her decision. <em>The way I plan,</em> and his mind kickstarted once more into eager overdrive.

Ill content to keep his hands to himself even despite her declaration, one hand accepted hers while the other settled on her thigh, sliding up to her waist as he stood. He returned the grin, leaning in to brush his lips against her ear as well to whisper a most agreeable &quot;Your rooms.&quot; Another brief kiss, and he spun to reacquaint himself with their towels and clothes.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As they returned to their things, she nodded at Yarrow&#39;s carefully laid out collection of jewelry. &quot;You&#39;ll have to tell me about the others sometime, if you&#39;d like.&quot; Cain was curious, but she left the press for information casual, as Yarrow had done earlier, wondering if it was too late in the evening for secrets.

Rather than putting all her layers back on, Cain selected her loosest top and leggings for her bottoms, dressing quickly in a pared down version of her normal garb. She usually looked well put together, her layered clothing intentional and effective for her line of work. Her simpler current outfit also suited her, softened the intensity of her usual presentation. Plus, she was too lazy to put all her things on simply for the short journey back to her guild rooms, where it was likely to be removed in short order anyway. She looked over to check on Yarrow&#39;s progress.

Her things all collected, she walked over next to him, her hair still long and unbound as she used a towel to wring out some of the water.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He flashed Cain a small grin at her casual question as he began the task of requiring his jewelry. &quot;I&#39;m afraid most of it has the same story. All of it definitely.. acquired through nefarious means. We were allowed to loot certain things from the ships we raided for ourselves, while the rest went to Her. We did once manage to find an honest to gods hidden treasure chest, though!&quot; He tugged out a particular necklace with sapphires from the collective, giving her a proud grin for it before he let it drop and rejoin the rest.

He left his boots for last, tugging them on after giving his feet a quick rub of his towel. The spare belts and scarves bundled under an arm while he considered the towel; it probably would be best for them to drop them off with the dirty laundry, wouldn&#39;t it? At any rate, it&#39;d be the smallest kindness that might make breaking back in again all the easier.

His thoughts scattered as he admired her anew, giving a low whistle of appreciation. &quot;Well, now don&#39;t you look ravishing? When we get back to your rooms, let me undress you.&quot; He slung the towel over his shoulder, reaching over to hook a finger in the hem of her leggings which wiggled almost in lamentation they even had to clothe up for the trip. His eyes still held that passionate spark, the embers burning in wait.

Once they&#39;d collected their things (he noted the shampoo being added to that definition with firm approval) he guided them quietly to the door. A peek out told they were still alone, and he once again flicked his palm up  to light a flame for Cain to guide them back out once more.

It was like a decidedly sexier Ghalasine, he mused.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She could see why he’d been led to acquire them, the goal and ownership probably providing a sense of control over something when much about his situation with the pirates had been driven by others’ whims. It was also telling that he held on to them, when the sapphire piece especially was probably worth many drinks.

She grinned at the compliment, quipping “I’d be disappointed if you didn’t,” before she slipped her hands inside his wrapped garb. She splayed her fingers over the planes of his chest before she sent searching fingers into the folds serving as pockets, fishing out her lockpick set from where she’d seen him place it. “These, I would be quite remiss had they been stolen by our erstwhile fey friend. A few of them I bought, but some I custom made to suit my style of picking locks.” 

Noticing Yarrow taking care of the towels, Cain scanned the room and made a quick circuit to pick up the extra evidence of their visit as well as her abandoned hair chopsticks. She swore ruefully, glad she’d noticed them. She moved to put her hair up, remembered Yarrow’s comments about liking it, and casually slipped the chopsticks in a pocket instead.

After they slipped through the dark corridors and out the window, Cain turned back to lock it. As she&#39;d mentioned earlier, she was not as fast as Yarrow or Jaska. By the time she&#39;d relocked the window, the cool night air combined with her wet hair had chilled her slightly. She pressed up against Yarrow to leech away his warmth, too lazy to add a layer of clothing.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was almost exposing in a way, giving him an odd sense of vulnerability that he might dare say he enjoyed. He gave her a cheeky chuckle as she took back her lockpicks, the grin he flashed saying he would have surely given them back. Eventually. &quot;It&#39;s a very nice set, I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m just a little jealous. But, I&#39;m even gladder you still had them, they&#39;ve earned their keep tonight.&quot;

Though the aasimar was typically one to tease at a moment&#39;s notice, he kept careful watch as Cain locked back up, a hand lingering on her shoulder. It wouldn&#39;t do for their grand escape to be bumbled because he couldn&#39;t keep his mouth shut, after all. Not that, if he was in the business of admitting, he was too terribly skilled with lockpicks either.

He sucked in a greedy breath of the nighttime air, enjoying the slight chill in the air. As Cain huddled closer, he wrapped one of his extra scarves around her before following it up with an arm to pull her tight, eyes briefly noting her long hair with immense pleasure. Though he licked his lips in anticipation, he maintained his silence until they&#39;d obtained sufficient distance from the bathhouse to speak up. Or whisper, rather, lips ghosting over her ear once again. &quot;Fantastic work, Cain. I daresay no one will suspect a thing. We might even be able to waltz in tomorrow morning with none the wiser.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I much prefer the discount of a clandestine rendezvous.&quot;  Cain&#39;s statement was matter of fact, almost as if she were remarking on the weather, but her smile was extremely self satisfied. She paused for a few paces as they walked before continuing. “I can’t believe I’m offering, but I’d make a set with you. They last longer than the commercial kits, and you can customize them for your hand.” She grimaced a bit. “It’s better I’m on a team with a real thief. I use too much force and break standard kits.” She laughed a bit, seeming self conscious, and rubbed the back of her neck with a hand. 

As they wound through the streets, Cain took what she hoped was a direct approach back to her rooms, trusting if they veered too off course, her companion would redirect them. “Do you room with the guild? I admit, the comped board is one of the better deals I’ve come across. My… diverse skill set is valued, and I have a guaranteed place to sleep at night that’s warm and dry.” The fact that she even needed to clarify spoke to a multitude of previous experiences. “One might be convinced to stay here, given good enough motivation.” Whether Cain meant the night ahead or the free rooms was up to Yarrow’s interpretation.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He would be hard pressed to argue in favor of the bathhouse during the day, not after their too-short stay this evening. Though tonight he&#39;d promised her a noisy evening, he entertained thoughts of revisiting the location at a later date to more fully enjoy the amenities and test how <em>quiet</em> they could be. The thought gave him a little shiver of anticipation, and it took him a moment to realize what she&#39;d said after speaking up once again.

He blinked, a genuine smile slipping free at the idea and the gesture. He reigned it back in under that sensual mask he&#39;d been delighting in all evening, but a hint of his being touched by the offer still peeked out. &quot;You&#39;d do that for lil old me? Well, don&#39;t let me say no to that, thank you. But -&quot; and his free hand reached over to slide fingertips under the hem of her shirt to delight in her abs &quot;-I think you do <em>juuust</em> fine with the skills and strengths you have. And really, having the kit in the first place makes you just as much a thief as me as far as I&#39;m concerned.&quot; He finished with a more conspiratory whisper that was as much a compliment as it was an attempt to reassure that hint of self consciousness.

Yarrow let Cain lead for the most part, though a grip around her waist here and there occasionally guided them down a different street or alley according to his mental map instead. Thankfully for the pair, the guild wasn&#39;t too far from the bathhouse and the hall&#39;s grand stature soon loomed close enough to be easily spotted.

Yarrow let out a thoughtful hum, finding her experiences with valuing a reliable place to sleep quite relatable, even if he found himself more of a vagrant on purpose. &quot;Free board&#39;s a very nice deal, yeah. It&#39;s one of the reasons I decided to join up, though practice I try spending as little time there as possible. I&#39;d much rather be someone&#39;s bedwarmer in their room if I can help it. Sleeping alone does terrible things to the morale.&quot; He chuckled. It was true that he was shameless in his vices, though having someone in his arms (or in theirs) did wonders to assuage his nightmares. There was little surprise he&#39;d turn to such comforts in the face of such horror.

His eyes glinted in renewed hunger, a hand gently curling through a lock of her hair with reverent admiration. &quot;If your bed has the room for it, I&#39;ll stay as long as you let me, as many nights as I can. Of course, if you&#39;d simply rather trial the Yarrow Experience ™️, I understand completely.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There was something about Yarrow&#39;s easy acceptance and varied life experiences that kept her guard down. &quot;We can go by the blacksmith and pick out some choice scraps. If I can charm them into giving us access to the forge for a few days, it will make shaping the tools easier. It&#39;s a date.&quot; She ended her statement on a roguish wink.

She wound an arm around his waist in return, appreciating the trail of his fingers on her skin. The frisson that slipped through her spine had nothing to do with the cool evening, and everything to do with anticipation. She laughed as he described himself as an experience, a warm and affectionate sound. &quot;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any fear we won&#39;t have a good time tonight. Our experiments earlier have uncovered some delightful compatibility. And you cook, right? I can do about two meals decently, so if you&#39;re down to make a frittata or something in the morning, I may never let you leave.&quot; She teased and bumped his shoulder companionably in what he would probably recognize as a uniquely Cain maneuver at this point. &quot;Not that I&#39;d want to keep you from your other exploits, but my rooms are always open. I also don&#39;t like to sleep alone.&quot; She didn&#39;t elaborate, but she was being rather candid in her last statement.

As the guild hall appeared, Cain increased her pace ever so slightly, the arm around Yarrow still firmly keeping them linked. As they slipped in, the evening front attendant barely looked up from reading after recognizing Cain and Yarrow, and Cain led the way to the suite she was currently calling home. She paused outside her door, fishing an actual key from the clothes in her hand and ushered them both inside.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1128732603688685618 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1128732603688685618><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, July 12, 2023 10:00 AM">10:00 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She dumped most of her things in a pile on a table just inside the door to sort through later.

He returned the wink, grinning from ear to ear. Not even a full night together and already they were planning another date. It felt oddly anchoring to the man who made sure to cast as wide a net as possible, but he found it pleasantly so in Cain&#39;s spontaneous nature.

The invitation to stay and cook earned a laugh. He returned her shoulder bump, both in thanks for the offer, and the openness of the invitation. Nothing set in stone other than the promise of a good time. &quot;I will make you the <em>best</em> fucking frittata you&#39;ve ever had. All other frittatas will pale in comparison. You&#39;ll be a changed woman.&quot; He promised. The threat of staying didn&#39;t sound like much of a threat tonight between the alcohol, the touch of her skin, and the sound of her voice.

He barely paid attention to the rest of the guild hall as they entered in; his late night arrivals were a frequent occasion, often far in the evening after all other avenues of enjoyment were spent. He followed Cain to her rooms, taking note of the door number for future reference while she fiddled with the lock.

He moseyed in with immediate eagerness, taking in.. well, it looked pretty much the same as his, professional and mostly disused. He held some pleasure in imagining how it&#39;d look the longer she stayed. Eyes pulled from the room as she spoke up, his interest -and cravings- suitably piqued anew. &quot;No water. What sort of wine do you have?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Altaira mentioned that she could send someone to supply my kitchen, since I had barely arrived in town before we left for Ghalasine. That woman is terrifyingly efficient. I did explicitly ask for wine, though.” 

Glad to be out of the elements, Cain slipped out the scarf Yarrow had lent her, as well as her socks and shoes. She passed the scarf back to him and brushed her fingertips over his hand in the process. With a coy smile she nodded in the direction of the kitchen, indicating he should follow her.

Once there, Cain began opening and closing cabinets seemingly at random. “It does seem like someone&#39;s been by to supply… Honestly your guess is as good as mine as to where- Ah. Looks like a bottle of Chianti, and a Riesling - that might be too sweet for my taste - and a Pinot Noir. Nothing quite as nice as what we had earlier, I&#39;m afraid. Any preference?”

Cain began picking through the rest of her pantry, hunting for some sort of glasses and a wine opener and getting a general sense of what she now owned. &quot;And actual food! That&#39;s promising for our frittata endeavors. If I could just find the blasted wine opener...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Besides, that simply meant the two could figure out the answer together. He hummed in agreement regarding the guildmaster&#39;s efficiency, and noting Cain&#39;s removal of her socks and shoes, did the same. The returned scarf and the brush of fingers earned a grateful flash of a grin though he was quick to deposit both (and the collective of items he stored in his wraps) on the table near her pile of Stuff ™️ so he could close the gap between them once again.

He helped paw through the cabinets for wine, taking an occasional moment to take stock of what supplies she had to make good on his promise of morning frittatas. He paused his (helpful!) snooping to admire the bottles she found, fingers skating delicately over the bottles before nodding in decision. &quot;The Noir for tonight. Can&#39;t really go wrong with a Noir.&quot;

He let out a little laugh as she resumed the search for a bottle opener, rejoining the search once again. Though he checked cabinets anew with an amused lilt to his voice, he was starting to lose interest in the search. &quot;You&#39;d think I&#39;d have one on me, wouldn&#39;t you? Worst case scenario, we can always use a shoe, but if it comes down to that, I think I&#39;d rather have <em>you.&quot;</em>

A different hunger taking over once again, Yarrow slid back to Cain&#39;s side, an arm wrapping around her waist from behind to slide under her shirt. His fingers moved across her abs, drinking in every dip as deeply as he did wine, while his other hand moved up to comb through her hair, exposing enough of her neck for a kiss. Then another. And another.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She rested her head back against Yarrow as he explored her neck, the heat that had been between them all evening coming back in full force now that they were alone again.

&quot;That&#39;s actually what I meant when I said a taste of something else,&quot; she admitted as her eyes fluttered closed. &quot;Regarding the Yarrow Experience™, I&#39;m intrigued. Consider me an your pupil… and an active learner,&quot; she remarked slyly.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

How dare he get distracted with the promise of wine when he had this tall drink all to himself? &quot;I&#39;m glad to see my transgression has not soured your hopes for the evening. Allow me to make it up to you... and do note that you now have my full, <em>undivided</em> attention for the rest of the evening, <em>ma dame.&quot;</em>

Another kiss, and then his hands flew to relieve her of her shirt, tossing it aside in haphazard abandon. &quot;Beautiful,&quot; he purred, nuzzling her back with a sharp inhale. They&#39;d barely gotten a chance to truly enjoy the baths, though the traces of dampness brought the memory back briefly. A far more romantic location than the kitchen, he noted. He&#39;d have to correct that, and soon. For now, he circled around her to see her in the light, one arm curling around her back while the other tangled with her hair to cup her head.

He drew close, clearing his throat before lowering his voice to a husky whisper, lips brushing against hers. It was an attempt at professionalism, though the hunger in his eyes focused completely on hers with predatory focus in a way that was barely restrained. It took everything he had to speak instead of simply diving in. &quot;Well then, my gorgeous pupil.. The Yarrow Experience ™️ is a hands on activity. Whatever you want, take it from me, I&#39;m yours to use. Just know that I <em>do</em> bite, and I will be having dessert first.&quot;

With that, he pulled her in for a kiss, arms tightening their grip in fanatical possession. The warmth in his groin pressed tellingly against her from the close contact, the hand on her back moving down her spine until it found her ass and squeezed.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Watching Yarrow admire from all angles, Cain winked confidently, although the rosy flush on her collarbones grew with each additional compliment. The piece of hair she&#39;d been idly spinning in her fingers while he&#39;d walked around her was dislodged when he stepped back in; as Yarrow wound his fingers through her hair, Cain moaned softly, appreciating the tension.

She almost stopped breathing when his lips finally brushed hers, a fleeting, tantalizing touch. She met his eyes with a look of need, matching the intensity in his gaze. 

And, finally, he kissed her. She felt like every sense was heightened, keying her to this moment. She almost swore she felt electricity. She wound a hand through the hair at the nape of his neck, testing Yarrow&#39;s reaction to a gentle pull while her other hand gripped his hip to draw their bodies together.

When they finally paused to take a breath, it was Cain&#39;s turn to look predatory. Her instincts had been right. This was going to be <em>very</em> fun. A hint of a smirk slipped into her smile as she thought of Yarrow&#39;s threat. &quot;Oh, but I would be disappointed if you didn&#39;t bite.&quot; Her voice was sultry, thick with intention. She plucked at his scarves and wraps. &quot;Take these off. I quite liked the view in the bath, and I&#39;d like another look.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He licked his lips, the comfortable restrictions of his clothes suddenly far too tight, and far too much in the way. &quot;As you wish.~&quot;

He pulled free with grace, tugging the scarf free first until his shirt hung loose. After that it was a simple matter of rolling his shoulders free of the shirt until it dropped, pants following in practiced, showy movements. Bare, he raised his arms a moment in display, proudly showing off all of his assets.

Roaming eyes held him at attention even as he slid back in to drop to a knee. Fingers curled in the hem of her pants and he leaned forward to kiss her, starting from her navel before moving down, down... But as his hands tugged her leggings down and away, his kisses teasingly moved to her hip, down again to nuzzle against her inner thigh. He nipped with a moan before sucking the skin, greedily leaving his mark and chased it with more kisses that never quite moved in. Mischievous eyes stared up at hers, his hands gripping her hips to keep her in place.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She gave a low, appreciative whistle as he finished, and trailed her fingertips across his body. Starting at his shoulders, she danced her fingers over his chest, appreciating the view of his physique and distinct textures and patterns fully on display. As she brushed one of his nipples, she bent her head slightly to nip the other one delicately, appreciatively of Yarrow’s similar height to her.

As Yarrow slipped down out of reach of her mouth, she met his gaze, intending to voice her complaint as he moved away after such a tantalizing taste. She caught the words in her mouth as his direction made his intentions known, and she drew a shaky breath as his lips trailed lower.

Requiring little convincing to finish the work of stepping out of her leggings, Cain was eager to remove that last barrier. With a pleased sound, she gave herself to the sensations of his ministrations. Still gently, she carded her fingernails through his hair; her thumb grazed a thorn, causing her to hiss as that seemed to heighten her pleasure. “You’re a delightful tease,” she almost groaned in that same voice full of longing, meeting his playful eyes.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Had he a mind to truly think on it, he too enjoyed their similar heights making this even easier than it was.

He smirked as the words caught in her throat, helping her remove the last of her leggings. From his kneeling viewpoint, he could do little but stare up in adoration and longing and hunger. Her hands teased his scalp with how gentle they were, his eyes fluttering momentarily as the hand on her rump dug in to thread that needle between pleasure and pain. He knew she could take it, and he knew she could dish it back.

He looked back up as she spoke, eyes crinkling in a smile. He nuzzled the crook between leg and groin before dragging his tongue up in agonizing slowness. He hummed in satisfaction, well aware of his hot breath and the slight rumble from his throat, even as his tongue <em>still</em> never quite delved too close.

He waggled his tongue against her skin in feather-light touches before pulling away, just enough to rest his chin against the dip of her hip and stare up with lusty eyes. &quot;Tell me what you want.&quot; he crooned.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Always one for action in addition to words, Cain slid her index and middle fingers under Yarrow’s chin, her touch feather-light but wanting to lift him up for another kiss. She moved closer, pressing the length of her body against him, marveling at how they fit together. She paused just shy of grazing his lips with hers. Her voice now an intense whisper, she let her eyes flit to his mouth. “Shall we find a horizontal surface and see if your tongue is as talented as I’m imagining?” And then she closed the distance between them, groaning into his mouth at how good it felt to taste and touch and kiss.

She was almost drunk on the feeling, grateful for Yarrow’s arms wrapped around her, stabilizing her. She whimpered into his mouth, splayed her fingers against his chest, and pushed them into the direction of the door to the rest of her rooms.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His lips trembled under the brush of hers, a whine lingering in want in the back of his throat. The press of their bodies burned, and he moaned as hands slid up her back anew to keep her there.

Like the drunk fool he was, he sunk into that kiss with an approving hunger, blood singing anew with desperation to sweep her away right then and there. <em>&quot;yes,&quot;</em> he gasped as their lips broke, pressing another kiss to hers again between breaths. Though he held her stable, he too wobbled as his head swarmed. At her push he moved, stumbling along towards the bedroom with an eager speed, and a stubborn determination to not lose a single inch of contact between them.

The sight of her bed was like a homecoming, and with a laugh he flung them to its comforting embrace. Quick to clamber on top, his hand fisted in her hair as he stole another kiss, tongue flashing against her lips with a moan. He nipped her lip, lips moving down her jaw and neck as he begun his descent anew, hands following to grope in their wake. &quot;You&#39;re delicious, Cain.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">The next morning…</code>

When Cain slowly came to alertness the following morning there was a solid line of warmth against her back, and the arm wrapped around her waist had a very distinctive trail of thorns on the forearm. She gave a small stretch, luxuriating in the comfort of sleeping with Yarrow behind her. She blinked lazily a few times, watching motes of dust drift gently through the morning sunlight, content to luxuriate in the moment for a little longer. Yarrow breathed steadily behind her, but she couldn&#39;t tell if he was asleep or not.

Her mind flashed with memories of the previous night, and she stretched lazily again, giving a singularly pleased and satisfied smirk. Yarrow had indeed proven quite talented with his tongue, and together they&#39;d discovered themselves to be rather well matched in desires. To say she and Yarrow were compatible wouldn&#39;t begin to cover it. She wondered if she could convince him to stay the night again. 

From the position of the morning sun through her window, she guessed it was later, but not terribly so. She wondered if Yarrow had been able to sleep, or if he&#39;d been plagued by the nightmares he mentioned every now and again.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He did indeed still sleep, blissfully still and quiet. Cain&#39;s presence in his arms had been both pleasant and something of a lifeline that had successfully kept the nightmares away. A dreamless sleep, but much welcomed nevertheless.

He sighed gently through his nose, face re-burying itself in her hair, his own trailing unbound behind him. The arm around her curled in just a hair more, as if to say <em>5 more minutes.</em>

The light did eventually rouse him, a more intentional deep breath following a soft hum. One eye peeked open, blinking blearily before he moved his head back just enough to see properly. &quot;Morning, Cain.&quot; He murmured in sleepy fondness. &quot;Sleep well?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I can&#39;t remember the last time I slept this well... You?&quot; she replied, feeling oddly exposed and honest in the morning light. She blinked as her fingers began drawing lazy patterns on his arms. 

In the soft morning light, more of her rooms were visible. The prior evening, she had only eyes for Yarrow, but now she scanned the room briefly. A small collection of weapons rested on a dresser, as well as more of the strange vials like the few she&#39;s turned out of her pockets on the way to the bathhouse. Her large Great Scimitar leaned against the same dresser. On a comfortable looking chair in the corner, Cain had amassed a small collection of clean laundry.

She turned her attention back to her companion, pressing another kiss into the hollow of his neck.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I haven&#39;t slept this well since-&quot; Yarrow paused, brow furrowing with realization &quot;-we got robbed, actually. But other than that... It&#39;s been far too long. If staying here&#39;s the secret to a good night&#39;s sleep, you may find it hard to get rid of me.&quot; That smile returned with a little playfulness, hand starting to card through her hair in a loose measure of detangling.

While her eyes wandered the room, his lidded a little to linger in that sleepy feeling, admiring her in the late-morning light. He sighed in gentle appreciation at the kiss on his neck, head shifting back to allow her access.

His hopes rose at the idea of continuing the night&#39;s ministrations into the morning, but the sudden gurgle from his stomach reminded him of more pressing hungers (or at least in this case, literal ones.) He let out a sheepish chuckle, pressing a kiss to her cheek. &quot;I vaguely remember you expressing interest in some frittatas. Still interested?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The nest they&#39;d made in the soft blankets was cozy, quite a contrast to the recent nights spent on the road. Although Cain liked her hammock, she&#39;d take a bed with Yarrow over camping, hands down. She huffed a soft breath into his neck, smiling a pleased smile, and spoke with a mischievous tone. &quot;Who says I&#39;m willing to let you leave?&quot; She teased a love bite above his collarbone with her tongue, letting her eyes flutter back closed as she enjoyed the hand parsing gently through her sleep-mused hair for a few more quiet moments.

Cain brightened when Yarrow mentioned frittatas. &quot;Oh, yes please. I really am a horrible cook. I can chop and dice well enough-&quot; Cain&#39;s eyes drifted to her weapons as she spoke, &quot;-but I&#39;m hopeless when it comes to combining flavors. Another venue in which I am your eager student.&quot; Her tone was sly as she finished with a small nip to his collarbone.

With a final kiss, Cain regretfully slipped out of Yarrow&#39;s warm embrace, padding without an ounce of self-consciousness over to her clothes pile. She slipped a shirt over her head and stepped into a pair of underwear, and grabbed a second oversized shirt. &quot;Want something clean?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He let out a purr as she teased the blooming bite on his collarbone, admiring similar marks he&#39;d left along her body as well. They&#39;d likely be tender, and not all of them were easily hideable, not that he imagined Cain minded.

At the agreement for frittatas, he shifted to begin the sad departure from their cozy nest. The nip was a solace, as was the view of Cain&#39;s backside on her way to fetch clothes. He swung his legs to sit on the edge of the bed and stretch, looking back over as she offered clothes. &quot;Ah yeah, sure. Do you have anything that&#39;d fit? If not, I don&#39;t mind wearing what I came back in. I&#39;m still due for a proper bath anyways.&quot;

He also didn&#39;t mind cooking in the nude, but that was usually discouraged in his experience.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;This is pretty big on me, so you can try it? I am... not petite though.&quot; She laughed, and stretched up on her tiptoes to easily reach the ceiling. &quot;I admit I prefer the view from your usual wraps and scarves, though.&quot;  She playfully walked two fingers up his sternum and made no show of hiding her appreciation of his bare chest, before setting the extra shirt on the bed beside him.

Cain turned to the mirror in the corner of her room and began slipping her hair into a simple ponytail, she noticed with an amused snort that she definitely had a few love bites on her neck. She gave Yarrow a smirk, seeming pleased. “Evidence of a good time,” she quipped before turning to meander back to the kitchen.

Once there, she began rummaging through her cabinets again, hunting for coffee or tea supplies.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He wouldn&#39;t complain if she never wore pants again, to be completely honest. He nodded up at her, agreeing with her assessment. Their heights were similar, and she was definitely built with an impressive amount of muscle (which he always appreciated.) The fingers earned an agreeable hum from the aasimar and a smirk before he accepted the shirt to shrug on. It was a tighter fit than he usually wore, but perfectly serviceable. And, despite being clean, still held that slight <em>Cain-ness</em> to it that made him smile.

Yeah, he was stealing this.

&quot;Fits like a glove, thank you.&quot; He quipped approvingly. Knowing from experience that Cain&#39;s ass and hips were more impressive than his, he began to mosey back to the kitchen where his pants had been discarded, pausing briefly to slide behind her, leaning in to press a sly kiss to the blooms on her neck before snatching his pants. &quot;Shall I leave you more next time?&quot; he asked innocently.

He similarly began rummaging in the kitchen anew, mind focused on his goal for frittatas. Taking stock of her eggs, milk, and cheese, he nodded, setting them aside before scrounging for some vegetables to add in. &quot;Aha!&quot; He said, swiping a pepper, tomato, and an onion. <em>And</em> olive oil? He let out a low whistle. &quot;I dare say we might just have a fine frittata soon. Find any salt or pepper?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There was something in that deep, primal, instinctive part of her that really liked seeing him wearing her clothes. She filed that away to examine later. &quot;Only if you&#39;re trying to stake a claim and don&#39;t feel like this is sufficient,&quot; She snarked back at him with a cheerful smile, not fooled for a second by his innocent facade.

With instructions, Cain also began to peek through the cabinets. She opened a slim one, and pulled out a rolling spice rack which did indeed have salt and pepper on it. She was taking mental notes of the things Yarrow was setting out, making sure to stock them again in the future. She huffed an annoyed sigh, still short a wine opener. Noting with amusement the pile of clothes on the floor, she slipped her leggings on and said, &quot;I&#39;m just going nip down to the desk and borrow a wine opener. I had a mind for this to be a boozy brunch. Behave yourself.&quot; She raised an eyebrow at him, but her grin was affectionate.

Stepping outside, Cain squinted at the basket in her path. <em>Maybe another welcome gift from Altaira?</em> She mused as she quickly ran down to the front. Task achieved, she returned to her rooms, collecting the beautiful basket on her way in.

&quot;It smells heavenly in here, cook for me all the time.&quot; Cain&#39;s voice was warm and genuine. Her next question had a bit of confusion in tone. &quot;Did you get a... welcome basket when you joined?&quot; Something about the kiss sealing the envelope made her think this wasn&#39;t standard guild procedure as she began opening the card.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Truthfully, he&#39;d wondered if he&#39;d still remember how to make a frittata considering it&#39;d been years, but he seemed to slip back into the rhythm of it fairly easily. He returned Cain&#39;s grin, batting his eyes in return to her declaration to <em>behave</em> and the promise of more alcohol. &quot;I always do,&quot; He lied with a chirp.

When she returned, the veggies were already on their way to a nice grill while he whipped together the eggs and milk to the perfect consistency. The simmering sounds and smells brought a sort of domestic nostalgia he didn&#39;t often get to indulge in, and standing alone in the kitchen with the skillet gave him an odd feeling. Like he could forget all that had happened and he was back in med school again. The padding of her steps chased away the ghost of a fantasy, and he met her with a preening smile at the compliment.

His head canted a little at her question, gaze drifting to the basket of goodies and letter.. with a kiss? &quot;No, I didn&#39;t. What&#39;s in it?&quot; He said, only slightly put out that he hadn&#39;t gotten one too.

She had no point of reference for a morning like this from her childhood, and there has been little stock placed in leisurely calm mornings in her old guild. She was drinking this experience in, enjoying it thoroughly.

Cain pulled the card out of its envelope and opened it with a bemused grin. &quot;It&#39;s addressed both of us...&quot; and she proceeded to read it aloud as she walked over to stand next to Yarrow so he could see as well. 

&quot;Saucy minx,&quot; Cain&#39;s rueful grin was back in full force as she finished reading, thinking fondly of Niamh. &quot;I can&#39;t honestly say I&#39;m sorry for keeping folks awake, though.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He blinked, grin growing widely. &quot;There&#39;s no way,&quot; He muttered with a ghost of a laugh.

He laughed more fully as she finished, resting his chin on Cain&#39;s shoulder with a wistful sigh. An arm snaked around her waist to toy with her hem line. &quot;I kinda thought the walls would be soundproof or something, to be honest. I&#39;m just disappointed she didn&#39;t think to join us.&quot;

Then again, would they have even heard a knock? He tried to think back to that night... no, he couldn&#39;t remember a single knock amidst the throes of passion. ah well. He gave her a kiss on her shoulder and snatched a muffin, taking a bite. Though he gave no words, the mumbles and hums of approval were telling enough towards its craftsmanship. He gave the veggies a testing toss before pouring in the egg mixture with a satisfying sizzle. &quot;There&#39;s always next time then, hm?

Cain grabbed a muffin, tossing it casually into the air before catching it and relaxing back into Yarrow&#39;s hold with pleased sigh. She appreciated how tactile his affections were, growing up as she had in a group which valued stoicism of all forms. She chewed thoughtfully, letting her mind wander. If the pirate queen provided muffins and instructions to refuel, Cain was certainly not going to disobey orders. Besides, the cooking Yarrow was doing smelled delicious, and a snack until it was ready sounded perfect.

&quot;I did get a king-size bed for a reason.&quot; Cain waggled her eyebrows suggestively before continuing. &quot;Primarily the reason is height, but having room for multiple partners is certainly a selling point.&quot;

As she finished her muffin, Cain gestured to all the happenings in her kitchen. &quot;This is all rather impressive. At least let me be useful and open a bottle of wine?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He couldn&#39;t fault her logic on bed choice either, nodding in approval even as he moved back towards the stove. &quot;The room is <em>very</em> nice. Not to mention stability. Fucking around in a hammock&#39;s all fun and games until you both get dumped on the bilge.&quot;

Though Yarrow kept an ear perked towards Cain, his attention focused on the forming frittata. Still, he couldn&#39;t help but grin at the offer to uncork the wine. &quot;Yes <em>please.&quot;</em> He purred before looking wistful. &quot;Used to drink mimosas in the morning. The champagne was nice in the morning.. - Oh, open the Chianti for breakfast, leave the Pinot Noir for later.&quot;

He kept the skillet moving, angling it and using the spatula to keep uncooked egg from lingering still for too long. After about 5 minutes, he nabbed a spare plate and carefully flipped the half-done frittata onto the plate, then slid the uncooked side back down into the pan with a renewed sizzle.

&quot;Almost done! Bit of a shame to not finish it off in a stove as is proper, buuuuttt that <em>would</em> take longer.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Walking over to stand next to Yarrow at the stove, Cain placed a glass in front of him with a smile. She stayed close by, leaning against the counter and watched his casual, practiced movement with a bit of admiration. 

&quot;I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve had a mimosa in recent years. My favorite used to be pear, though.&quot; Cain&#39;s eyes were distant, focused on the memory.

As Yarrow explained the proper way to finish cooking the frittata, Cain tilted her head with a smile, and gave a little shrug. &quot;I&#39;m in no hurry.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Gods know your grip strength is up to the task.&quot;

He admired the flex of her muscle as she cracked open the bottle, purring a thanks at the fresh glass. He saved it for the time being, attention split between finishing the frittata and listening as Cain spoke. He noted that faraway look and tucked it away to ask about later, attention slipping back to his handiwork.

&quot;You may not be in a hurry, but <em>I&#39;ve</em> been craving this for a while.&quot; He said, pulling the skillet free to deposit the completed frittata on a plate. The finished product had a light yellow color,little oozes of cheese interwoven with the cooked veggies. Cutting it into little slices revealed a lovely fluffy interior, just soft enough to be quite tender. The first slice he served up for Cain, then one for himself.

Turning the heat off, he leaned against the counter so he could watch her reaction to breakfast. &quot;Bon appetit, ma dame. Does it.. suit your tastes?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

You can definitely keep the Frittata Expert™ title you earned during your two year frittata marathon.&quot; And then she tucked in with eagerness, occasionally making a small pleased sound as she ate with happiness.

Cain was quiet for a moment, focused on eating and quickly clearing her plate of her first portion. As she acquired another slice, Cain looked at Yarrow. &quot;Does cooking it remind you of medical school?&quot; she inquired with a casual tone. He&#39;d said at the bar that his combinations had gotten creative, so maybe a standard set of vegetables didn&#39;t quite bring the same nostalgia. 

As she continued nibbling on her second slice, she finished her earlier efforts at starting a pot of tea, setting it to brew while they ate. She&#39;d found a breakfast blend, and was eager to add caffeine to her morning.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sometimes it was worth it to feed the nostalgia beast.

He looked back over at her question, pausing briefly before nodding. It was a casual question, and she knew far worse things about him, there was no need to hide the comparatively small vulnerability. He let out a sigh, closing his eyes for a moment as he thought back and indulged the memory.
&quot;It does, yeah. Med school was... demanding, often. I was lucky enough to have my own room, but had to share a communal kitchen with some other students. It was hard to find the time to go prepare food all the time... someone might already be cooking, and more than once it was completely unusable due to the mess. So I decided to learn how to make something that was easy, but also made a lot of food so I could limit my kitchen use.&quot;

He gestured to the frittata he&#39;d made with a chuckle. &quot;This tastes better than some of the ones I&#39;ve made, though, even when I was making them every day.&quot; he took a sip of wine, watching her begin some tea. &quot;What about you?

It sounded quite stressful, and she thought it spoke a lot about him that he&#39;d navigated it all successfully. &quot;We sent some of my more academically inclined guildmates to apprentice with potion makers and a couple to medical school itself. The entire process seemed exhausting. I never had the brains for it myself.&quot; Cain ended her statement with an easy grin, matter of fact about her own skill set and clearly not self conscious about the assessment.

As he asked about her cooking skills, Cain audibly laughed. &quot;I&#39;m also pants at cooking. My last guild provided meals, and I didn&#39;t even have a kitchen in my rooms. Not that I was there much... I spent most of my weeks on the road.&quot; She paused, a flash of sadness in her eyes, before continuing with a slightly modulated tone. &quot;My mentor taught me to make the dish I usually have when camping. That&#39;s really the only thing I can reliably make.&quot; She paused again, eyes distant for a second before shaking her head and turning to the gift basket and nodding at it with a smile. &quot;I&#39;ll be a local at all the restaurants and bakeries in town before long. I&#39;m used to eating out.&quot;

With her second slice of frittata consumed, Cain began finished the tea preparations. She pulled the steeping hopper out of her teapot and acquired some mugs from the cabinets. &quot;There&#39;s extra if you want some. I thought it might be nice with the bear claws. Plus, I can&#39;t tell if I&#39;m slightly hung over or under caffeinated, so going for both solutions at once.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Then again, things had felt far simpler then. His purpose was far clearer. It was easy to lose yourself in your work when you believed in it. It&#39;s why he&#39;d ended up making a good cultist in the end, he&#39;d been good at believing. Cain&#39;s grin drew him out of his musing and he flashed her a smile at the self-tease. He listened thoughtfully as she explained her relationship with cooking as he took bites of his own slice. Her life at the guild was so different from his, sometimes the new bits of information he learned raised more questions than they answered.

He noted that shift in tone that came with complicated feelings and the like before she reigned it in. Noted, but left unmentioned, other than an affirming nod from where he leaned and a slight scooch closer. Following her mood back to normal he chuckled, eyes glinting a moment. &quot;You are? Niamh will be happy.&quot;

Taking another bite from his frittata (eating much slower than Cain had) he considered the tea before reaching instead to raise his wine glass. &quot;This&#39;ll suffice for me, thank you. Caffeine has fallen off as far as my vices go... Was a bit of hell breaking free of a daily coffee or three, but.. well, I can&#39;t say my liver is happy about it, but my liver can suck it. Alcohol is.. a bit of a requirement for me nowadays.&quot; It was a casual way to admit his addiction, but it wasn&#39;t like he really hid it to begin with.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Their demons were different, but they both seemed to be chased by large ones... and while she&#39;d never wish a burdensome past on a friend, she was grateful for the camaraderie in the moment. 

At his double entendre, Cain barked a laugh, thoroughly pulled from the fog of memories by her amusement. &quot;I aim to please.&quot; She followed up with a smirk, and the faraway look in her eye was decidedly positive this time as she picked up a bearclaw and began nibbling on it. She was getting full, but knew she&#39;d want the energy for training later today.

In her easy, accepting way, Cain nodded, understanding Yarrow&#39;s habits a little better after Ezekiel and their game. She topped off both their wine glasses with a careless shrug. &quot;I have not lived the kind of life that gives me any grounds for critiquing others&#39; habits.

Though he was not often one to make wide declarations of allegiances or vows to stick by someone’s side through thick and thin (despite two notable exceptions) at the very least he felt like it was worth considering, if Cain asked. She hadn’t though, nothing more than his companionship in the here and now, and <em>that</em> he would certainly give as freely and as often as possible.

“Mine too,” Yarrow admitted wryly, muttering a soft <em>thank you</em> as she topped off his glass. “You’re welcome to tease me for it, if judging isn’t your thing. I won’t hold it against you unless you want me to.”

He picked at his frittata, eyeing her bear claw for a moment before moving back to his muffin for another bite. A roll of his shoulders and a stretching hum, he cleared his throat before speaking up again inquisitively. “So, what’re your plans for the rest of the morning? Anything fun?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Even then, she hadn&#39;t imagined the full depth. The extent to which it had deepened went well beyond simple physical compatibility, although they didn&#39;t lack there. No, it was more a meeting of like-minded individuals. It felt easy to be herself, something she didn&#39;t take for granted. She shifted a little, not knowing what to do with this depth of revelation, mentally putting a pin in it to revisit later, and focusing on what Yarrow was saying.

She smirked as Yarrow mentioned teasing. &quot;Oh, but I can think of so many more interesting ways to tease.&quot; She blatantly looked him up and down, clearly checking him out, raising her eyebrows in a salacious fashion. &quot;I promise to make it very worth your while.&quot; The glint in her eyes at the statement implied that she too would enjoy said teasing.

Bear claw thoroughly picked apart, Cain meandered over to the sink to wash the icing off her hands. She turned to answer Yarrow&#39;s question as she scrubbed the sugar off. &quot;I try and do a spot of training most days. The weight of that scimitar doesn&#39;t heft itself.&quot; She joking flexed an arm as she toweled her clean hands off. She stared off into the distance, checking her mental to-do list. &quot;At some point I need to find an apocathary or some places to buy potion making ingredients. I&#39;m low on a few things I find handy to keep made, as well as a few things to mitigate the side effects of owning a uterus.&quot; Knowing that Yarrow was a doctor, she figured he wouldn&#39;t be squeamish with that kind of detail.

She shrugged as she rejoined Yarrow. &quot;I don&#39;t ever really end up with a lot of formal plans outside of missions and mostly train out of boredom. Any time you&#39;re up for a distraction of any kind, come find me; it would be most welcome.&quot; Her tone was casual, but the stillness of her body and the intensity of her expression gave away how honest she was being.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He enjoyed the attention, especially as it came with the promise of teasing. &quot;You are free to tease me <em>whenever</em> you like.&quot; He purred in agreement, his eyes giving her a similar treatment for just a moment.

He took a slower, longer sip of his wine as Cain went through her plans for the day. It all sounded useful and important maintenance things to do. She was right in that he wasn&#39;t squeamish about the personal details. He&#39;d certainly seen and heard worse before. His expression had shifted from that teasing grin to a more thoughtful frown; as useful as her day&#39;s itinerary sounded, none of it was particularly interesting to him other than a general baseline of curiosity. Though watching Cain train certainly had its appeal, the possibility of being dragged into a spar after so fresh a trip outweighed the novelty. For now. Maybe when his feet stopped aching.

He nodded in understanding as she rejoined him, a smile creeping back onto his face at her open-ended invitation. Setting his plate down, he wrapped his now-free arm around her as she rejoined him, giving her a tight squeeze. &quot;I will <em>definitely</em> take you up on that. Who knows, you might come home and find me warming your bed for you... and that&#39;s not to say I won&#39;t sniff you out during the day if things get boring. You definitely know how to make things interesting, and I&#39;d be an idiot to not take you up on that.&quot;

He paused. &quot;Probably not today though. You can go work out and have fun swinging a weapon. I&#39;m going back to the bathhouse and soaking for a few hours.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She rested her head on his shoulder, idly slipping her own arm around his waist in a subconscious mirror of his pose. When he mentioned warming her bed, murmured something that might have been <em>yes, please</em> before following up. &quot;Don&#39;t make promises you don&#39;t intend to keep.&quot; Her voice was a low, seductive purr, the arm around his side tightening briefly before her fingers danced a pattern over his hip before dipping in and lower, teasing but never quite touching what she had so thoroughly explored the previous night. 

As Yarrow mentioned soaking for a few hours, it dawned on Cain that really, only her hair had been fully washed. &quot;We did rather get distracted from a proper bath, didn&#39;t we. I could definitely be persuaded to meet you after my workout. It would be nice to see the bathhouse during the day as well.&quot; She laughed, a fond smirk as she remembered their illicit entry. &quot;Nothing else on my list won&#39;t keep until later this week, if you&#39;re interested in the company. But if you&#39;d rather soak in solitude and decompress from our long trip, perhaps I&#39;ll be lucky enough to find you here later this evening.&quot; Her tone was playful and easy going, not wanting to pressure Yarrow either way. 

Her hand at his hip had slipped under his borrowed shirt and was lazily tracing patterns again. She stretched up and gave the corner of his mouth a kiss, close enough that if he turned his head, he could capture her lips fully.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Oh, but would her hand dip lower..! He <em>had</em> said she could tease him whenever he liked, but damn if standing next to her wasn&#39;t nearly enough for him to throw her back on the bed and damn the rest of a productive day. Amusement toyed his lips a moment as he imagined what everyone else might say with the pair so freely handsy. Or perhaps this was simply something he got to enjoy in private. That was fine, he reasoned, he could keep it as a fun little treat if Cain wanted it that way. If not... well, he wouldn&#39;t be too upset if they got kicked out of a place or two for being too salacious for the public.

The thought of her joining him briefly pulled his mind to a more conscious thought, still mired and blending her suggestion of taking a proper bath together with his wayward thoughts. &quot;Oh, definitely, I wouldn&#39;t dream to say no to company.&quot; He purred in quick agreement. &quot;If you&#39;ll be joining me, I&#39;ll come cheer you on at the training grounds. Not like I have anything to do that I can&#39;t do later.&quot;

Although, he <em>should</em> go say hi to a few people. If he was attempting to befriend Luka, at the very least he should go chat him up.. Maybe convince him to join him on a lunch date. And then there was Mahva... Cain&#39;s little kiss to the corner of his mouth earned a smile. His head twisted enough to return the gesture, not quite connecting lips while his own hand snuck under her shirt in a teasing revenge. &quot;Remind me to introduce you to some friends of mine later.

Cain gave him another smoldering look before sipping from her wine glass, presumably musing on different ways to make her daily sparrings a little more evocative.

As Yarrow slid under her shirt, Cain refocused her attention to his movements. When she understood the direction Yarrow&#39;s hand was going, her breath hitched and caused her chest to jump under his fingertips. <em>The fun thing about the game of teasing is that everyone wins</em> she thought a little dizzily, thoroughly distracted from planning and focused entirely on Yarrow&#39;s touch. She half-stifled a whimper at Yarrow&#39;s gently returned little kiss. It took her a moment to realize he had offered an introduction. &quot;A friend of yours is likely a friend of mine, especially if they&#39;re the type to come to mind when your hand is… wandering.&quot; Her voice was a little breathless, and her eyes fluttered closed as she concentrated on the feeling of his fingertips.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The movement of her hands and her words were the best kind of torture, and though his blood ran hot under her teasing, her words promised even more fun in a way that piqued his curiosity. Was he up for a friendly wager? What else did he have left to lose? He almost took back his decline for sparring today, only reserving from the ache still ready in his heels. “Well, when you say it like <em>that,</em> consider me fully interested in a friendly wager or two.” He said, idly licking his lips as she drank her wine.

Yarrow’s hand gently massaged Cain’s skin, his lips finding purchase on her jaw with a pleased smile. Her reaction had been just what he’d wanted, and he also appreciated her coherency despite it. Her vocal support of branching out into his friend group was a pleasant relief, even if the number of people he actually considered friends numbered less than one hand. “At least one is, and I’d be more than happy to share him with you.” His voice crooned lowly into her ear.

He pressed a final kiss, murmuring a quick “good girl” that was accentuated with a tantalizing squeeze before he pulled free. In part, it was to put away the food, and also to clear some of his head. If they were going to be out in public, he needed to at least <em>pretend</em> to be decent for a little while. While he busied himself he cast the occasional glance over his shoulder at her as he gave her a brief run-down. “Mahva’s a yuan-ti, very handsome and <em>very</em> good at his job. He dances a lot at the Inn, so you’re bound to run into him eventually either way. Luka’s actually Jaska’s brother. He’s not into any of <em>this”</em> -Yarrow paused briefly to make a suggestive gesture- “but he’s got an excellent massage parlour in town that’s worth checking out. Perfect place to stop at after a long trip out into danger. Both are excellent lunch dates as well.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Yarrow had gotten far too good at pressing her buttons rather quickly. As he spoke, she gently kissed one of the love bites on his neck, teasing the sensitive flesh. When she heard &quot;good girl,&quot; her breath jumped again, and she opened her eyes, pinning Yarrow with an intense look. Oh, what she wouldn&#39;t give to make him say that again.

With a little whine at his step away, Cain shook her head, attempting to focus. She finished the last of her glass of wine, and began bussing their dishes to help Yarrow&#39;s cleanup endeavors. She nodded as he described Mahva and Luka, listening with keen interest.

In truth, Yarrow&#39;s offer to introduce her to his friends resonated something deep within Cain&#39;s soul, something she hadn&#39;t even been aware of lacking until its absence was pointed out. Her travels had taken her to many places, and she&#39;d met many folks over the years, but none she&#39;d consider a friend or more than a passing acquaintance. The slog of constant travel and continual rotation of new faces, never a connection more profound than surface level introduction and conversation… Her eyes lit on the basket from Niamh, and Cain keenly felt that same resonation deep in her soul. Yes, here in Fielbarry, Cain felt the strength of contrast, a stark sense of belonging that had been missing from her path for a long time. She took a deep breath, and looked at the table, knowing her emotions were probably written on her face. She took another breath, composing herself.

&quot;I would love to meet them. They both sound lovely, in their respective ways.&quot; She was proud of how even her tone was, and continued softly, &quot;It means a lot that you would offer.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1133218976080592916 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1133218976080592916><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, July 24, 2023 7:07 PM">7:07 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She made her hands move again, the simple acts of tidying and repacking the basket for storage helping calm her the rest of the way down. As she cleaned, she smirked, an idea coming to her. She walked over to the table at her front door and rummaged in her things until she pulled out her small black notebook. Ripping a page out, she scribbled a quick note to Niamh.

<span class="chatlog__markdown-spoiler chatlog__markdown-spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)">Niamh, 
The muffins and bear claws were both delicious and greatly appreciated.
I think we might owe you a slice of morning after frittata. Next time, feel free to join us! 
Cain</span> 

After Cain signed the note with a flourish and a grin, she brought it over to Yarrow for his inspection. &quot;You want to add anything?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He&#39;d had that life before once, then again in facsimile of community while in the depths of fervor. Friends from his life before were scarcely remembered now, faces and names a distant blur behind years of imbibement and hedonism. He remembered far too much of those he once called kin, his brothers in arms in the name of The Lady. Did they ever actually like him, or was their common cause and devotion their sole point of community? He knew better.

No, Fielbarry <em>was</em> different. Though they gathered under the guild&#39;s banner, in truth their adventuring party was hardly a tight knit squad, just a few more mistakes away from dissolving spectacularly.. but it hadn&#39;t been all bad. There had been some kindling of kinship out there, and he dared say he wouldn&#39;t be opposed to hanging out with a few of the party on occasion. Not just because they were promised money for a job well done, but because they were <em>interesting.</em> Though he pursued Luka for salacious desires, he enjoyed his company even without it. He would even wager Mahva enjoyed some part of his company, even without the call of coin. Hells, he was considering just taking him on a regular <em>date.</em> Not to mention the ease he found himself in Cain&#39;s presence. Yes, the fucking helped, but even without it... he enjoyed her. It was an uncomfortable comfort he&#39;d have to wrestle with later, when he was willing to make the introspections of the changes in his life.

He knew it in Cain&#39;s voice, face, felt it. He let her speak for both of them while he finished wrapping up the food and sticking it away for safekeeping later. He wondered if she&#39;d have offered the same, in his position.

That was enough thinking. Yarrow&#39;s quota of genuine emotion sufficiently fulfilled (and even before noon, no less!) he chased them away with the rest of his wine glass, perking up curiously as Cain came back with the torn page. He gave it a read over, a slow smirk growing in approval at the short and sweet note. &quot;Oh yes, I&#39;d love to.&quot; He took a moment to add on a few scribbles of his own, his sloppy handwriting barely legible. <em>Doctors.</em>

<span class="chatlog__markdown-spoiler chatlog__markdown-spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)">Niamh,

&quot;Needed more enthusiasm,&quot; He grinned, flicking the pen back at Cain.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She rested her chin on his shoulder, letting out a quiet giggle as he wrote. After lifting her head to press her lips to his shoulder in an indulgent kiss, she teased in a voice warm and full of affection. &quot;You&#39;d think someone with such skilled and dexterous fingers as yours would have better handwriting.&quot; She let her eyes scan over his additions, nodding in approval, her grin growing with each edit.

Cain caught the tossed pen with catlike reflexes, and raised an eyebrow in challenge before laughing, enjoying Yarrow&#39;s playfulness. She slipped the paper out of his hand and began folding it. &quot;It&#39;s too bad I don&#39;t have lipstick quite so lovely to seal our note with,&quot; Cain said, gesturing to the elegant kiss mark Naimh had bestowed on the first letter. &quot;That would really give bonus points for enthusiasm.&quot;

Reluctantly, Cain stepped back, her free arm giving Yarrow&#39;s waist a little squeeze on the way. After setting their note on the entry table, Cain meandered back to her bedroom, double checking that Yarrow was following. She pulled out a loose outfit not unlike the sparring clothes Yarrow had first encountered her in at Daarka&#39;s warm up gathering. With graceful, unhurried movements, Cain began changing into her training gear. After a few daggers disappeared into various pockets and that seemed to complete her get up, she stepped closer to Yarrow and danced her fingers down a thorny bramble.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
<div class=chatlog__message-group><div id=chatlog__message-container-1133450954495242373 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1133450954495242373><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><img class=chatlog__avatar src="/icons/Woozy.png" alt=Avatar loading=lazy></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__header><span class=chatlog__author style=color:rgb(183,133,159) title=Woozy data-user-id=142049937473929217>Woozy</span> <span class=chatlog__timestamp title="Tuesday, July 25, 2023 10:29 AM"><a href=#chatlog__message-container-1133450954495242373>7/25/2023 10:29 AM</a></span></div><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Yarrow smiled at the warm tease, giving a light shrug so as not to disturb Cain from her perch on his shoulder. “Nobody’s perfect,” He chuckled, voice light and casual. As though his handwriting was the worst quality he posessed. Content with his additions, he watched her fold the paper, humming in agreement as she mentioned a tragic lack of lipstick. “Yeah, bit of a shame there. While your lips are more than capable of leaving a mark in their own way, I don’t think the paper would appreciate it as much as I have.” he mused, running a finger over one of his many blooming bruises.

Yarrow easily followed her back to the bedroom, pausing briefly to pick up his earlier-discarded scarves and swipe his things from the entry table as well. He settled against the wall as he re-wrapped his scarves and belts, eyes hungrily watching Cain re-dress in the familiar getup even as he slipped back into yesterday’s clothes. Well, mostly, he noted with a pleased glance at his borrowed shirt. He also noted where each of Cain’s daggers slipped away, just in case he were to ever need to borrow one of those later even as he stashed his away within the folds of his scarves. Usually they were hidden behind the loose drapes of his shirt, but now the gleam of hilts poked out from their nests telling quite loudly where they were. The glint of metal matched his re-adorned collection of necklaces.

His eyes lidded momentarily as her finger danced down a bramble, temptation rising once again to screw the day. He had a feeling he would never quite be free of that from now on. Humming, he swung an arm out to slide around her waist to pull her close to his side, beginning to guide them towards the door. His fingers ever played with the hems of her clothes, but they behaved. For now. “I believe I’ve somehow forgotten the way to the training grounds. Miss Cain, would you <em>ever</em> so kindly be willing to show me the way?” He lied in faux grandeur, batting his eyes with a teasing grin.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Dressed and equipped, she slipped on a pair of thin leather shoes that looked almost like dancer’s shoes, clearly meant to prioritize the wearer&#39;s connection to and tactile sensation from the ground. She bounced on the balls of her feet for a moment, testing fit, before acquiring her final weapon. Cain picked up her scimitar, turning its weight over, muscles in her forearms rippling. With an easy movement, she rested the sheathed blade over her left shoulder in a practiced, habitual pose.

As Yarrow slid in at her right side, her calm expression broke momentarily with a small, secret smile. He was still wearing her shirt, and she would never dream of stopping him. She situated herself firmly against his side, pleased as ever at his tactile, physical affection as his hands roamed slightly. She stayed there as they moved through the guild halls and out into the streets, uncaring of the looks they got for being so linked together outside of her private rooms.

“In this alone, I’m probably the best tour guide,” she joked, swaggering her hips a bit but not enough to pull out of his grasp. “I’ve spent a decent amount of time destroying practice dummies there, I’d better know how to find it.” Her eyes glinted a moment. “Maybe if you’re lucky, I’ll show you something most people don’t live to see the end of. It’s a technique I’ve trained in since I was a young girl.” Her voice was low and serious, not trying to threaten Yarrow specifically by any means, but rather simply the tone of someone speaking about something dangerous. “We used to be known for our shadow dance, but passing the technique down has turned fatal a few too many times. My old guild outlawed it a while ago, but I’ve always appreciated things with an element of danger.” Cain eyed Yarrow out of the corner of her eye, thinking of her fascination with the brambles in his hair.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Emboldened by the comfort, his thumb more solidly hooked into the hem of her pants again in a way that was playfully possessive even as the swagger of her hips nearly teased it free; his thumb hooked in all the more, just to be safe.

He let her guide the pair through the halls, eyes crinkling with amusement as she regaled him with her prowess. Of the two of them, she certainly was the more certified for finding the training grounds. A brow quirked with curiosity at the mention of a special technique and the weight her lowered voice gave it. He leaned in a smidge in conspiracy as he listened, eyes fully focused on her as she explained this shadow dance and its lethality. Her appreciation for dangerous things earned a sly smile, that glint mirrored in his eyes. &quot;Oh baby, you know I love a little danger. I admit, I&#39;m <em>desperately</em> curious about what makes it so deadly that even <em>training</em> in it can lead to fatalities.. enough that get it outlawed, even.&quot;

There was no surprise in his eyes that she was good at it. He&#39;d seen her fight and he knew full well that she was incredibly capable. Without much more to go on his mind tended to wander towards the fantastical, briefly imagining a flurry of blades that incorporated her natural tendency towards chaos during battle. All that was left was the waiting for the reveal, not too unlike their night before. The sun interrupted his musings, face souring into a small grumble as a hand raised to block some of the light. &quot;I don&#39;t suppose this <em>shadow dance</em> can turn off the lights, can it?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She blushed a little at his term of endearment, but gamely inclined her head to match his, raising an eyebrow alluringly. &quot;Ah, my dear, but that would be telling. I&#39;m a big fan of <em>showing</em>. As to why it was outlawed… you&#39;ll have to earn that information.&quot; Her lips brushed his ear by the end of her statement, her voice low and sultry. She let him use his imagination as to what might be the best method of earning; she&#39;d greatly enjoyed his creativity thus far.

With light, excited footsteps, Cain&#39;s feet were just short of skipping as she led them unerringly to the training grounds, hoping they&#39;d have the place to themselves, at least for a bit. She wasn&#39;t exactly sure she&#39;d want to reveal her full capabilities to others, but Yarrow, she wanted to impress. As they strode into a patch of sun, Cain giggled at his grumble. She secured her scimitar on her back, mindful of the arm around her waist. She gave the hand at her hip a squeeze before raising her hand to block the sun and shade his eyes. &quot;I think turning off the sun is a little beyond my magic, but here&#39;s my normal shadow.&quot;

As they approached the training fields, Cain steered them to a back, ill-used corner where she often went to practice. Presumably someone with guild authority had noticed her using it, as a small supply shed on the way seemed always stocked with aforementioned training dummies. She ignored the shed today, as what she was hoping to demonstrate didn&#39;t actually need an opponent. Otherwise, she was pleased to note, they were alone. 

This particular training field was a smaller one, perhaps 40 ft across, although the parameter wasn&#39;t a perfect circle. Ringing the cleared area intended for combat were a smattering of 25 or so trees, placed seemingly at random. Cain nodded, pleased with her choice. She gave Yarrow a roguish grin, and with a quick peck on the cheek, slipped out of his grasp and headed to the center.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
