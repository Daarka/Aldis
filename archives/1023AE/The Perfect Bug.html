Except she wasn&#39;t running today, but rather walking slowly in a purposeful crouch, squinting... well, everywhere. Nothing escaped her peeled peepers, not walls, not the ground, not a stray dog passing through digging for scraps.

She crouched by the side of the road, nails prying free discarded rocks that had long merged with the mud and dirt to check underneath. No, nothing? She set it back, patting the rock before practically crabwalking further down the side of the road, not even bothering to stand up from her sprawl-legged crouch to harass another rock for its secrets.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Another figure eyed Cairn as she crouched and pawed through the path, not with judgement but open curiosity. 

Off to the side of a bush, or perhaps a sapling was Koa. Standing at a little over 7 feet, with soft peach skin and tomboyish tufts of unnatural deep blue hair, she did not make for an imposing figure. Her sweater was clearly meant for a being much smaller, and while it had been let out to cover her still exposed her midriff. Slacks had been tailored more neatly to allow for her rope like bovine tail to whip behind her in obvious attention that matched her narrowed green eyes. 

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; She would finally ask, if Cairn hadn&#39;t immediately spotted her just existing because shes...Kinda pink.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But hell if she wasn&#39;t doing great at it. She blinked up as Koa spoke, head craning back from the combination of added height and Cairn&#39;s best slav-squat impression.

Though she was shoeless, she had thought to at least wrap her feet in simple wraps to help keep away <em>some</em> of the chill, but not too much so she couldn&#39;t squish her toes into any opportune muddy spots. She wore a vest that looked a little thicker and more embroidered than usual, though still distinctly handmade with perhaps more care and precision than her usual outfit implied she used. Her arms were bare, sleeves rolled up to keep out of the dirt. The fur ruff that usually hung around her shoulders sat on her waist like a fuzzy belt, the little tail dragging behind her.

The question earned a wide grin and a hand gesturing enthusiastically for Koa to crouch down with her. &quot;I&#39;m looking for bugs! Do you wants to help? Only the best will do!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The wide grin and open posture was inviting, never mind the canines that might seem a little too prominent on Cairn if Koa dared to look too long. Eye contact was hard.

&quot;Is it size?&quot; The large woman asked, plucking the end of a log with the tips of her finger tips to tilt it upward and start to shake it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her strength and size was impressive, Cairn was immediately pleased at her skills, mentally noting Koa as Junior Bug Searcher.

&quot;Size <em>is</em> good with bugs, but it&#39;s also about which bugs makes your heart speak the big happiness. I like grubs, their little leggies are fun. Mine sister likes beetles though; that&#39;s who I want bugs for.&quot;

She swiped a hand across the log, raising a grub to her face for inspection before her mismatched eyes looked back at Koa and she pointed with the bug at her. &quot;What bugs are <em>your</em> best bugs?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Strong, slow. Seem cautious.&quot; Koa answered after another sizeable pause. She would have been pleased as punch if she could hear Cairn&#39;s thoughts but instead wrinkled her nose for the moment. 

&quot;Grubs seem like a strange choice but they do squish well. Oh! Mantis also.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Maybe we find a mantis for mine sister then.&quot; Cairn nodded excitedly, though she scrunched her face. Digging through the dirt and upturning rocks was fun and all, but if they wanted a mantis, they&#39;d probably have to change locations.

&quot;Mantises don&#39;t likes sleeping under rocks and logs, do they? They&#39;re more... up. On like trees and buildings and such.&quot; She immediately stood, shooting back up to her whole 5&#39;5&quot; height to look around with renewed interest.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Koa momentarily felt a little irrational shock of shame at forgetting but nodded in quick agreement. It still hadn’t crossed her mind to properly introduce herself and instead she was hurrying on with Cairn’s suggestions. 

“Right! Your sister. You have a sister? How come she isn’t out here and getting bugs as well? Not everyone really enjoys them. You wouldn’t be looking if they didn’t like bugs! I’m just surprised to see someone else out…” 

It almost surprised her to see Cairn stand straight at 5’5. Somehow her confidence made her seem bigger. Koa could swear there was an outline there that looked mountainous. Shyness was melting away, too. This was absolutely important and there was no time to shrink away.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Someone who could keep up! She nodded again at the mention of her sister, stepping away from the rocks over to a nearby building to examine the wall for any stray mantises chillin. Despite Koa&#39;s couple feet of height on her Cairn carried herself with her usual confidence; either she was always like that or used to being around people taller than her. Or both. It was probably both.

&quot;Yes! Mine sister&#39;s name is Binah! She&#39;s back home up north though, she&#39;s too little to travels this far.&quot; She paused, then clarified &quot;I&#39;m froms the Kurul Taiga, south side. Very pretty there, you been?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Clove&#39;s head today was adorned with an oversized Cremini mushroom, smooshing their wild hair down and functioning as a sunshade/large brim hat.

Clove skipped with delight, catching sight of a friend crouching and inspecting a rather choice dirt patch. Clove began hurrying, eager to assist in whatever investigation was occurring.

&quot;Cairn hello I found a fern hi I&#39;m Clove&quot;

Forgetting such things as common sentence structure in their excitement, Clove greeted their friend and introduced themselves to the unfamiliar face all in the same breath.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Binah is a very pretty name and I have been there! I…Uh…I camped there!” Trying to figure out the words for what she’d been doing there before. 
“Working? Camping? A guide, with someone I know-“ Another voice leapt in and Koa had to fight the rising urge to retreat. 

Quickly one hand went down to her tail, twining her fingers into the dark blue fluff there and managed an abrupt smile as she at first mistook fern for friend and tumbled her own introduction. 

“I’m Koa! Hi! Oh, you are Cairn, that’s great! What a great name. So we are finding mantises and other bugs still, nothing wrong with that. Nope nope.” Her voice rose just one pitch as she had to quell her anxiety.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The larger entity was, of course, Kaskra, come to watch what people were up to at night. He wasn&#39;t exactly made to deal with any kind of chill and was fairly heavily wrapped up compared to his usual no-pants-policy, though his cloak still provided a recognisable sillhouette to everyone.

Clove turned to address a nearby bush with their favorite Speak With Plants spell. However as Clove spun, they caught sight of Kaskra and his chicken.

Before she could enthuse further, she looked over her shoulder at the sound of a chicken and the lack of a sound from Kaskra. &quot;Kaskra!&quot; She announced with that same grin.

She reached out to give the chicken a little scritch, briefly enamored. Conveniently that left her close enough to read his chalkboard. &quot;We&#39;re hunting bugs! I wants to be giving mine sister a mantis, but any best bug will do.&quot;

She gestured to Koa with a sense of pride. &quot;This is Koa, mine Junior Bug Searcher. She&#39;s very good. We just met!&quot;

Clove gleefully pulled a fat, wriggling earthworm from a nearby patch of damp earth. The scent of the dirt was rich and seemed full of life, as though a gentle but steady rain had fallen here and the ground had yet to dry out entirely in the following days.

Clove solemnly offered to the worm to Nugget, and took their slow, ponderous time to read Kaskra&#39;s writings. Clove knew it took them a long time to read, and hoped that the lizard didn&#39;t mind. As Clove read, they sounded out some of the longer words, providing a slightly piecemeal but interpret-able summary of Kaskra&#39;s writing.

&quot;A beehive nearby! Have you ever harvested honey?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At least his handwriting was neat, maybe unusually so.

At Cairn&#39;s statement, Clove looked up, squinting into the night and letting their darkvision take over. Quickly being distracted by the stag and sparing no thought to the darkness beyond, Clove brought their hands together gently. In a blink, Clove Wild Shaped into a genteel doe. 

Clove-the-deer pranced elegantly after the stag, moving slowly closer so as not to alarm the other creature, snorting in a friendly manner as their hooves made muffled sounds against the forest floor.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He used a long birch quarterstaff as balance for his bad leg, the top wrapped with leather and a sprig of mistletoe, and his raspberry red eyes were framed by delicate-looking wire framed glasses.

It didn&#39;t seem to react to Clove&#39;s exclamation, though a very subtle movement turned its massive head a fraction.

But for such a large creature, there was no sound. Not even the deep huffs of air as presumably massive lungs breathed. Just complete and utter silence, wherein even Clove, up close as they were, would have a hard time fully making sense of the shadowed shape.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That pale eye locked onto the lizardfolk, and the creature&#39;s posture shifted entirely. 

Smoothly rising to its full height, an alien, bone-rattling sound rose from its chest, low and rumbling like a growl. Any assumptions about its prior body language being threatening were easily wiped away now in the face of <em>objectively</em> threatening posturing, as it moved with unnerving silence to wind its body in front of the tiefling, the gesture similarly protective as Kaskra&#39;s step around Clove had been.

That awful rumbling continued--not loud enough to drown out any speech, but deep and far-reaching, with those closest being able to feel the vibrations it sent through the earth. All the while, the pale eye that remained (which entirely lacked any form of a pupil) seemingly stayed pinned on Kaskra, an excessively long tail slithering into a loose curl around the tiefling druid. A keen eye would likely notice that at the end of this tail were three finger-like digits, each ending in a long and nasty looking talon.

Luckily for Clove, the cloak had been washed recently. He moved forward when she did to present the gifts, but never took his eyes off the beast.

However, he reached out in his own special way. Not so fortunately, he still had no control over the sensation it caused as his words telepathically filtered through. A sensation of being watched, as if something had suddenly become aware of his presence - though, perhaps, that wasn&#39;t as unfamiliar to the strange druid as Kaskra anticipated it to be. <span class="chatlog__markdown-spoiler chatlog__markdown-spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)">&quot;Why are you familiar?

It seemed nothing was going to reach through to him--but Kaskra&#39;s telepathy elicited action. 

With a rather grotesque, confusing motion, as if his form melted and sloughed off as black sludge, the massive beast was rapidly replaced with the anatomy of a man--taller than Kaskra (who was bizarrely tall for a gecko), and seemingly of drow heritage. He was dressed simply and in neutral tones, his feet bare, and his pale, spidersilk hair long and straight. But some of that monstrous visage seemed to persist in this form, as well, as his fingers ended in gnarled, long, unnatural claws--and half of his face was horribly marred. 

His left eye was pale, with faint hints of a lavender hue. But where his right eye should have been was instead a black void, untouched by the ambient light around them; the flesh around the socket, especially below it, was torn and ravaged as if by deep acidic burns, to the extent that most of his lips on the right side of his mouth were missing, leaving teeth (carnivorously pointed in a way that was just as unnatural as his claws, typical features of neither drow nor druids) bare in a permanent snarl. 

As soon as he had settled into this form, he was already speaking. What he was saying was anyone&#39;s guess, as it was all in thick undercommon, but it was <em>spat</em> with such aggravated vitriol that tone alone gave some indication of what it was. His voice was not particularly raised, and that bone-rattling rumble was <em>mostly</em> gone (though--again, rather unnaturally--it still persisted in a slightly quieter degree, originating from his now much smaller, but still sizeable, chest), but his defensive stance in front of Hiraeth remained, and his focus stayed squarely on Kaskra as he seemingly cursed him out.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1102017627573993555 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1102017627573993555><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, April 29, 2023 4:44 PM">4:44 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-spoiler chatlog__markdown-spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"> can never decide which piece i like better for him so take your pick.

With that, the lizard produced a notebook from somewhere inside the folds of his clothing.

He stared at them a moment, as if only just now properly processing that other people were also present. He didn’t look comfortable with that fact, but grit his teeth. 

“He is missing parts of mind,” he ground out, looking back to Kaskra then. “And what is left is full of foolish thinking,” he added, a bit more sharply. 

“There is no <em>keeping other safe</em>. How many have you harmed?” A wickedly clawed finger jutted to gesture to those around them. “You willing for all of this to die? Good price for you? Do you willingly sacrifice your mind? For what? For knowledge? Power? Secrets of world? These are worth nothing when your mind is consumed.”

It wasn’t a compassionate plea. The drow spoke with a seething venom, a hatred, his deep voice and thick accent somehow making the words feel heavier.

Drawing back up to his full height, his eye, narrowed, bore a hole in the warlock for a moment. “You have year. Maybe two. Less time if you remain stupid. It already begins to swallow you.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Why <em>did</em> he say yes back then? The previous remark was meant to agitate, but now he really had to try and remember.

With an agitated thump of his tail, he started writing again. &quot;<em>The circumstances behind the bond are less than ideal at times, but still.

It seemed to have a consistency that was thick like molasses (if not thicker), and its downward ooze was painfully slow, but at some point between the time he had shifted back to this form and now, it had begun to creep forward from the strange void in his socket, enough to be noticed. It followed the well-worn tracks of horrid scarring and ruined tissues down his cheek, like rainwater comfortably flowing down the paths of rivers its continuous fall had carved into the land.

He said nothing in response to the gith, nor did he take any action. He stayed firmly planted in front of Hiraeth, staring at the outspoken woman flatly; neither a taunt for her to make good on her threat, nor cowing to her demands. It seemed he had spoken his piece, and he didn&#39;t seem to desire to waste further breath on people who clearly refuted his words, though his grimly repulsed demeanor lingered in the wake of the conflict.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1102410693040406528 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1102410693040406528><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, April 30, 2023 6:46 PM">6:46 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__attachment chatlog__attachment--hidden" onclick=showSpoiler(event,this)><div class=chatlog__attachment-spoiler-caption>SPOILER</div><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1100215862687961189/1102410690972618783/SPOILER_28d91a7e137674f01820ea9f2d2f8126.png?ex=655aba76&amp;is=65484576&amp;hm=32e876ac6f457adfa0992e88c404a7c68fdd68e01efcce3574b3d3addbec1c40&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1100215862687961189/1102410690972618783/SPOILER_28d91a7e137674f01820ea9f2d2f8126.png?ex=655aba76&amp;is=65484576&amp;hm=32e876ac6f457adfa0992e88c404a7c68fdd68e01efcce3574b3d3addbec1c40&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: SPOILER_28d91a7e137674f01820ea9f2d2f8126.png (198.45 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

He seemed to glean just enough to presume meaning, especially with the second, more succinct message. And the change of apparent tone from Kaskra, the lack of defense of his pact and instead, some semblance of a desire to understand how to heed his warnings--while it did not completely wipe the ire and tension from the drow--did have a way of easing back some of the venom with which he spoke.

&quot;I do not know how you made pact. I do not know how you interact with it. But stop any of this activity. Find other places magic can draw from. <em>Do not give it want it wants</em>.

“If you do not know how to tell when you are giving thing, then you will not know what is lost. I did not say stop learning. I say stop feeding. Find what is difference. And stop using its power,” he rumbled. “Cannot weed it from mind if bond is maintained. Power given is lure. Like sweet poison to rat.”

By this point, most of the seething venom had bled out of him. What was left was still not quite what most would consider <em>friendly</em>, but was at least a demeanor Hiraeth was well accustomed to; his words were dry, his tone ever so slightly condescending, but in a way that seemed… more like a baseline than a conscious emotion. Like an exhausted parent who was sick and tired of telling their child to stop pulling their sister’s hair. 

His gaze slid back to Cairn, regarding her with the same unimpressed, lidded glare. “That is <em>what I think I know,</em>” he added with a much more prominently dry tone, the pointed sarcasm echoing a lingering but tired bitterness. And being a little childish, depending on who you asked. “Have your insect. And foolish decisions.”

He finally stirred to move, turning as if to step past Hiraeth in the direction moving away from Kaskra. He paused, though, leveling his stony stare down at the tiefling. 

“… <em>Stay away</em> from him,” he growled, though the rumblings in his chest did not quite seem to be a threat towards Hiraeth. “You are fool enough for being around me. But is wishing death to be around man who does not even know his danger. Do what you wish, but not close to him.”

His words were low and flat, directed at Hiraeth, but not particularly attempting to remain unheard by the others. He didn’t care if they listened; he had said as much to them, and they had all but unanimously rejected it. He also didn’t know or care about any of them. The absence of Hiraeth’s obedience on this singular rule was all he would lose sleep over.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
