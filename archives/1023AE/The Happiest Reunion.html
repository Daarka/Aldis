A helpful soul in the form of one of the priests, however, happily handed her the note he had left just for this.

&quot;<em>I&#39;ve decided to get some fresh air. Just follow the path out of town until you reach the river. You&#39;ll find me somewhere along the banks, just look for the fire.</em>&quot; Along with it came a crudely drawn map - likely to give cartographers a heart attack, but more than enough for simple directions. Perhaps somewhat nostalgic as well, depending on one&#39;s personal experience with hand-drawn maps.

And indeed it wouldn&#39;t take long for her to find the path or trail towards his makeshift camp. With a small lean-to set up between some trees, and a comfortable fire crackling a few feet away, it seemed fairly well set up. The remains of a meal were also evident by the skewers discarded by the side of the fire - mushrooms again, by the look of it - though once again the older sailor seemed absent. Another look around would instead find him by the river itself, humming, stripped to the waist and tending to the burns he had sustained in the trip to the castle.

Seeing him this calm, this quiet, may simply add to any observer&#39;s confusion if they had known him a little over a decade ago. At least the tattoos evident on his back and arms made it clear that he was still physically the same individual, albeit aged and faded with time. 

At that moment it seemed he still had yet to notice any company, instead focused on the faint blue-green light he traced with his fingers along the burns and scars, wiping them away as easily as spilled drinks.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It didnt take long to see why Meos chose this place to post up. In the dead of night when most people were either sleeping or committing various shades of shenanigans further into town, the gentle flow of the water soothed something long-yearning in her. She paused more than a couple times, crouching at the shore and letting the cool waters of the current flow between her fingers, promising herself that she&#39;d be back soon.

On spotting the steady burn of Meos&#39; campsite though, that old wariness spiked in her and she melted back into the shadows, watching from a distance. The familiarity was like a shock to the system - and for a brief flash of a moment she was once again Jasper, she was Nicnevan, she was a sly and wicked little bitch with slick sun-bleached hair and a knife between her teeth and a blade at her neck. And just as soon as it appeared, the memory shattered, and she was Niamh, she was wary, and she was running a hand idly along the base of her throat. She wondered briefly what Meos&#39; memory dredged up whenever he saw, but moved silently as she tugged off her boots and socks and rolled up the cuffs of her pants, wading a few inches in and letting her toes dig into the loamy riverbed.
&quot;You&#39;ve picked up a few tricks over the years, then.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Some o&#39; the more impressive ones aren&#39;t this flashy, either,&quot; he responded, unhurried and unbothered. Her presence, whether stealth had been intended or not, was also known to him quite some time before she spoke.

Gods bless wards.

He took his time tracing a final line along his chest, murmuring a word of thanks before finally fully turning his attention towards her. In the castle there was the adrenaline of the fight, the castle breaking down around them and the general presence of others to distract him from this unwanted reminder of the past.

Here, however? No such luck. It - or rather, she - was as large as life itself, and more than enough for him to no longer manage that lazy smile he&#39;d kept around the rest. Instead she was met with something halfway between nothing and apprehension. &quot;Ye&#39;ve grown. Scrawny little brat that ye were, I never thought I&#39;d see the day ye&#39;d fill <em>any</em> kind o&#39; space. How long has it been?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The fanged sneer that flashed across her face was reflexive, vanishing only when she scrubbed a hand over her jaw in an effort to reign in her focus.
&quot;Little over a decade if I&#39;m recalling correctly,&quot; she mused, her hands planted on her hips. &quot;Last I saw your face it was bruised from an unsuccessful evening in a tavern, after Meya hauled you out.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Of all the regrets, at least I know this one&#39;s got herself a place and she&#39;ll... survive.&quot;

Turning away again, he stretched. Several clicks and pops were heard as he twisted side-to-side and arms above his head, settling back onto his hands again. Now, at least, he seemed more relaxed. Still noticeable worse for wear, of course, but just knowing that the one member of the family he cared to think of was safe - in some capacity - was more than enough to shed a few years&#39; worth of worries in that moment. There were more questions burning in his mind, but for now he was content to leave them be.

When he opened the door for her to ask her own questions though, she found herself feeling hollow. The rumors of what drove Meos out of Castra Nica had been such a whirlwind of activity in town - a hot topic for people who didnt have personal ties to the victims, a devastating reality for Meya, and one that Niamh had supported her through. That lingering anger on the genasi&#39;s behalf is what had pulled Niamh back through years of her life, ready to loose that old fury on the source of ire. Now though? She just felt like a hypocrite. 
&quot;First of all, you&#39;re eight years older than I am, dont you dare start acting like an elderly man in front of me. That said I&#39;m... Just looking for an answer to an old question I guess.&quot; She even felt foolish for asking.

We drank, made merry, and then... I&#39;m not sure. Somethin&#39; they said, or did, or both, just...&quot; he shook his head, fists clenched in a white-knuckle grip. 

&quot;A fight happened. Same as any other, was my thought at the time, same as any brawl. Thought there&#39;d be bumps and cuts, maybe one poor sod or other that&#39;d bite it by the end. Didn&#39;t expect Le...&quot; the name stuck in the back of his throat and he choked. &quot;Didn&#39;t expect them to be the one, but they had a way of pushin&#39;, nagging at a point until I left in a fury or talked and thought it through.

Part of me still wonders why their death was such a bastard of a weight t&#39; carry.&quot; 

Eyes closed, head shaking, he added, &quot;Leslie deserved better. I left what I could with their kin for the best burial, but that was it. No looking back, just runnin&#39; like a bastard to get away from it all. No excuse for what happened, and no way to make it right, but Sen Rapa gave me a chance to make the world a little better and live the life me and them thought we&#39;d manage after enough was saved.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her memory flashed through the grief and shock of the twin that shared his face, every scathing look Meya had endured, every hasty whisper exchanged as she passed through town with Niamh on her heels snarling and snapping at gawkers. Looking at Meos now though, all she saw was a familiar brand of deeply rooted regret, and those last dredges of residual anger fizzled. She just nodded instead, wading through the water and letting it run through her fingers.
&quot;Its hard. Trying to be better, I mean, when the trench you dug yourself into feels like it&#39;s miles deep. I spent a lot of time wondering what the point would even be - what good could I possibly bring into the world that would balance out every atrocious sin that came before it?&quot; Her fingers found the smooth surface of a stone amidst the clay and she pulled it free, examining the geometry of it.
&quot;So far the answer has just been to find out one day at a time.&quot; A wide sweep of her arm and a flick of her wrist sent the stone skating across the water in a satisfying series of puddles.
&quot;I&#39;d wager you heard something similar on Sen Rapa? Was it the monks you ended up with?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He&#39;d have more than enough time for all the self-pity later.

 &quot;Can&#39;t say they didn&#39;t keep an eye on me, mind, but I wasn&#39;t the first soul to come and look for purpose. Do you remember what the devil said about me losing a colleague to plague?

Some of the tension dropped from her shoulders then, seemingly satisfied with the answers provided. Her weight shifted between her feet as she absentmindedly dug her feet further into the mud, and after a long moment managed to look back at Meos with a smile tugging at her lips.

But aye, in a way I am - and I do. I can&#39;t hold a candle to what some of the others can do, but meditation, at least, is a good way to refocus. Anytime I feel that itch at the back of my head, tellin&#39; me to hurt something? That&#39;s how I cope. It&#39;s not always in the way y&#39;think, either.&quot; To demonstrate, he stood and moved over to wade barefoot into the water.

Breathing deeply, he raised his hands - and with them, the water stirred. Slowly, methodically, his hands moved to the left, causing the water itself to reshape and flow as he moved, following his hands again as they flowed to the right. This time, however, his whole body moved and it became clear what he was doing - a routine of flowing gestures designed to mimic the fluidity of water, with intent and power enough behind it these many years later for the water itself to bend along with him.

&quot;It&#39;s a matter of findin&#39; what makes ye feel most at peace,&quot; he explained, slowly going through his set, &quot;For me, it was always the water. Suppose it&#39;s a bit too typical, but it&#39;s hard to deny nature.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lil Mans completed his descent as Niamh sloshed out of the river, alighting on the side of her head like a goofy taxidermied hat. Niamh herself seemed very much not to notice, more interested in Meos&#39; book than the scrambling in her hair and the tail wrapping around the back of her neck.

Fishing around in a pocket, he drew out a set of small hand-stitched dolls resembling a bear, a bull, a cat, an eagle, a fox and an owl. &quot;Each of these are enchanted for a different effect.

Turning, he made his way back to his fire, where he settled himself and readied what he needed for the night&#39;s tea. &quot;As far as reunions with old enemies go, this was good.

&quot;He&#39;ll get nothing of the sort, he&#39;s getting too fat to glide off the snacks everyone keeps sneaking him.&quot; A tiny objection broke the quiet of the night in the form of a short fart, and the scurried jump from the creature who had startled himself with it. Niamh only looked blankly ahead.
&quot;He&#39;s the worst.&quot;
Remembering herself, she set about returning her pants to their normal length and her boots to her feet, nodding briefly to Meos as she did.
&quot;Right. Rest well then, I&#39;ll see you in the morning.&quot; She hesitated then, taking a moment longer to brush herself clean and give Meos and his camp and his book another once-over.
&quot;And thanks for being straight with me. About everything that happened.

The last part, however, made him pause. He allowed himself a frown at that, looking down to the packet of leaves he held in hand as he thought of a response. Dead silence hung about the camp as Niamh jogged away, and the former pirate simply... stared. Minutes passed, then ten, then he clutched the packet in a white knuckled grip, looking for all the world as if he intended to hurl it - and possibly himself - into the fire, but with slow breaths he brought himself back and eased his grip on the poor tea leaves that had done absolutely nothing wrong in their lives.

&quot;Still a bloody brat...&quot; he muttered finally, head shaking with a half-smile as he went back to preparing his tea.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She did find herself wishing that they had installed curtains in the tree house windows as the sun finally shifted to shine directly on the pile of fur and feathers, but she relented and set about her business.
An hour and change, and one breakfast basket delivered to the Guild later, and Niamh was back to strolling along the river banks. Dressed in a much lighter set of loose shorts and a baggy shirt with the hem twisted into a knot for a better fit, she wandered the path from the evening prior with a pair of wrapped paper packages tucked into her arm.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His wards were reset, and a few too curious members of the local wildlife had been scared off before he settled in for sleep. Blessedly, his evening was void of dreams, and he could find comfort in the nothingness that held, waking up fresh and ready for whatever the day after held. Most immediately it held yet another round of tea, accompanied by a choice bit of foraging that yielded mushrooms, nuts and berries that more than suited his needs for a morning meal.

Though it did seem that he had lied just a smidge to Niamh about the exact timing of his  morning&#39;s routine. He started exactly as early as he normally did - just after sunrise. Time was taken to once again reapply the alarm wards, ensure the remnants of his fire were properly dealt with (gods know he didn&#39;t need to add arson of his new home to the list of sins), and nearby birds were tossed a few leftover berries.

He seemed content to make do with the river for his cleaning needs, however, and after spent a good amount of time going through the slow, meditative motions of the demonstration he had given Niamh the right before. That would be how she found him, as well - knee deep in the river, eyes closed as he followed a rhythm that played only in his head at the moment. If he didn&#39;t bear the tattoos and scars of his former life, one might have mistaken the man for an honest-to-goodness monk from some forgotten mountain village.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Plus, leaping from the floating castle perch without any clear magical assistance and landing unscathed - as well as being able to keep up with, if not outright <em>outrun</em> the members of the group on their trip back to their pay-giver was further evidence that something had changed beyond just the surface.

&quot;Thats fine though, we can follow the river a ways and use the bridges to make a circuit.&quot;
While she waited and warmed up,  the little leather slips of shoes lay abandoned as she seemed content to cover the intended route barefoot. Once Meos looked ready, she set off at a light pace to begin with, gesturing with her hands as she spoke.
&quot;So the Holbrook family is five people at its core - Stefan and Margret are Nils&#39; parents, Nils is Cassiana&#39;s husband, and Cha Cha is the childhood best friend and basically adopted son to Margret and Stefan,&quot; she began, her face lighting up with the chance to talk about her friends.
&quot;You might have seen Cha Cha or Nils or Cass around, they&#39;re pretty striking - big bear of a guy with an impressive ass, bright blue tiefling with lush ginger hair that&#39;ll put most women to shame, and a kinda petite woman with a hand made of smoke and scarring on her head,&quot; she explained, patting a hand onto the side of her head as the other moved in time with her gait.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

For his part, he simply donned a loose-fitting shirt and one pearl-and-feather bracelet before joining her. He seemed pretty content to be barefoot, as well, and kept up well, nodding as she gave a quick rundown of the family plus one. &quot;I see... aye, might&#39;ve noted the bear, though it may&#39;ve been a particularly hairy goliath gentleman as well. The other two don&#39;t ring any bells, though, but I keep an eye out for &#39;em.&quot; There was a pause as he looked around the sides of the path they had chosen to set off along, then he continued, &quot;So, what&#39;s their part in all this, then?

&quot;I&#39;m pretty sure Cass&#39; hand is a manifestation of her magic - she can throw it out and retract it, same as I&#39;ve seen some of you other magic types do. But they were the team that was with me and a couple others when we found Nuala up in Laracus, locked down in that lycan den. Given the way we left things I&#39;m pretty sure Roots&#39;ll be back soon with a follow-up mission.&quot; Her brow furrowed as she explained, her footfalls coming down a touch heavier as she chewed at the inside of her cheek.
&quot;Keep an eye out for that notice on the board. It&#39;ll be hard to miss, there arent many missions that either go that far north or get issued to hunt for lycans. Whether you want to get tangled in the mess is your prerogative though.

&quot;Nah, this is something more specific. The Siren&#39;s Song is a ship - and a problem.

That was one of the things we spent some time discussing last night, figuring out if we could use our friend Ezekiel&#39;s games and barters to send him off and eliminate the problem.

&quot;No, I get that.

&quot;Ah... Hm.

&quot;Aye, understandable. It&#39;ll be slow work, depending on what the shops have available, and what they need to make from scratch.&quot; Meos thought a moment, tapping at his chin as he checked the list in his head. &quot;Then again, it&#39;s nothin&#39; too big, so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they had them laying about already. Anyhow, let&#39;s get a move on. Bring yer lunchbars or whatnot and let&#39;s see what waits for us.&quot; And so, he set off for the training grounds.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
