Dying was a stressful ordeal, even if she hadn&#39;t actually spent time truly dead. So much had happened in such a condensed month of stress and grief and panic and horror, that in the months that followed, she and Kaleva were more than content just being homebodies. Taking whatever interim of peace the world would offer them and trying to recover some semblance of sanity.

The agoraphobia had started to lift, as had the separation anxiety. At least enough for Skena to take some modest ventures into town, grabbing a pastry once or twice, or running other similarly short and sweet errands. Just enough to function, never lingering too long. But over time, managing to stay out for longer and longer durations without devolving into a panic. Baby steps.

She had told herself she&#39;d be brave today, and so she had ventured to the library this time, intent on dwelling there long enough to freshen up her brain with new literature, and then scurry straight back home. Kaleva knew where she was, and she had assured both him and herself that she&#39;d keep out of sight where possible, with the both of them still desiring a low profile until their own issues had found resolutions.

Despite that, though, she didn&#39;t look particularly stealthy on this day. Instead of her usual dark robes, she was <a href="&lt;https://i.pinimg.com/564x/0e/ce/11/0ece111316ea3ad45ef7298750cfd49b.jpg&gt;">dressed</a> in a soft, pastel-peach dress with off-white sleeves and a turtleneck; just enough coverage to ward off the cooler weather creeping in, but still seeming to cling on to the idea of a summer that had left without her being able to truly experience and appreciate it. She had found a place to sit in a back room of the library, her legs curled up under her comfortably, and a messenger bag resting in her lap, out of which Gummy&#39;s head could be seen with his chin resting on her leg. He <em>looked</em> like he was snoozing, but it was unclear if he was even <em>capable</em> of that. He did look cozy, though.

Most people still had never seen Skena with a <a href="&lt;https://i.gyazo.com/b2597fdbd3fc4428ec1e79f51aba2536.png&gt;">halo</a>, but anyone walking in on her would be an exception. It was a gentle-looking thing, comprised of ethereal particles like an extremely fine glitter that shimmered with a soft, golden light around the crown of her head. The similarly soft colors of her dress and the angelic touch of the halo combined, and you could almost miss the part where her face was still that of a weird little colorless corpse girl.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As the harvesting had begun dying down to levels that could be handled easily by the farmers and their families without his help, he turned his idle hands towards other endeavors instead. Though he wasn&#39;t a frequent patron of the local library he was polite enough and prompt with what books he did borrow that he was a friendly face to those who worked there. A friendly face who always seemed willing to offer a helping hand, an offer that had previously been declined politely until now as the need arose.

Having received instructions about one of the shelves in the back room holding some of their more delicate collections getting a little too worn for their liking, he made his way in with the soft click of the door. Having vaguely remembered something about the delicate nature of the books inside and their sequestered location optimal for their preservation, he let the door close gently behind him to keep the turning of the seasons safely outside the room.

He blinked as his eyes adjusted to the room&#39;s simpler lights and lack of windows to see.. a young girl? It took him a second to parse just <em>who</em> he was looking at, so unused to seeing her in such bright colors. Or out and about for that matter, considering how long she&#39;d been keeping to herself these past few months. He barely noticed the golden crown as his eyes dipped to the comfortable form of Gummy tucked in close.

He stiffened with realization, a small grimace on his face. He too was wearing regular daily clothes, though his looked far more appropriate to the type of work he usually occupied himself with than something that was intended to be pretty or fanciful, simple pants, boots, and a laced off-white work shirt.

He cleared his throat, letting out an awkward &quot;.. Hi&quot; that was followed with a questioning squint. What <em>was</em> she doing back here? Reading? How nefarious.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Maybe a little too prepared for hell to come back for seconds.

But recognition set in, and that fight-or-flight reflex relaxed--though her brows knit slightly with a different kind of tension. 

Regardless of his intent, the combination of his flat greeting and suspicious squint was received loud and clear on her end as an indication that she should make herself scarce. Like a (much) bigger animal intimidating a (much) smaller one off a scrap of food; he evidently came in here and the vibe was that she should consequentially remove herself. At least, she was so deeply allergic to the idea of conflict that she didn&#39;t care the degree to which that was true. 

&quot;... Hi, um. Sorry, I&#39;ll... I&#39;ll get out of your way,&quot; she managed back, closing the book she had been reading without even making note of the page she was on, and setting it aside (it was a very dense academic text on carpenter bees). Gathering up her bag and minion so it wouldn&#39;t spill into chaos upon standing, she got to her feet, and skittered towards the door, intent on just slipping around him and away and going home early and--

The handle didn&#39;t turn. She hesitated. Tried it again, a little more firmly. It wasn&#39;t stuck, it was rigidly locked in place. &quot;A-Ah... Um. Did you lock this?&quot; Surely he would let her back out again.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He certainly wasn&#39;t going to protest, nor was he going to make it any more difficult on her. A quick squint of the book.. didn&#39;t yield much of anything, but that was something he was certain to just brush off to a less important corner of his mind as he actually got to work.

He paused his movement further into the room towards the shelves to turn towards her as she spoke up at the door. <em>Did you lock this?</em> The idea earned a snort and a shake of his head. &quot;No, I didn&#39;t.&quot; Why the hell would he want to be stuck in here with her?

He paused again, squinting towards the door. Maybe it was too big for her teeny tiny little arms? &quot;Here, I&#39;ll get it.&quot; He said, shuffling closer to the door again to show her how it was done.

But the handle didn&#39;t turn for him either, and he frowned. He tried again, a little more insistent that time, letting out a disgruntled noise.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Horror not based on who Cha Cha was, but simply the horror of being stuck in a place no one present wanted her in. Her social anxiety was piqued--but at least it was one of the less horrific circumstances for her to be stuck in lately.

In a library?&quot;

He could probably break it down if he had to, he reasoned, but he was here to <em>fix</em> things, not break it more. And if it was indeed enchanted to lock, he also didn&#39;t want to break the enchantment in case it was complicated (or expensive) to reapply.

He gave her a cursory glance before shrugging in polite indifference, turning his attention to the shelves he was actually here for in the first place. &quot;Well they <em>know</em> I came back here, so someone should come lookin eventually.&quot;

Not that he was <em>accusing</em> her of being back here without permission or anything. That&#39;d be rude. But suspicious minds did tend to wander for better or worse. Though he focused most of his attention on the shelf in front of him, one hand stabilizing it while the other prodded at the wood to assess its shape, he glanced back towards her. &quot;What were ya readin?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her features darkened in a blush colored like an ugly bruise as she abandoned the door, wandering aimlessly a few paces back to give Cha Cha more personal space again. At the question about her book, she glanced back towards it, giving a small, awkward little laugh.

&quot;Oh, um. Just... some studies on carpenter bees. It&#39;s... It&#39;s hard to find literature on some slightly more obscure topics like that, and the... the only one I&#39;ve been able to find is this old publishing.

Okay, sure, he didn&#39;t care for them too much, but at least it wasn&#39;t <em>necromancy.</em>

He let out a small sound of quiet judgement as she rambled to explain herself before apologizing for her intrusion. He closed his eyes a moment, letting out a slow exhale through his nose. &quot;... it ain&#39;t like it&#39;s really off limits,&quot; He started slowly. &quot;But I&#39;ve never been back here without asking first before. Apparently these books&#39;re sensitive, don&#39;t keep too well.&quot;

Like he was a frequent visitor or something, chastising someone who realistically read way more than he did on the nature of the books here. What was he going to say though, <em>It&#39;s ok, don&#39;t worry about it?</em> Nah. 

&quot;Well, since yer here, help me move these books off this shelf. It&#39;s cracked.&quot; He said, starting to pull some of the old tomes free gently.

She was a tiny thing, and didn&#39;t look much for physical labor in the slightest, but she made herself available willingly as much as she could, reaching to accept the books he handed off to her and neatly setting them aside. However, she only completed one armful of this, before turning back to him to accept the next batch--and jolting.

&quot;--Oh! Um. Uh. Is... Is that... Sorry, is that something you...&quot; She hesitated, looking deeply conflicted as she pointed sheepishly to the general direction of his back. &quot;... Um.

She looked very concerned about it, but didn&#39;t push on assisting him directly since he hadn&#39;t accepted the offer, staying back several paces and watching with a furrowed brow. 

There were some spots on one&#39;s back--especially for individuals with bulkier builds--that were virtually impossible to reach with one&#39;s own arms. But with enough flailing and stretching, Cha Cha <em>would</em> notice his fingers brush something unexpected. About where Skena said it would be, seemingly the size she was describing, strange in texture; a brush of--fur? Maybe something fleshy.

It was only as his fingers made contact that he realized something else, too. The push against the foreign body created a natural bump of pressure against his back, and that nudge suddenly made him aware that the region of his back had gone rather numb; he only felt the strange entity through the pressure of touching it between grasping fingers and the surface of his back, but couldn&#39;t feel it beyond that.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His brain scrambled for a split second before he turned his back to her, crouching awkwardly so she could reach up between where his hands couldn&#39;t grasp. She might be a necromancer, but she <em>was</em> a cleric, and she <em>had</em> pointed it out. Any reservations he had on the former were certainly overshadowed by his new but intense desire to be free of whatever it was that was on his back.

&quot;Get it off me,&quot; He wheezed in sharp panic, the hairs on his arms standing up.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It didn&#39;t take much groping around, her fingers closing around something--but when she tried to pull it, Cha Cha would feel a bizarre sensation as if what she was pulling was attached to his skin. Yet there was no pain accompanying that feeling. Only numb pressure. 

Skena&#39;s eyes widened at the unexpected detail, brows knitting further--but she knew her way around triage-type situations, and so the panic didn&#39;t derail her. &quot;H-Hang on, it&#39;s... latched on somehow, I need to make sure it&#39;s not going to damage you, I&#39;ll--I&#39;ll be quick,&quot; she explained, her hand still locked around the <em>thing</em>--which she could feel beginning to struggle--as her free hand tried to slide fingers between it and Cha Cha&#39;s back. 

It was all just numb pressure to Cha Cha. Hard to make out exactly what she was doing, just the occasional tug at his skin--in smaller degrees now, as she clearly seemed to be working to avoid pulling. Then, abruptly, a sensation of that pressure released, and Skena made a faint sound as her quarry separated from the man&#39;s back--and simultaneously lost its invisibility. 

She gawked at it for just a moment, before noticing the blood now freely gushing from a small, neat puncture in Cha Cha&#39;s back--though there would still be no pain on his end. With a little jolt at the sight, she quickly pressed her fingers back towards the wound, golden light blooming forth and almost immediately staunching the flow, sealing the little wound back up.

When she was confident the injury was properly addressed, she stepped back, looking towards the clumsily flailing creature in her grasp, which looked... frankly, like the unholy union between a bat and a mosquito. Leathery wings fumbled about, seemingly its only substantial limbs for movement with how swollen its abdomen had become, a smooth membrane stretched taut and practically see-through, with the presumed blood filling it coming through as a shiny ruby color. Tiny, black, insectoid legs seemed to be wiggling about from under its upper body, almost reminiscent of the anatomy of a tick, but they didn&#39;t offer much leverage even against Skena&#39;s small hands--which she was very carefully trying to negotiate away from the immense, needle-like proboscis extending from the tiny beast&#39;s presumed mouth, still stained in Cha Cha&#39;s blood.

She stared at it in abject horror (and maybe a little fascination, but mostly horror), not daring to loosen her grip whilst simultaneously looking very uncomfortable to be holding it. &quot;D-Did you, um... Go anywhere weird lately...?&quot; She ventured aimlessly, glancing up.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1170905303840211056 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1170905303840211056><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, November 5, 2023 5:59 PM">5:59 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__attachment chatlog__attachment--hidden" onclick=showSpoiler(event,this)><div class=chatlog__attachment-spoiler-caption>SPOILER</div><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1170858692514680842/1170905303525642350/SPOILER_Var.png?ex=655abd8a&amp;is=6548488a&amp;hm=7067e24f230d4b16439f8159b7de4136d1ca5687054627296410484bf5a67388&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1170858692514680842/1170905303525642350/SPOILER_Var.png?ex=655abd8a&amp;is=6548488a&amp;hm=7067e24f230d4b16439f8159b7de4136d1ca5687054627296410484bf5a67388&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: SPOILER_Var.png (1.42 MB)" loading=lazy> </a></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=chacham><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=chacham src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/685717497927958533.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>3</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

Perhaps in calmer circumstances he might&#39;ve appreciated the desire. Now, in the midst of it with absolutely no real <em>feeling</em> besides the subtle sensations of tugging - <em>Gods, if it&#39;s latched on, how isn&#39;t he feeling it? Why would it hurt to remove it?</em> - he was perfectly happy to be free of it as quickly as possible.

The release of pressure had him attempting to grasp at his back again, to try and pat at whatever numbness remained in a vain attempt to pap feeling into the area. Feeling nothing, he drew his hand back and noted a small trace of blood on his fingertips. That uncomfortable feeling in his gut sank deeper, and he spun to see... something he really wished had stayed invisible.

Cha Cha grimaced at the sight of the thing wriggling in her hand, his blood dripping from its dastardly mouth. Briefly he felt like throwing up but kept his composure. Kept it where it currently was anyways, the paranoia in his mind tearing through memories and potentialities of its origin still raised on a hair trigger. It took considerable self-control to not crush the thing where it squirmed, though that only stayed since she still had a grip on it.

&quot;Nowhere weird. Just.. in town, or out at some farms, in the woods... nowhere new. How long was... How long was that on me?&quot; He asked, though his mind also worried further. <em>What if there were more?</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

But she was right; they were not this small as far as he knew, closer to the size of imps. But... the similarities were certainly there. In a way, stirges, too, looked like the unholy union between a bat and a mosquito. But as he pictured a stirge in his mind, he couldn&#39;t help but note that stirges drank the blood they consumed, but it was not <em>visible</em> externally once it was drawn into their bodies. Unlike mosquitoes, ticks, and similar parasites, whose bodies swelled and could visibly be seen as having drank deep. Unlike what he was looking at in front of him now.

And as he stared at the strange creature, his thoughts drawing his gaze to that swollen, blood-filled abdomen, he noticed a subtle little detail. The glossy membrane encasing that ruby fluid gave the tiniest little wrinkles as the beast struggled, and... something about the way it wrinkled was strange. <em>Inorganic</em>, the word struck him as he watched. Less like a membrane or tissue, and more like unflexing plastic. And he very suddenly found himself drowning in the realization that he was looking at a <em>reimagining</em> of a stirge. As if some entity thought it could improve upon the design, perhaps.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And they actually <em>drink</em> what they steal, far as I remember. This one&#39;s stealin it.&quot;

He curled a lip in disgust, reaching a hand forwards the beastie with the intent of squishing its blood-filled abdomen. <em>That&#39;s not yours to keep.</em> &quot;Looks like the kinda shite that Dr. Stein likes to make.&quot;

Or someone else, though he kept those thoughts to himself for the moment. &quot;I ain&#39;t been that far north in a while though.&quot;

As if she didn&#39;t occasionally make rather cursed beasties--but in her defense, she considered <em>them</em> cute.

&quot;Even if I did make something that looked like this, I wouldn&#39;t make something that goes around attacking people. Or stealing blood. I don&#39;t really do any hemomancy--and even if I did, I&#39;ve never heard of hemomancers using <em>other people&#39;s</em> ill-gotten blood for their magic, it&#39;s pretty much always just their own.&quot;

With Cha Cha&#39;s panic not seeming to continue to rise, her squint towards the critter became more analytical. She had a good enough grip on it, and it seemed about as graceless as any other fat tick at the moment, that whatever danger it posed looked to be halted, so her curiosity was more and more creeping in.

&quot;... I can destroy it in a moment, I just... want to see if I can figure out what it is first,&quot; she offered, her free hand weaving a little somatic gesture in the air. As a result, a shimmer of golden light began to sparkle in front of her eyes, and she blinked twice, her gaze refocusing on the hellish enigma. 

&quot;... You have a good intuition,&quot; she announced hesitantly. &quot;... I thought it&#39;d just be some sort of natural beast, because it really only makes sense that it&#39;d be drinking some random person&#39;s blood if it was just a wild animal doing that to feed itself.&quot; A beat. &quot;... But this is a construct. It&#39;s...&quot; She hesitated, then carefully pivoted her hand to turn said construct so she could look closer without shifting her grip on it. Her free hand poked delicate, deft fingers in to lightly prod and explore the gnarly anatomy, pushing the wiry fur back, searching, until... &quot;... Yep, I see the seams.

He wasn&#39;t sure if its lack of &#39;cuteness&#39; was a deciding point that he believed her on, but.. well. She was weird enough anyways. And if it&#39;d been hers, she wouldn&#39;t have pointed it out in the first place.

With her intention of identifying the creature&#39;s origins, he withdrew his hand to cross his arms instead while she worked. His eyes had drifted from studying her to studying it instead, willing himself patient until her deduction drew his attention anew. His lips re-thinned at the naming of <em>construct,</em> with whatever suspicions he&#39;d had arising once more. The mention of seams wasn&#39;t really up Dr. Stein&#39;s alley from what he remembered, which only seemed to further pin the creature&#39;s origins elsewhere.

Curiosity was creeping, and mentally he damned himself for it even as he asked a rather pointed but odd question. &quot;Does it look like it could shift into another type of beastie at all? ...Like a puzzle, with extra pieces.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She began carefully poking and prodding at the writhing little body. &quot;I&#39;ll give it a look... I&#39;ve never encountered anything like that before,&quot; she added gently, the sentiment sounding... odd. Almost... a little defensive? There was <em>some</em> weird emotion tangled up subtly in the words. As she prodded around, she ultimately elaborated.

&quot;... I... kind of had something similar as a weird... passion project I was trying to sort out in my spare time, but I haven&#39;t actually encountered the concept seen to fruition. Kind of... thought I was the only one who did stuff like that. But I guess that&#39;s a rather self-centric way of thinking.&quot; She shrugged. 

&quot;I think whatever you&#39;re describing is probably more of a simple matter than the ridiculous stuff I was drafting up. And... real life kept getting in the way of progress,&quot; she added, the words a little softer. &quot;... I had been meaning to start messing with some of the bones I&#39;ve collected this summer, but...&quot; she drifted off, her gaze still down on her probing, before giving a short ghost of a laugh. &quot;I think literally everything went wrong that could have ever possibly went wrong in my life. So it&#39;s... on hold.&quot;

She huffed a sigh--though she had evidently started to forget how much Cha Cha hated her and her necromancy, for better or for worse--looking back up at him. &quot;I&#39;m... not seeing anything that looks like it shifts like you&#39;re describing. I can... I guess try to detect any magic attached to it? But unless you have any other reason you&#39;d want to keep it &#39;alive&#39;, I can... well. <em>Kill it</em> isn&#39;t the right term.

He had no idea what it was that&#39;d kept her project on hold, but quietly he was grateful for it. One less abomination to fill the world.

He blinked a moment as he realized she&#39;d asked a question, and snorted at the idea. &quot;No, I don&#39;t want anything to do with it. If ya think detecting magic on it&#39;ll help, do it, but otherwise, it needs to be destroyed.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Life is nothing but a <em>toy</em> to be played with, to be.. molded into whatever shape ya want it to be. The dead are just more material to work with, no matter who they are or who they were.&quot;

Finally he turned to glance back at her, brow furrowed with a mixture of guarded emotions. &quot;You&#39;re not like him, but I used to think he was nice too. I s&#39;pose that means I&#39;m just waiting for the other shoe to drop.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He... wasn&#39;t <em>wrong</em>, but... he <em>was</em> wrong.

She digested that a moment. Tried to figure out how to quantify what he was missing. When she spoke again, her voice was small and unthreatening; still gripped with the anxiety of being hated, but also...

Maybe the events of the spring had stripped away some part of her that would have prevented her from making an attempt. Maybe she just got a little too close to real horror, and matters like this paled in comparison.

She drew in a deep breath, then, in streaks of golden light, something was raggedly ripped out of the little pseudo-stirge in her hand and drawn into her own body--and with that, it fell limp and motionless. That matter settled, she reached her free hand to draw her amulet out from beneath the neck of her dress, letting it rest atop her chest: a well-made golden ankh, with a little scarab in obsidian framed within its looped top.

&quot;My biological father is the god, Anubis. He is a funerary god, and a god of judgment. Where I&#39;m from... when we die, we are greeted by Him at a set of scales, where He weighs our hearts against a symbol of truth. If our hearts weigh heavier than that symbol--a feather--our souls are swallowed by a monster waiting at His side, and we cease to exist. If our hearts weigh lighter, we are welcomed into an eternal paradise. Anubis is not a god of the <em>act</em> of dying. Anubis is not even truly a god of <em>death</em>. He is a god of transitions, of facilitating the natural cycle between life, death and life again. His symbol bears the image of a scarab; a beetle who feeds on decay. As one thing dies, the scarab repurposes it into new life. One plant wilts and crumbles, and is turned into fertilizer, to nurture the newest sprouts just beginning to grow. Lifeforce is not a stagnant thing. It is flowing all around us all the time. That shelf you&#39;re fixing is the dead body of what was once a living entity. The leather you wear is the skin of a dead animal. The food you eat all once drew breath in some way or another, but now it nourishes your life instead. There is nothing <em>more</em> natural than necromancy, because to manipulate lifeforce is to join in tandem with that ebb and flow.&quot;

She turned the now inanimate body in her hands around, distractedly looking it over as she spoke, her words gentle and steady. &quot;Everything can be abused in the wrong hands, though. Every day, people manipulate aether so that they can charm others. Thinking, free-willed creatures, whose consent is overridden so that they heed the caster&#39;s will instead. You&#39;re standing here fixing a shelf, but countless woodworkers have used that same craft to make trebuchets or ballistae that go on to wreak devastation and death upon living people, sometimes even innocents. It&#39;s... easy to see things in black and white. I think we&#39;re predisposed to <em>want</em> things to be black and white. But nothing is. For better or for worse, there&#39;s nuance to everything.&quot; She was quiet a moment.

&quot;... I would have been successfully <em>murdered</em>, with my soul cursed to end up as a lemure in hell for all eternity, leaving behind more people than I could have predicted who were... were destroyed by what they thought happened to me. If it wasn&#39;t for my life being saved at the last possible instant by a necromantic safeguard.&quot; She gave a weak gesture with the pseudo-stirge. &quot;I&#39;ve never animated a humanoid, and I don&#39;t intend to. I&#39;ve never killed anything for the purpose of using the bodily materials it&#39;s left behind; I scavenge everything. I don&#39;t rob graves; I just walk through the woods. It goes against everything I believe in to manipulate a soul; even when I reanimate things, the natural cycle is never disturbed. I lend my own lifeforce to minions. I lend my own lifeforce to heal the wounds of others. Is <em>all</em> of it bad? Is there room for nuance, or should I have left you bleeding?&quot;

The words weren&#39;t combative, just plainly-put, still muted and soft.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At least he remained quiet while she explained herself, that heavy brow still lowered into a furrow that was half judgement and half contemplation. His gaze drifted to the amulet as it was pulled free, then to the subtle shifting of sand in a halo behind her head. Despite her looks, she <em>was</em> an aasimar, wasn&#39;t she? A direct descendent of a god, even, were her words to be explained. A god of Death, or the nature of things regarding death, but a god nevertheless. It was a weird little contradiction that settled back into the discomfort of Cha Cha&#39;s learned history with the subject and what her gentle retort suggested it could be. He was certainly no stranger to the concept of death feeding life, that part of her words earning the smallest of nods in understanding. Yet to use the same breath to state Necromancy followed the same rules once again re-broke what he had known  the craft to be.

His brow furrowed deeper as she continued to describe just <em>what</em> had kept her from the public so much this past season, a lump lodging in his throat. The idea that she <em>had</em> died and come back thanks to necromancy raised that same flag of alarm in his mind as the concept always did. He&#39;d have half a mind to ask if she only thought positively of the subject if he didn&#39;t already know her to have practiced it beforehand.

He wasn&#39;t sure if he could bring himself to believe her assurances on her boundaries with the craft. He&#39;d heard this song and dance before until the inevitable &quot;well actually&quot;&#39;s came out. There always was a grey zone, he knew, but he&#39;d also seen it used to justify some uncomfortable things as well.

Clearing his throat, he looked away again, jaw still set. &quot;... not that I ain&#39;t grateful ya stopped the bleeding, or did good work on that guild mission keeping us alive, but... I just wish it came from a different means.&quot;

He sighed, dragging a hand down his face tiredly. &quot;Ya say ya don&#39;t disturb the natural cycle, but I still can&#39;t quite believe that <em>necromancy</em> works as part of it. The things ya take to make <em>things,</em>&quot; He said, glancing to Gummy at that, &quot;They don&#39;t make it back into the cycle. They&#39;re removed from it.&quot;

&quot;What would ya do if your dearest friend or lover died? Would ya keep to your morals here, or would ya make an excuse to bring them back anyways? Because I&#39;ve seen that line crossed for the sake of the living against the dead&#39;s wishes, no matter how many times he assured her he wouldn&#39;t. Everyone&#39;s got a breaking point. Better to wash yer hands free of the means to enact it, lest ya be tempted to it.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Despite her demeanor being very nonthreatening and noncombative, Gummy was mean-mugging the shit out of Cha Cha. Or maybe that was just his face.

Skena exhaled a soft huff of--amusement? But the look on her face was a sad one.

&quot;I got into minion-craft over a decade ago,&quot; she murmured, answering his question with an anecdote. &quot;I met Kaleva back in Cautica. He lived with me at the temple for a year. It was the best year of my life at the time. I think we loved each other the moment we met. But he was a tiefling.&quot; She looked back up to Cha Cha&#39;s face at that, her own eyes tired. &quot;From what I&#39;ve gathered of the company you keep, I think you know where the story&#39;s going,&quot; she added softly. &quot;No one quite <em>liked</em> him there--except me--but it was a different kind of offense to have him so deeply interwoven with the Daughter of Divinity. The temple&#39;s crown jewel, the blood of the deity Himself. Best friends with a tiefling?&quot; She gave a little, listless shrug.

&quot;... The man who had raised me as my father arranged to have Kaleva framed for murder. In Cautica, the judicial system is called a Trial of Faith. The city provides arbiters, gladiators trained in combat from the time they were old enough to stand on their own. If you can survive against them, it&#39;s the gods&#39; will proving your innocence. Turns out, everyone just happened to be guilty.&quot;

She dropped her gaze again, setting the pseudo-stirge on the ground beside her to free up her hands to more comfortably settle around Gummy&#39;s wrinkly little velvet-suede-like body. &quot;... They wanted divine intervention, and I gave it to them. I almost managed to kill the arbiter before we were separated, when that same father-figure realized I had slipped away and thrown myself into the line of fire. I didn&#39;t know it was his doing at the time. But his crown jewel was burning herself alive in holy fire, so he negotiated Kaleva&#39;s sentence down to exile instead of the trial so it would deescalate. I didn&#39;t see Kaleva for another ten years. I had just bought him his very own first puppy that same day, and he wasn&#39;t even able to take her with him. So she stayed with me. And then she grew up. And then she grew old. And then I laid in bed with her as she died. And I stayed in bed until long after she had gone cold. And I... I felt so lonely, I wanted to go cold with her, too.&quot; The words had shriveled and become smaller, quieter. Painful.

&quot;I mummified her. I suppose you would argue that&#39;s not letting her body return to nature, either, but it&#39;s cultural, and... it&#39;s reverent. It felt like the right thing to do to the last piece of my heart. The head priest, my father figure, managed to pressure me into doing certain rituals I had been resistant to partake in. I had no tenacity left, so I just caved. People in uniquely debilitating afflictions--I was the one who had to euthanize them. Something about the comfort of it coming from the hands of an aasimar of Anubis. Not my comfort, though. I... I didn&#39;t see any future for myself.&quot;

She swallowed, keeping her voice as measured and even as she could. &quot;... I was desperately lonely. At a point, I made friends with a wild rat I found living in the garden. It... It was something.&quot; A beat. &quot;Rats don&#39;t live very long. When Muffin died, I... I was just... I was <em>so tired of everyone I loved leaving me</em>. I wasn&#39;t ready to say goodbye. So I... made things go a different direction. I learned how to preserve her. How to remake her. How to animate her.&quot;

Her lips twitched in a rather miserable and fleeting ghost of a smile. &quot;... It would actually be less pathetic if I had dragged her soul back. But I didn&#39;t. I was so desperate and lonely and had... <em>nothing</em> to live for. And I learned how to puppet a carcass so I could pretend I still had a single friend.&quot; Her gaze tiredly slid back to Cha Cha&#39;s face.

&quot;That <em>was</em> my breaking point. The line remained uncrossed.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Whether he took it to heart or not was likely a different story, but he wasn&#39;t screaming in her face or threatening her or anything like it. It wasn&#39;t like he could walk away as it was. Though his frown deepened as she spoke of Kaleva, his expression was one more of a sympathetic knowing. While the practices of Cautica were unfamiliar, the prejudice they experienced was not. Based on her description of their so called Trial of Faith, he wasn&#39;t sure if it was better or worse than Holbrook&#39;s tried and true methods... though he assumed Kaleva might have opinions, having experienced both sides of the coin. A pang of sympathy rang out in his heart, one that burned despite itself as she continued speaking about the puppy and the following years of solitude she&#39;d felt.

Moving on alone, despite the disappearance of those closest to you... that he could understand. In some distant way, the culmination of her experiences weren&#39;t too terribly different from his own, even if all the fiddly bits couldn&#39;t really have been farther from each other. He found it hard to protest she <em>hadn&#39;t</em> met a lowest of lows somehow... if it had just been the body of a rat, that was.. perhaps one of the less offensive uses of a body in the craft of necromancy.

He let out a sigh, not realizing he&#39;d been holding his breath. &quot;... I&#39;m sorry ya both had to go through that.&quot; He said, and meant it. &quot;And I&#39;m glad ya didn&#39;t cross the line. I don&#39;t.. put much stock into the children of the divine being better&#39;n anyone else, I&#39;ve seen that bite too many arses of the undeserving for that to be my final judgement, but... ya definitely have a unique situation.&quot;

He sighed again, making a vague, tired gesture towards her. &quot;Clearly ya have the blessing of yer father... if he&#39;s a god of the order of death and life like ya say he is, who am I to say he&#39;s wrong?&quot; A pause. &quot;Doesn&#39;t mean I have to like it though.&quot;

With an uncomfortable shift in position, he looked away again. She had bore her heart, it was only fair he bore his. It wasn&#39;t like he kept the secret on purpose, either. It simply wasn&#39;t something he enjoyed talking about, and people were polite enough not to ask. &quot;My mother died when I was a teenager. Got sick one winter, never could quite recover. My father was a necromancer, but he used his shite for science and healing. He did everything he could to try and keep her alive, but by the end, she was tired too. We went over what she wanted for her funeral, how she wanted to be prepared. She wanted to be burned &#39;n have her urn buried in the south where she was from. Dad couldn&#39;t let go, so.. he brought her back, soul and all. All the creatures he&#39;d had in the house before were.. quirky, I guess. They&#39;d been fun up until then, promises of progress, or the pursuit of knowledge, whatever he called it. After it all, it just sort of ended up being.. a means to an end. A way to maintain the illusion of a happy home. She was still there when I left... I imagine she will be until he dies.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And she did. Silently, patiently, not interrupting. But it didn&#39;t take long before her face had twisted itself in quiet horror.

When he fell silent again, she let the silence sit a moment, before replying, &quot;That&#39;s <em>objectively</em> awful. I&#39;m <em>so</em> sorry you had to witness any part of that.&quot; She shook her head a little.

&quot;... I... I get to see my Father. In my dreams, sometimes. The feeling of <em>peace</em> is unlike anything I think it&#39;s even possible to experience here in this life. I&#39;m not afraid of death, because I know what&#39;s on the other side.&quot; She paused, the words curdling slightly on her tongue. Her brow furrowed, and after a hesitation... she rephrased. 

&quot;... <em>I&#39;m</em> not afraid of what awaits me.&quot; A pause. &quot;... I... I think.&quot; Well that was more raw of a wound than she expected it to be, with Cha Cha witnessing her discovering a symptom of her post-traumatic stress disorder in real time.

&quot;... I... If... If nothing... <em>intercepts</em> me again,&quot; she tried a third time, &quot;... Then I&#39;m... not afraid of where I&#39;m going. But I&#39;m... I&#39;m afraid of going too soon, and the pain that would leave behind me for the people still living. I... I had finally found Kaleva again, we built a life together we both were in love with, and...&quot; 

Oops oops oops oops. This was not the point she had been about to make. But it was still too fresh, too real, too recent. Too tangible still. Derailed, there was just a hollow, haunted look on her face as she stared at a spot on the floor.

&quot;... You know, I... don&#39;t think the mortal mind is equipped to deal with coming back from dying,&quot; she went on, the words barely a whisper. &quot;I don&#39;t even think I did technically die. The safeguard kicked in before my soul left. Which... Which is... <em>so</em> good... I... I think I was killed in... the only way that would have sent me to hell, irrevocably. The... The necromancy directed my soul into a waiting vessel instead of letting it pass on. I was returned home the next day, but I...&quot; 

It was almost like she was reassuring herself as she reiterated, &quot;I <em>didn&#39;t</em> die. O-Or maybe I did, I... I don&#39;t know. I wasn&#39;t brought <em>back</em>, because I didn&#39;t go that far, but I... I got to... bleed out on the ground with a sword through my heart. I knew what my manner of death meant for where I was headed. It&#39;s--It&#39;s incredible how many thoughts you can have in just a few seconds. How you think of everyone you&#39;re leaving behind, everything you regret. Everything you didn&#39;t manage to do. Everyone you&#39;re... <em>failing</em> by leaving them alone. How much crueler it is for Kaleva to have reunited with me at all if I was just going to...&quot;

She was barely whispering, barely muttering, not even looking like she remembered the other person present. Her words drifted off, eyes glistening with a layer of tears that had not yet fallen for a moment. Then she suddenly seemed to remember herself, blinking profusely and looking around, as if she had lost something. 

&quot;... What was I... That... I-I&#39;m sorry, that wasn&#39;t what I was... trying to say, I...&quot; A moment. She forcibly shut herself up, drawing in a deep breath that attempted to steady her thoughts. 

&quot;... I-I&#39;ve... I&#39;ve tasted a little bit of the peace of the afterlife when I visit with my Father. I would... I would never take anyone away from that if they had reached that place. I couldn&#39;t fathom that. If... If Kaleva died, I&#39;d... I&#39;d be <em>sick</em>, but I... I know he&#39;d wait for me there. I...&quot;

She was fighting tooth and nail to regain her train of thought. &quot;... Your mother. I&#39;m. I&#39;m so sorry. That&#39;s... That kind of abuse is the fault of the caster, not the medium.&quot; Her eloquence seemed to have crumbled slightly, but she still sounded earnest, at least.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She sounded genuine, and he&#39;d seen her enough to believe her heart was firmly on her sleeve.

He watched her slowly try to explain herself... then again, and again. His arms unbarred from across his chest to instead lean against the desk behind him, his heavy brow softening just slightly at the pain she described ringing uncomfortably familiar in his own heart, both as a pain he&#39;d been on the other side of, and heard all too well. The technicalities of her situation were unusual, and though he had questions he kept his tongue still to simply listen. It wasn&#39;t a pretty fate she described, and though he wanted to stay impartial at the very least, he couldn&#39;t stop the pang of sympathy for her and the horrors she narrowly avoided by chance. 

As she remembered herself he gave a soft shake of his head at her apologies. At least he wasn&#39;t going to judge her for <em>this.</em> Not today, not now. At least the pair agreed the Caster was the true fault, even if Cha Cha&#39;s dislike of the whole craft was still thoroughly tainted. He wasn&#39;t able to think of a <em>different</em> way of sparing her the fate of damnation to hell though.

After a moment, he wet the dryness from his throat. &quot;It&#39;s... good that ya didn&#39;t truly die like that then. That&#39;s a horrid fate. Ya don&#39;t deserve that.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve had to watch so many people die over the years. It&#39;s inevitable in my line of work. Some of em die to the fight, and others die by their own hands afterwards. Bringing em back... might&#39;ve made their lives easier. Mine, too. I don&#39;t doubt that some of em wouldn&#39;t have minded a second chance, but I sure as hell wouldn&#39;t want to make them suffer all over again just for me. Necromancy just always seemed so <em>selfish</em> to me.&quot;

He furrowed his brow a little, some of the wilder aspects of her story not quite laying out in his head. How could someone die but not <em>really</em> die? &quot;How.. <em>did</em> ya get brought back? Was it-&quot; Remembering himself, he cleared his throat and shook his head. &quot;Sorry.

&quot;That temple--I had grown up there my entire life. My mother gave me over to their custody when I was too young to even remember her. So I was that crown jewel of theirs from the very beginning.&quot; A beat. &quot;Someone in that realm wanted to ensure my safety to an incredible degree. So when I was still a baby, a sample of flesh was taken from me. I&#39;ve... later been told that my memory was modified so I wouldn&#39;t remember the procedure and be traumatized by it, and the wound was healed up so I wouldn&#39;t have scars or pain from it. That sample of my flesh was used in a ritual of... honestly, such high necromancy that I... didn&#39;t even know this was possible until... ah. Until everything happened this spring.&quot; She gave a little, meek shrug.

&quot;The ritual, in short, took the sample of my flesh and grew it over an extended period into a perfect replica of myself. No soul in it, but an otherwise perfect, empty vessel. As I grew up, the clone aged alongside me, perfectly matching me at every stage. When... When I accrued scars, the clone even adopted those, as well. A replica of everything physical.&quot;

She was quiet for a moment. &quot;... It was kept somewhere safe by the person who created it, and the same ritual that created it also spun an enchantment. A... sort of tether to me--the real me. If my soul was ever loosed from my original body, the enchantment would catch it and transfer it to the new vessel before it could pass on to an afterlife. When... When I... died...? I... I don&#39;t <em>know</em> if it counts as dying. I... I had the... <em>experience</em> of dying,&quot; she said slowly, the words quiet, &quot;but I... didn&#39;t complete that transition to the other side. I wasn&#39;t resurrected, my soul didn&#39;t go anywhere that it&#39;d have to be drawn back from. I... woke up in the vessel housing the clone.&quot; Another pause, her lips open as she started to continue, but the words were... heavy on her tongue.

&quot;... I... knew what the sword did. The one that killed me. I knew it sent its victims straight to hell and warped them into becoming a fiend irrevocably. There was... no other way for me to interpret my foreign surroundings but as hell. They <em>had</em> to be. It... didn&#39;t matter that it looked nice and cozy and unthreatening. I knew I was in hell.&quot; Silence again, as she swallowed, clearing the dryness in her <em>own</em> mouth, before dragging her thoughts back on track from the spiral she teetered on the edge of.

&quot;I think... it was a full day that passed, before the demiplane I was on was able to be reconnected with my home here in Fielbarry and allowed Kaleva to come get me. It... wasn&#39;t until I was able to calm down enough to commune with my god that I could even believe it was not, actually, hell. It just seemed... well, what better way to begin an eternity of torture than to trick you into thinking you&#39;re safe first?&quot;

The words were hallow. Maybe she wanted to give a little <em>what can you do</em> half-smile and shrug, but neither really made it to fruition.

She looked down at her hands, one lifting a fraction to spread out her fingers. &quot;... This is not the body I was born into. It feels the exact same. <em>I</em> am the exact same; my mind, my soul, my memories, my personality... all of it was cleanly transferred. Nothing was used or taken that wasn&#39;t already mine. If... If I had been able to understand it at the time the sample of flesh was taken from me, I would have consented to it.&quot; A beat. &quot;... It... didn&#39;t prevent Kaleva from finding me with a sword through my heart. Or killing the man responsible. It didn&#39;t prevent Atreyu from seeing Kaleva with my body, himself covered in blood, and thinking <em>he&#39;d</em> killed me, and running in fear from his favorite person.&quot; She swallowed again. 

&quot;... But not everything can be cleanly prevented. It... has to be good enough when something can at least fix what went wrong.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Just because someone else had used this process to snipe her soul from eternal damnation didn&#39;t mean she was guilty of it. ... Nor was <em>guilty</em> quite the right word in this context. Though she&#39;d been too young to truly be able to consent to such a thing, it did soothe some small part of his discomfort that she would have, looking back on it with her current hindsight. It certainly sounded useful, and incredibly high level.

He wondered if his father had tried anything like it. The thought sent another little shiver down his numb back. <em>That would be the kind of bullshit contingency he&#39;d have,</em> he realized with a frown.

Tuning back in after the brief lapse of wandering, he tried to... extend some sympathy. How would <em>he</em> have reacted in such a situation, had he thought he&#39;d died and been sent to hell? He would be pressed to say that he could&#39;ve done much else to assert truth on his reality. He didn&#39;t even have a deity he Trusted to reach out to in confirmation. Who knows how long he could have been suspended in a state of pre-hell before some other shoe dropped. Even if that ultimately hadn&#39;t been the case here.

He was quiet for a moment, ruminating on her words. &quot;.. No, it definitely doesn&#39;t undo the problems it caused. Sometimes the most effective thing ya can do afterwards is just... try to clean up.&quot; He sighed, eyes pinched as he thought to those many, many long years. Grief had gripped him in its vice, and he&#39;d had to swallow every tooth of it to help the remaining survivors instead.

&quot;Well... Ya got another chance, at least. Most people don&#39;t get that kinda responsibility. What&#39;re ya gonna do with it?&quot; He asked. He wasn&#39;t so bold as to call her <em>lucky</em> for it. The only thing she was lucky for was that her intended fate never played out. She was lucky it was <em>salvageable.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;... The person who wanted me dead is still out there,&quot; she murmured quietly. &quot;Kaleva... killed the man who had wielded the sword, but when it became apparent he had been acting under some sort of charm and did not actually have any intention of or will to kill me, he arranged to have Cassiana resurrect him.&quot;

She paused, looking up at Cha Cha with a slight tilt to her head. &quot;... You do know that... the soul has to be <em>willing</em> to return for that to work, right?&quot; She ventured gently. &quot;... Whatever happened to your mother... <em>that&#39;s</em> not resurrection. If she wanted to stay dead, your father wouldn&#39;t have been able to drag her back through the kind of magic I use. Or what Cassiana presumably uses, for that matter. I... I actually don&#39;t think I would even know <em>how</em> to go about dragging back an unwilling soul. It&#39;s... That&#39;s a special kind of corruption and... <em>mutation</em> from what the magic is made to do. That&#39;d be a disgusting bastardization of necromancy, whatever it was he did. That&#39;s not how it&#39;s supposed to be used, that&#39;s not how it&#39;s supposed to work. The... The <em>normal</em> ritual involves reaching out to where that soul has gone, and those present for the ritual then must try to convince the soul to return.&quot; She huffed a wry breath. 

&quot;... Even if everything goes right, the soul can decline, and the magic fails. Even if the soul <em>agrees</em>, the magic can still fail. It&#39;s precarious and not a guarantee even under the best circumstances. But if that soul has found an afterlife it wishes to stay in, there is nothing--<em>nothing</em>--the caster can do to overrule that.&quot; She let that sink in a moment, before emphasizing, &quot;I have <em>no</em> idea what your father did. But he&#39;s evil for it. And I&#39;m so sorry you were exposed to that.

In resurrection, no less. She definitely was a far different person from the woman he&#39;d originally befriended. He didn&#39;t want to consider the alternative train of thought that splintered off from that, so he didn&#39;t. His expression shifted as Skena continued to explain, brow furrowing searchingly at her expression as she spoke. He could find no trace of an attempt to lie or mislead him. But then, he was expecting that less and less, especially with her own expressed discomfort towards his story.

So the soul <em>should</em> be able to decline after all. It gave him some measure of peace, knowing that now. Remembering his mother&#39;s opinion didn&#39;t make that any easier of a pill to swallow. His gaze drifted to lifeless abomination Skena had pried from his back with a subtle squint. Looks like creatures weren&#39;t the only thing his father had had a hand in corrupting. Perhaps he shouldn&#39;t have been surprised that he&#39;d also bastardize a spell with built-in consent to do what he liked too.

&quot;I&#39;ve spent a lot of time wondering, but I can&#39;t say any amount of it sounds pleasant. Knowing she was <em>in</em> there, but couldn&#39;t so much as sneeze without his will...&quot; He shook his head, a lip curled in grimace. &quot;The only consolation I&#39;ve had is that he didn&#39;t try killing me &#39;n doing it to me.

He cleared his throat, silent for a moment. &quot;I don&#39;t... like knowing there&#39;s a killer out on the loose.

The words lodged uncomfortably in Cha Cha&#39;s throat for a moment, and he cleared it once, twice as he looked away. &quot;Well. Keep me posted then. I&#39;d like to give a shite like that a piece of my mind. Or my hammer.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her gaze wandered again, chewing over things. &quot;The tiefling with his horns cut off--his name is Ludin. He&#39;s Kaleva&#39;s biological father, who he met for the first time this spring.

&quot;Well, I&#39;ll be damned. So they sent the doormat out to do their dirty work instead of comin out themselves? I didn&#39;t like em before, but now I like em even less.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;... It&#39;s... just a question of why they&#39;d want me, specifically, dead. Kaleva and I weren&#39;t involved in that mission. But... we&#39;re... very confident that Kaleva&#39;s infernal heritage comes from Fenrir specifically. We&#39;re just... not really sure <em>how</em> that ties in. Only that it... almost certainly <em>does</em>, somewhere.&quot;

She looked down at Gummy, who--as Cha Cha&#39;s bitterness towards Skena directly had waned--was now comfortably loafing, eyes squinted almost entirely shut as Skena&#39;s hands idly massaged over his soft hide in self-soothing. &quot;... It would... make the most sense that they would desire to be allied with Kaleva in some capacity, given his ties to their deity. But Kaleva could never be swayed away from the life we&#39;ve created. The only thing I&#39;ve been able to think of is that... maybe I was what was in the way. Maybe... getting rid of me cut him loose from what was holding him back.&quot; She squinted, shaking her head again.

&quot;... But that doesn&#39;t make sense all the way either. He wouldn&#39;t <em>ally</em> with the people who killed me just because he no longer had me around as a reason to stay put. And... Ludin is his biological father, so <em>Ludin</em> had the same heritage. If they just deliberately sent him out with the intention of manipulating him into killing me, they must have known there was at least a <em>chance</em> that his life became forfeit. I don&#39;t understand what the transaction was.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Like them, he mostly came up empty with nothing more than speculation and frustration for the lack of knowing. &quot;With him not bein there fer the mission, they might not&#39;ve known enough <em>to</em> know if killin ya was enough to make him turn. I think it&#39;s a bit.. hh, pardon the phrase, but.. <em>overkill</em> to send someone like him out here with a weapon like that, if they were just guessing. Especially if he was under someone else&#39;s control like ya said. Feels like a few too many eggs in one basket fer that.&quot;

He frowned again. &quot;Or maybe they just <em>have</em> shite like that lying around and they can afford to just throw shite at the wall &#39;til somethin sticks. I mean, they <em>had</em> a pegasus. Nuala wasn&#39;t the only one they&#39;d taken too if I remember right.&quot;

&quot;Alternatively, this could&#39;ve just been to set an example. A Threat. Just to show what they <em>can</em> do before they reveal their real aims.

Ludin first approached us <em>as</em> Kaleva&#39;s father. Just... to extend apologies for not being in his life. A willingness to... try to start a relationship he knew he didn&#39;t deserve. You called him a doormat, so I take it you know what I mean when I... compassionately describe him as pathetic. Kaleva was a little shaken, but we took him up on it. Even went as far as to begin building him a place of his own, a mile or so away from our house. It lasted about a month, and...&quot;

Skena&#39;s brows furrowed again. It... wasn&#39;t really her place to disclose sensitive information regarding Kaleva&#39;s lycanthropy. Cha Cha <em>knew</em> he was a blood hunter, that had come out during the mission they had all gone on together. But to disclose how strange and... worrying things had gotten building up to the full moon...

&quot;... <em>Something</em> was going on, through a different avenue. I... shouldn&#39;t really elaborate much out of respect for Kaleva&#39;s privacy, but... it went beyond just Ludin socializing with us. It was almost like Fenrir himself became involved. We... got so worried over Kaleva being on the receiving end of that, we weren&#39;t really... thinking anything was going to be targeting <em>me</em>. I had nothing to do with Fenrir or Ludin, outside of affiliation with Kaleva.&quot; She swallowed. 

&quot;I... It happened on the night of the full moon. I&#39;d seen Ludin just a day or two prior, and he seemed... normal. Squirrely is normal for him, anyways. With everything that was feeling like it was building up in a very problematic way... I asked him if he knew something about what was going on. We suspected it had ties to that cult, and we knew he did too, but very little had been explicitly discussed. It felt like the slightest accusation was going to scare him off permanently, so we were trying to be gentle.&quot; She shrugged a little. &quot;... I didn&#39;t get the idea Ludin was in on whatever was working against us. He just seemed to... know just enough to assign some form of guilt upon himself, and he made himself scarce.&quot;

She forced herself to suck in a deep breath and fill her lungs. &quot;... Fenrir is a demon. I&#39;m confident of that at this point. Demons aren&#39;t devils. Both are fiends, but where devils are lawful and work through contracts and fine print, demons are chaotic. Devils want to conquer and dominate in a never-ending game of infernal politics, but demons just want to wreak destruction. Violence for the sake of violence. Blood for the sake of blood. If given their way, they&#39;d shake the entire world apart just to revel in it crumbling to nothingness. Devils are dangerous because they think so, so, so many steps ahead of what you or I would have the capacity to predict. Demons are dangerous because they defy predictions at all.&quot; She shook her head, looking up at him with the tired eyes of someone who had this topic buzzing around in her skull for the past three seasons.

&quot;If you figure out how to deduce the schemes of a cult who worships such an entity, I&#39;d appreciate that insight. But it&#39;s... maddening with how open-ended it feels. And I guess that&#39;s the point.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He nodded again as she admitted discretion of Kaleva&#39;s struggles, taking to heart the need for silence on his behalf. It wouldn&#39;t be the first secret he&#39;d keep for someone else. Though he himself hadn&#39;t experienced much difference in the moon&#39;s pull out of the usual tides it brought, that was no surprise, especially as she continued.

The fingers that had been stroking his beard stilled, a finger resting above his lips in contemplation over Fenrir&#39;s true identity. First devils, now demons. If demons truly were violent just for the sake of violent... &quot;There might not even be an end goal, aside from freeing him then. I can&#39;t think of any sort of <em>prophecy</em> or warning that would put sense into this. I&#39;ll keep an ear out for it though. It ain&#39;t helpful much, but most we can really do is settle the rest of our matters &#39;n keep ourselves sharp in the meantime.&quot;

He paused, letting out a small sound. &quot;Although, I can try sendin out some letters. I&#39;ve got a few friends up north of us still.

Better to rest up now &#39;n lean on yer support for a while since ya can. Ya can always take up the fight again after y&#39;ve gathered your strength.&quot;

He paused as she offered to help, brow furrowing just a smidge. He let her speak her peace, even if the mention of <em>good</em> necromancers drew that furrow a little deeper. It was hard to tell where exactly his mind was at while he ruminated on her words... but ultimately, it was the offering of <em>choice</em> that won out in the end.

&quot;... Ya haven&#39;t lied to me yet.&quot; He murmured, voice neutral as he sounded out his thoughts. Though the word <em>yet</em> could have easily been accusatory, it didn&#39;t hold that tone right now. &quot;I&#39;ll keep ya in mind.

&quot;It does. Freaks being welcomed is largely a good thing, I think,&quot; she offered with meek positivity, &quot;Otherwise Kaleva and I wouldn&#39;t have felt nearly as willing to settle down here. Despite the necromancy and ancestry and all that, <em>I&#39;m</em> not undead--but people have no idea what to think when they see me, usually. And just finding a place that didn&#39;t care about tieflings any more than any other demographic was enough of a selling point...&quot;

She drifted off, going back to probing at the strange construct. &quot;But usually the <em>freaks</em> here aren&#39;t the insidious variety. Like... I&#39;d be shocked if someone like your father was just integrated into the community, that seems too jarring. But... you know him and his craft better than I would, obviously. If this is enough to concern you that it&#39;s related, I can bring it home and do a necropsy--&quot; she paused, looking back up at Cha Cha.

&quot;Which is just the word for an autopsy on a creature instead of a humanoid, and is not a form of necromancy, by the way,&quot; she clarified. &quot;But I can scrutinize it a bit better with the tools and resources I have at home, and see if anything comes of that which yields any new insight? It&#39;s... Mm.&quot;

She grasped one of the bat-like wings between her fingers, pulling it to unfurl. &quot;... It&#39;s hard to figure out what this was doing just from that kind of dissection, but it might stir something interesting up. Don&#39;t suppose you have any idea why someone might theoretically want your blood? Assuming this was... a deliberate thing sent out like that.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

They might not have ever found Cass, if things were just different enough. As judging as the old bear tended to be, he couldn&#39;t deny there were places <em>he</em> was labeled freak.

He&#39;d really gotten that comfortable here, huh.

He cleared his throat a little as she paused to explain, head shaking just the slightest bit as he quietly admitted with some assurance &quot;I know what a necropsy is, that&#39;s fine. Do what ya think is best.&quot;

He hadn&#39;t forgotten <em>everything</em> his father had taught him. With the feeling that he was going to start seeing more hints of him soon, part of him wished he&#39;d remembered more. Including if there was any reason to seek him out specifically for a blood sample other than a relation by blood? &quot;Can&#39;t say I can think of anything.

&quot;And, of course, I can always just ask god for input. Less long-winded than a scientific answer, but usually more convincing.&quot; She gave the not-stirge an idle little wiggle of gesticulation as she spoke.

Looking back up, she added after a moment, &quot;... How does your back feel? I imagine if there was some sort of toxin released, I&#39;d have heard about it by now...?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He shook his head to clear the idea away, instead raising an arm to pad around on his back some where the construct had latched on. &quot;It felt completely numb earlier when the bastard was bleedin me.

Same as any other cleric. Those of us with enough practice for it can usually open up some forms of communication with our deities through specific kinds of rituals or meditation, albeit that communication is often limited.&quot;

She gave an single nod as he described the numbness. &quot;Mosquitos do, yes. Vampire bats as well. It&#39;s extremely common, actually, for things that drink blood to naturally numb the area as part of the process, because it makes it much easier for them to feed if their victim isn&#39;t motivated to shake them off. Or even knows they&#39;re present at all. Even a species of ground finch on a tropical island that I&#39;ve heard of has a similar arrangement, though I don&#39;t think it technically <em>numbs</em> the area--but it&#39;s the only bird whose diet consists largely of the blood of other, larger birds, and the birds it feeds on don&#39;t seem to mind it pecking little holes open in their bodies. People think that&#39;s because the behavior originally had to do with the finches eating parasites off the larger birds, so they don&#39;t--&quot;

She paused, realizing she was babbling. Her features darkened with that ugly bruise-blush again, her lips pressing together a moment, before she cleared her throat. 

&quot;... Yeah, um. My magic should have helped sterilize things, but if you get itchy or sore when the numbness wears off, Cass can probably help you out. Otherwise--she and Nils have been to our home, and can tell you where to find it, and I can give it a look.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

While it <em>hadn&#39;t</em> actually been the part of her being a direct child of a divine that he&#39;d been confused about, he decided it was safer to let her talk than to correct her on which part he&#39;d decided he didn&#39;t want to know more about. That polite nodding slowed down the longer she spoke about the nature of blood-drinking creatures, finding the concept far less interesting than she did.

He wasn&#39;t going to lie and say he was sad she stopped, but he was at least going to be polite about it, especially as she swerved the conversation back to something more actionable than mere information. &quot;Aye, it should be fine. Hopefully it won&#39;t come to that.&quot;

He paused, lips pressing thin for a moment in front of a little sound. &quot;I mean.. that it heals easy. <em>Y&#39;know what I mean...&quot;</em> he said, trailing off. His arms folded for a moment in uncomfortable silence as he glanced to the door -still shut - and tapped his fingers against his arm.

&quot;Although. If ya.. want to give it a look now, I.. guess that wouldn&#39;t hurt. Just in case.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He turned around until his back faced her, reaching over his head to grab the back of his shirt and draw it up until his back was exposed to reveal a plethora of scars and tattoos. On the left shoulder blade he proudly bore the emblem of the Flamekeepers, though whether she recognized it or not wasn&#39;t something he considered at the moment. Remembering their difference in height he crouched down on a knee and glanced over his shoulder. &quot;... This alright?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;That&#39;s just fine, thank you,&quot; she replied politely, looking over the wound. It was small, fortunately, and didn&#39;t look immediately inflamed or anything similarly concerning, and her prior magic had sealed the open flesh back together. 

&quot;Sorry if my hands are cold,&quot; she murmured, &quot;I don&#39;t... have a lot of body heat.&quot; Her touch was a little on the cooler side, but it was soft and gentle as she placed explorative fingers on either side of the now-sealed puncture wound, little shimmers of golden light rippling about as she probed both with her magic and her bodily senses to try to ascertain what damage existed that she couldn&#39;t see. After a few brief moments of this, she murmured a soft word in celestial--and then, after a beat, another. Then she withdrew.

&quot;... Well, nothing looks more concerning than I would have expected. I sealed it up nicely, so unless you find a way to... rather impressively tear open the new skin holding it together, it shouldn&#39;t start bleeding on you again. Though you might get some bruising, soreness, stiffness--but that&#39;ll likely go away like any bruise in a couple days. Nothing looks overtly infected or poisoned, there weren&#39;t any foreign bodies left in the wound or around it, I didn&#39;t get a sense any sort of foreign fluid had been injected, either. But I went ahead and cleansed any diseases or curses just in case. It&#39;d be a little helpful if that kind of magic let me know whether anything actually <em>was</em> cleansed away by the casting, but it doesn&#39;t; regardless, if this thing brought any nastiness with it like that, it&#39;ll be gone now.&quot;

She squinted at his back thoughtfully. &quot;I would <em>expect</em> the numbness to go away soon, though... not knowing anything about the kind of numbing element used, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d be expecting that to subside in minutes, hours, or days. But it&#39;s likely not problematic in any case--as long as the numbness doesn&#39;t start to <em>spread</em>. That&#39;s when I&#39;d recommend seeking out Cass for a more immediate look, I think.&quot; She shrugged a little. &quot;I really don&#39;t anticipate anything like that happening, though. All that to say: I think you&#39;re probably good for now.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Though he was able to reason and converse with Skena far more comfortably now that they’d had an.. admittedly forced moment given the circumstances, the hairless kleptomaniac of a minion had enough of a mind of its own that it still skeeved him out.

Skena was a person, and thus could be reasoned with. Gummy was chaos.

Despite inviting her to look at the wound, Cha Cha still seemed a bit wound tight with some hesitation and almost.. expectancy of something to happen. Especially considering that the wound had been numbed, just about anything could happen. Her warning on cold hands went appreciated at least, earning an affirmative grunt before he realized he <em>could</em> feel the gentle prodding of cold fingers after all, if only just a little. With the numbness beginning to fade, he relaxed just a bit more, even if he more than occasionally glanced over his shoulder towards Skena, both out of his usual paranoia and anticipation for any bad news. The soft murmurs in celestial didn’t help either, with his unfamiliarity with the language.

Bad news that thankfully didn’t come. Her report was fairly positive and reason was given for the murmurs behind him, a thoughtful spell cast he hadn’t expected but appreciated nevertheless. He waited for her to finish before standing back up again and tugging his shirt back on good as new. “Mn. Considering I could feel yer fingers a little bit there, the numbness might be fading pretty soon. I’ll keep an eye on it though, ‘n definitely get Cass if anything else happens.”

He paused, heavy brow settling on her with mixed emotions behind a more professional mask. Eventually, he cleared his throat to swallow his pride. “Thank ya. For checking.. and for grabbin that thing off my back. I’ve been nothin but… mn. Well, I guess ya know why now, at least.

But this mystery gave her pause for only a short moment, before she looked like she just stopped caring entirely, stooping to pick up Gummy. Not much of a mystery, really.

She folded the minion in her arms, cradled on his back like a wrinkly sack of potatoes. &quot;... I get it, honestly. People fear what they don&#39;t understand at the best of times. If that thing also <em>looks</em> scary, that just makes it worse. If the person <em>has</em> had objectively negative experiences with it on top of <em>that</em>, it&#39;d be nearly impossible for them to not paint the whole thing in a broad stroke. That&#39;s just the nature of how our minds work.&quot; Her shoulder gave a little shrug. 

&quot;I&#39;m self-aware of how my interests and occupations look. I don&#39;t want to make anyone uncomfortable, so I just try to keep it to myself wherever possible. Which sometimes feels like a losing battle, when I <em>look</em> like a corpse...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
