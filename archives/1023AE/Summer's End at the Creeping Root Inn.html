As the summer slowly yawned to a close with the gentle winds ushering in a change in the land around them, the first hints of leaves changing colors were enough to spark a sort of... opportunity in the young Anybody. For one, lessons had concluded for the time being as helping hands were needed for other things; the temple didn&#39;t have time to teach children when they could be put to work with simple tasks around town. Things to teach responsibility and humility. The harvest season was a perfect time to make a little extra coin to support the temple, <em>or</em> to save up for some very reasonable purchases.

Surely it was responsible of Anybody to save up and buy <em>himself</em> a sword, wasn&#39;t it? It&#39;s not like the Sisters were going to buy him one.

He poked his head into the tavern, peeping for anyone who looked like they could use someone else running errands for them. Instinctively he brushed his hair back to tuck it behind an ear, though it was just short enough that his bowl cut ended up falling along the brow line once again. He wore his usual alcolyte robes, blue hand-me-downs that had been repaired and maintained to be used by as many wards as possible.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She’d finally selected a small cottage on the edge of Fielbarry. She didn’t have much to fill the space with, despite having been in town for a few months. Still, moving had taken much of the morning, and she was tired and hungry for lunch. Although the weather cooled compared to earlier that week, moving during the waning summer days had still been an exertion. Wrinkling her nose, Onyx decided on a quick shower before wandering to find lunch. She was too tired to cook, and hadn’t even fully cleaned her new dwelling. The home stood empty for some time prior, and many rooms had a thick layer of dust to prove it.

A quick rinse later had Onyx re-plaiting her damp brown hair into a thick, neat braid. Her short bangs dusted her forehead above her eyebrows, and she left them to air dry as she slipped into her clothes. Her garb was of decent quality, but clearly well-used. She dressed in muted greens and teals, finally pulling on a pair of calf-length boots made of a cognac leather rich in tone. As she exited, a large black crow the size her forearm took to the air, gliding from the eaves of her roof to land smoothly on her shoulder. Onyx reached up to stroke the bird; the silver of her prosthetic left arm glinted in the sunlight as she did. The bird accepted head scratches without any qualms that the fingers giving them were metal, rather than flesh. “Come along, friend,” Onyx whispered softly to the bird, who shifted to remain perched on her shoulder as Onyx strolled toward town.

Her footsteps padded quietly on her walk, the soft leather of her boots clearly meant to muffle and disguise footsteps. As she approached the Inn, Onyx watched a small boy paused on the landing to poke his head inside. As her footsteps brought her within hearing range, she gave a gentle smile. “See anything you like in there?” Onyx spoke softly, her tone full of warmth, not wanting to startle the boy if he hadn’t heard her approach.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Um, just looking, mostly. It doesn&#39;t look too busy right now if um, you&#39;re looking for a good spot.&quot;

He gave her a second glance, curiosity tilting his head. &quot;... Are you new here? Are you a traveler? O-or an adventurer? Are you with the guild?&quot;

His eyes seemed to light up at the possibility, his baby blues darting from the glinting metal of her arm, to the large bird on her shoulder. His jaw slacked a little as he looked up, blinking at her companion. &quot;Woah..&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The yuan-ti was normally decked out in little to nothing other than some golden jewelry and scarves, sashes, and open vests... But today he looked downright ordinary, as massive half-snake men go, dressed in a navy blue kurta with gold embroidery, and no additional jewelry other than the curls of wire and beads adorning his long dreadlocks. His scales, for this who had seen him around, looked... Particularly dull, with very little of the rainbow iridescence seen on the golden brown and cream scales. His eyes too, black sclera and just a thin ring of gold around the pupil, were clouded over, like he was going blind. Like a snake preparing to shed.

He slithered on by, his hand reaching out to card sharp nails lightly across Anybody&#39;s scalp in a friendly scritch as he approached the bar for a glass of wine.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

My name is Onyx.&quot; Her tone remained soft and friendly as she spoke. 

Onyx&#39;s eyes followed Anybody&#39;s gaze to the crow on her shoulder, before looking through the open door to the interior of the Inn. Onyx shrugged her shoulder lightly, murmuring &quot;You can keep watch from the outside,&quot; to the bird. The crow turned his head sideways, seemingly thinking, before he nipped at Onyx&#39;s hair and took flight with a mighty beat of wings. She watched the crow land in the shelter of a nearby tree before turning her gaze back to Anybody.

Before she could move through the open door, a strange sound caused her to turn and watch the large yuan-ti approach. Her eyebrows raised slightly, admiring the golden threads decorating his garb, noting with approval his kindness to the boy in front of her.

She moved into the Inn as well, turning to Anybody as she walked by. &quot;Thank you. And what is it that you are looking for?&quot; Onyx stopped inside, letting her eyes adjust to the interior lighting as she  contemplated where to sit.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The sound of Mahva&#39;s approach was familiar enough to Anybody, and he grinned again as he earned a friendly scritch on the yuan-ti&#39;s way in. &quot;Hello, Mister Mahva!&quot; He called with a polite wave. The dull scales and eyes earned a curious glance; he&#39;d have to make sure he was alright later, just to be safe.

Looks like holding the door open had been a good idea after all. He made sure both Mahva&#39;s tail and Onyx were both safely inside before he followed in after them, hands clasping behind his back. &quot;Well, I like to hear stories about some of the adventures the guild gets to go on sometimes, but <em>today</em> I was kind of hoping some farmers or something were here, looking for a few extra hands.&quot;

Onyx&#39;s eyes, which generally seemed tinged with an old sadness, were instead contemplative as she mentally made a list of potential tasks.

&quot;Well, I need to do a grocery run after I have lunch. Would you like to help with that? I can work on a list while I eat. You and your friend would be welcome to join me.&quot; Onyx smiled in the direction of the yuan-ti, giving a little wave.

&quot;If that doesn&#39;t suit, I have a spot of yard work to be done at my new lodgings. There are a few fruit trees in the yard that need to be pruned.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Onyx didn&#39;t look like she&#39;d be rude or anything, and with the invitation being extended to Mahva as well, he had a good feeling.

He nodded quickly to Onyx for both potential errands. &quot;Yes, of course! I know a lot of the farmers around town too, I-I can help make sure you get a good deal. And I&#39;m strong, I can do yard work!&quot;

In emphasis, he gave a little flex; though the intent was there, his robes did little to hide his skinny arms. Sure, if he ate a bit better, he could probably put on a little muscle as he got older. At least he did not want for enthusiasm.

He smiled between the pair as Mahva introduced himself, giving Onyx another smile. &quot;Mister Mahva is very nice. I run errands for him sometimes, and he teaches me stuff. He&#39;s very smart.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Or two figures, rather. For better or worse, these were also relatively new faces to the town, but they seemed quite comfortable already. 

The first of the two was a smaller humanoid, seemingly a halfling as far as build and height were concerned, but that was where the similarities ended. What might stand out first (apart from the large, multi-eyed bird perched on their head) was their back-swept, nut brown horns and pitch black eyes. Their skin, as well, would draw the eye with the green vine-like marks traced all across it. Their clothing, at least, was unadorned and simply dark green and grey leathers made to be comfortable while traveling and going about their business around town. The book hanging from their belt was also fairly plain at first glance, save for the silvery chain wrapped around it.

The second figure was, of course, the bird perched on the halfling&#39;s head. For all the world she seemed like a normal raven, but the multiple sets of red eyes were a clear indicator that not all was as it should be. What else stood out, currently, was that she proudly held a shiny gold coin in her beak, tapping it against one of the halfling&#39;s horns as if to urge them on towards the bar.

Following this direction, the two-legged one made their way over to the bar and waved at the patrons already present. &quot;Whatever mead y&#39;have on order, please and thank you. Beatrice has been naggin&#39; me all day for it,&quot; they drawled to whoever was manning the bar.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Anybody caught the soft creak of the door and chanced a look over his shoulder. His brows raised in curiosity, starting with the halfling&#39;s curious appearance and then raising to the multi-eyed bird.. the multi-eyed bird currently holding a coin. And apparently insisting on a drink.

He wondered if it still tasted like a normal bird. A flick of his forked tongue to taste the air, a light smack against his upper palate, and he settled back on his scaly coils once more. &quot;Unusual familiar you have.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Onyx took in the distinctive attire of the newcomer with a slightly raised brow, eyes lingering on the dangling book with undisguised curiosity.

As they finished speaking, Onyx huffed an amused little snort. &quot;I&#39;ve never heard of a bird drinking mead,&quot; she offered with a wry grin, assuming Beatrice to refer to the multi-eyed bird.

At the bird&#39;s fussing, Clicker grinned - thankfully out of eyesight of the bird - and reached up to give her head a quick pat. In a stage whisper they said, &quot;Don&#39;t tell her she&#39;s the familiar in the equation, she <em>hates</em> being reminded, though some days I reckon it&#39;s hard to tell which is which.&quot; With a quick glance up and another grin, they went on with a more conversational tone, &quot;She&#39;s a dear one, though her love for drinks like this will be the death of me, if I&#39;m honest with you.

Once the mead arrived, the bird hopped down from their perch and onto the counter, happily dunking her beak into the drink that she so rightfully earned through fully honest means.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Thursday, September 7, 2023 4:43 AM">(edited)</span></div><div class="chatlog__attachment chatlog__attachment--hidden" onclick=showSpoiler(event,this)><div class=chatlog__attachment-spoiler-caption>SPOILER</div><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1147641160798580859/1149308697609244703/SPOILER_Beatrice.jpg?ex=655f3aa2&amp;is=654cc5a2&amp;hm=8be0210a1f612791e112f939a1c0574942c5aac7605c15e92ddef8f09f81f99a&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1147641160798580859/1149308697609244703/SPOILER_Beatrice.jpg?ex=655f3aa2&amp;is=654cc5a2&amp;hm=8be0210a1f612791e112f939a1c0574942c5aac7605c15e92ddef8f09f81f99a&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: SPOILER_Beatrice.jpg (192.17 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

The world’s shittiest tiefling had been lurking in his own solitude over an empty plate and a cup of something… probably alcoholic. He was a bit small for a man, but densely muscled—and more notably than his build was the fact that he seemed to embody every stereotypical trait a tiefling could have if the viewer thought them nothing more than devilspawn. Brick-red skin was made rough and jagged with ridges and small spikes here and there, even patches of what looked like reptilian scales in some places. His horns looked to be made out of something strongly resembling half-cooled lava, sweeping back and then angling slightly up where they framed his mohawk of coarse black hair. His tail was tipped with a narrow diamond shape that looked razor thin at the edges, and his fingers were tipped in thick claws that looked a bit more monstrous than the average tiefling’s did. His eyes were like burning embers with the slitted pupils of a dragon at their centers, his face and ears decorated here and there in piercings bearing dark iron or brass jewelry, and he seemed to be a chronic sufferer of resting bitch face. That attention was currently pinned on Mahva, with no regard presently given for the other oddities that had walked in (yet, at least). 

“Did you just <em>smell</em>? The—The fuckin’ lizard thing?” He said with undisguised bitterness (though at what, hard to say) and no regard whatsoever for his language falling on the ears of a child.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1151063760895737906 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1151063760895737906><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, September 12, 2023 12:56 AM">12:56 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__attachment chatlog__attachment--hidden" onclick=showSpoiler(event,this)><div class=chatlog__attachment-spoiler-caption>SPOILER</div><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1147641160798580859/1151063760522448956/SPOILER_unknown.png?ex=655c62aa&amp;is=6549edaa&amp;hm=8e3c9db55034cd825c7588430a64fb9432c42a90c0260f736ab2dd253489387c&amp;"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1147641160798580859/1151063760522448956/SPOILER_unknown.png?ex=655c62aa&amp;is=6549edaa&amp;hm=8e3c9db55034cd825c7588430a64fb9432c42a90c0260f736ab2dd253489387c&amp;" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: SPOILER_unknown.png (1.2 MB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

To prove his point, Arseni stuck out his own tongue--not in a petty expression of spite, but in demonstration; it, too, was forked. Maybe not quite so narrowly built as Mahva&#39;s tongue, but otherwise rather similar in appearance.

&quot;To be fair, you <em>do</em> smell with your tongue. As your sense of smell affects your ability to taste, so does the same work in reverse. It&#39;s simply not as strong a sense as mine. Which makes sense as I am biologically closer to being a reptile than you are. You might as well compare the olfactory capabilities of a pug to a wolf.&quot;

Then again, the snake man was well familiar with Arseni at this point, just by virtue of both frequenting this bar. And he wouldn’t exactly be the first to have figured out some of Arseni’s nuance, or how best to interact with him.

He stared after him a second longer, looking mildly insulted that… there was no kindling in his words for his anger to conflagrate upon. Then the little halfling’s words sank in, and he turned his scowl towards that stranger.

Having someone find novelty in his personality was not exactly new either, but it was one thing when that came from a place of some breed of affection. He immediately found himself disliking how the halfling spoke of it—but it was hard to identify that distaste from the general tone of distaste saturating his features.

“It’s bullshit to have the anatomy without the fucking use—it’s not that fuckin’ deep,” he growled, turning back to take a swig of his drink.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Still, they were curious about Mahva&#39;s words and gave them a try. Mouth open, senses at the ready for whatever new world was about to be unlocked.

To Arseni, he added, &quot;There are other uses for a forked tongue that don&#39;t have to do with smell. Something of a more private nature, if you get my meaning. If you&#39;d be interested in tips, let me know when young ears are not present.&quot;

Being that age felt like a lifetime ago to him. But he didn’t look too far off from the age where Arseni had lost what little he ever had worth cherishing in his otherwise <em>miserable</em> life. This sweet little sugary cherub had no idea. And he never would. 

No one would ever look at <em>him</em> and decidedly presume him a criminal. 

Arseni leaned forward, a strange coldness to his demeanor where it usually sparked and flared with heat.

Half of it, anyways. He was still definitely like the other bullies.

He flinched back as Arseni had leaned in, almost instinctively shifting closer to the familiar protective height of Mahva. Big friend? Big friend.

&quot;Cute. Wisdom comes from experience, doesn&#39;t it? Poor fuckin&#39; kid clearly hasn&#39;t had any.

Because of course they would all unanimously rally to the little rat&#39;s defense. That kind of unfairness just perpetuated itself.

Valentine, perhaps... uncharacteristically? was not intervening. 

Usually she was quick to clean up the decorum of her bar, and was no stranger to (physically, even) throwing Arseni out. And it wasn&#39;t like she didn&#39;t hear what was being said. But she simply... carried on with her tasks behind the bar, keeping an ear on the tension without actually interacting.

It just... felt a little too familiar. Especially in light of some private discussions she&#39;d had in the past. She had very little compassion for the spitfire tiefling, but... at least in this moment, for her own heavily biased and uniquely strange reasons... she would not be contributing to the dogpile.

That wasn&#39;t very cool of him. He pulled away from Mahva a little, straightening himself up and setting his jaw with some attempt at regal definition. Surely, he could defend himself, he was 15 for crying out loud. He was practically an adult.

He frowned at Arseni, fingers fidgeting for a moment before he set them at his sides instead in little fists. &quot;I&#39;m not <em>trying</em> to boss anyone around, sir. I just said you should try to be nicer to people. If I say I&#39;m sorry, will that make you happy?&quot;

Though such a phrase was easily said in mocking tones, Anybody, for his part, seemed quite sincere.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

You&#39;re the only one who took that as an invitation to tell me what I <em>should</em> be <em>trying</em> to do. You don&#39;t fucking know me, I wasn&#39;t even fucking talking to you. Does it hurt your pretty little ears when I say big bad scary words? <em>Grow the fuck up.</em>&quot;

(It was funny, Val mused to herself as she listened. He was unusually eloquent today. Go figure.)

&quot;Do your whiny little apologies if it makes your little conscious feel nice and clean, but I&#39;ll be <em>happy</em> when you&#39;re no longer <em>talking at me</em>.&quot;

&quot;How has Nikotiemus been settling back in, dear? I am very belatedly realizing I failed to ever check in on that,&quot; Val finally spoke up--though the nature of her words and how severely off-topic they were left a blank, bewildered look on Arseni&#39;s face as if she&#39;d thrown a live animal at his head out of the blue.

&quot;... What.&quot;

&quot;From the...&quot; she waved a hand in a circular, ambiguous motion, &quot;little expedition you went off on. I suppose you&#39;ve been a bit sparse since then, so perhaps it&#39;s no surprise it didn&#39;t occur to me to ask sooner. I was told there were no notable injuries for you and yours, so I do hope Nikotiemus has been settling back in more comfortably. I&#39;m sure the whole affair was harrowing.&quot;

Arseni stared at her in a long, drawn out silence. A dial-up noise echoed distantly between his ears. His eyes narrowed slightly. &quot;... He&#39;s. Fuckin&#39; fine.&quot; Another long pause. &quot;Why the fuck do you care?&quot;

Val gave the most lackadaisical shrug in reply, as if none of the prior conversation&#39;s tension existed on her side of the bar. &quot;Nikotiemus is a good patron to my establishment. I have never had issues with him. I am both curious as to how things have been in that regard, as I am of the hope that all has been well, for his sake.&quot;

Arseni continued to just... stare. Like a shark flipped onto its back and temporarily rendered adrift and inanimate. &quot;... He&#39;s fine. Nothing&#39;s fucking <em>wrong</em> with him.&quot;

&quot;I did not presume anything was. I simply have not seen much of you two.&quot;

&quot;... You&#39;re fucking <em>blind</em>.&quot;

&quot;Mm. Yes, I expect that is a contributing factor.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
