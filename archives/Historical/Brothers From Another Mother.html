The fresh air earned a satisfied smile, and he ran off with all the excitement and curiosity he could. He&#39;d heard stories of people in the woods, and was determined to find them.

He wore well-made clothes of wool, loose enough to ensure the summer&#39;s heat wouldn&#39;t bother him, but warm enough to keep him comfortable should the weather turn. His shoulder-length hair was pulled back into a tiny ponytail tuft behind his head, away from his plump face to ensure his bright red eyes wouldn&#39;t miss anything.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

What would normally be such a domestic scene was only different in the characters, not often seen in Holbrook: The human woman the only typical visage, her thick blonde hair in a fishtail braid over her shoulder, beside her an older orcish woman, green-skinned with black hair coiled up into a bun, and a prominent underbite.

The three boys in the stream were also unusual, two of them half-orcs, one a gangly teenager and the other just barely pre-teen, both with browned skin and prominent tusked teeth and pointed ears, and the third child a blue-skinned tiefling with nubby horns and a shock of copper hair and glowing white eyes without visible pupils. They gamboled about in their swimming shorts, wrestling about in the water, the eldest child occasionally snagging up one of the smaller boys and tossing them bodily into the deeper stream.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Any suspicion he&#39;d had was chased away with further wonder, taking in the group&#39;s unfamiliar appearances with a burning curiosity that quickly drove him to abandon all semblance of hiding.

&quot;Heeyyy!&quot; He yelled with an excited wave, straightening up to jog through the underbrush as best as he could.

But first, what is your name, and your parents&#39; names? The river and forest can be dangerous, and if you get hurt, we need to know where to take you and who to ask for.&quot;

&quot;Hi ma&#39;ams. I&#39;m Ilyacha, and my parents are Fyodor and Sevi. We live in town nearby not far. I play in these woods a lot sometimes, so I&#39;m not afraid.&quot; He said, with the solemn confidence of a child who clearly had everything under control.

Politeness out of the way, the boys grabbed his attention and earned a grin in return. He jogged over to the water, skipping on one foot as he struggled to yank off his boot, then skipping on the other to do the same to that one. All the while he spoke up even as he bounced before finally making his way to join them in the stream. &quot;How are ya cousins if ya look nothing alike? <em>My</em> cousin kinda looks like me.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He&#39;d heard of tieflings and met a few, though the ones he knew looked nothing like Nils, and he looked between them with some confusion. At least the cousins bit made sense to him. &quot;Ya don&#39;t look anything like the tieflings <em>I</em> know. Jonsi&#39;s got gold skin and green eyes. Ya should meet him! He&#39;s cool, even if he&#39;s kind of a dweeb.&quot;

He stood in the water, sinking his toes into the soft mud below before crouching, looking for fish and bugs even as he looked back to the older boys. &quot;Ya can choose family like that?

&quot;My dad says that tieflings can come in all kinds of different colors. Only other tiefling I ever met is Marko, he&#39;s got red skin, white hair, and yellow eyes. And only half a tail! He&#39;s kinda grumpy though.&quot; Nils waded through the water, looking into the stream as he went. &quot;But both my mom and dad are human.

&quot;Biological,&quot; Baako corrected.

&quot;Bi-ogical,&quot; Nils said with a nod. &quot;I don&#39;t know what that means, except for now if she has babies they will look like me.

His morose didn&#39;t last long as Tau joined him, attention refocusing on the tiny glints in the water. He snatched out a hand into the water at one and came back empty.

Talk of tieflings regained his interest, head tilting a little as he thought about the ones he knew. He&#39;d seen red ones before, that tracked.&quot;Bi-ological.&quot; He echoed thoughtfully. &quot;My dad probably knows more about it. He knows everything. He said red tieflings are more common than other colors for some reason...&quot;

He looked back to Baako and Tau. &quot;Ya guys are orcs, right? I&#39;ve never met one before. Are ya gonna get super big&#39;n strong when ya grow up?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Is that a caribou? How long has it been here? Do ya think there&#39;s more bones?&quot; He asked, offering Nils a hand to help him up.

Isn&#39;t that cool?!&quot; Nils threw his arms around Ilya&#39;s neck in an excited hug, turning him and his bone to show off to the ladies on the shore.

Ndidi pounded a fist to her breastbone and raised it up with a grin. Margret blinked and smirked. &quot;Very impressive. I&#39;d say he&#39;s the manliest of all of you.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot; Baato squawked. &quot;Why?!&quot;

&quot;He has the most body hair.&quot;

Nils burst out laughing at that, as Baato stood there with his mouth agape.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A little aghast shriek from the shore drew his attention; a girl with long wavy hair pulled back in a wild ponytail pointed at him, though her expression wasn&#39;t one of fear as it was of someone finding a secret. She had a similar skin tone and chubby cheeks that Ilya did. &quot;Ilya! You&#39;re not allowed to shift in front of strangers! I&#39;m telling uncle Fyo!&quot; She yelled with a naughty laugh, turning to try and disappear into the bush.

Ilya let out a yelp, tossing the bone to the shore to splash after her. &quot;Miiiina, stop being a stinkin snitch! Stop her!&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Thursday, November 24, 2022 1:02 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Nils, however, was immediately following Ilya&#39;s lead and dashing off after her. &quot;Snitches get stitches!&quot; he hollered after her, having not the first clue who she was, but on board all the same.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Get <em>off</em> you&#39;re CRUSHING me with your FAT BODY!&quot; she yelled to no avail.

&quot;No! Promise ya ain&#39;t telling dad!&quot;

&quot;I promise nothing! I&#39;ll never surrender! Jonsi, <em>do</em> something!&quot;

A gold tiefling sheepishly peeked from the bushes, twiggy arms raised into little fists. He was younger than the rest of him, only the tiniest horns barely visible above his whorls of white hair, with large scratched glasses making his wide green eyes look even larger. &quot;Let&#39;er go, you- oh!&quot;

He paused as he spotted Nils, giving the boy time to do as he pleased.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The soaked blue tiefling landed on top of the bear-child, cackling, and did a double-take at the other tiefling before beckoning him over. &quot;Come on! Climb on!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Traitor! I&#39;m gonna curse you! I&#39;m putting slugs in your shoes! Mud in your pillow! NOWHERE IS SAFE!&quot;

She swung a fist, smacking Ilya square in the face, earning a loud &quot;ow!&quot; for her efforts.

<em>&quot;Fine!</em> I won&#39;t tell just LET ME UP, <em>GODS!&quot;</em>

Satisfied with the magic words, Ilya finally rolled off of her and shifted back to human in a singular motion. His expression was smug against her annoyed expression before shifting to curiosity. &quot;What&#39;re ya doin here anyways?&quot;

&quot;Looking for you,&quot; Jonsi said, crawling off to wring his little fists in his shirt sheepishly. &quot;We wanted to play kickball.&quot;

&quot;Ooh, okay. Nils, ya wanna join us? Ya cousins can come too.&quot; Ilya grinned at him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Like this was something to be proud of. He blinked at the others curiously. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m down! I gotta check with Mom first though, but as long as Baato&#39;s with us, it should be fine. What&#39;s kickball?&quot;

He started circling Jonsi curiously, taking in the sight of the other tiefling, poking at his little nubs of horns and reaching out to give his tail a little tug with his own, which was starting to grow hook-like spines in a row of three toward the end.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Whoever gets the most points wins. Ya gotta kick the ball, obviously. It&#39;s easy!&quot; He said excitedly.

Jonsi looked up in awe at Nils, his tail curling behind him before it was tugged. The tip of his tail had a little crescent shape, two soft prongs curled inward. From the position of his horn nubs, one could imagine they would grow into a similar shape as he got older. &quot;You&#39;re blue? Woah... You don&#39;t have pupils either!&quot; He said, his own green eyes similarly devoid of pupils.

Mina stood up from where she&#39;d been dogpiled, dexterous fingers threading her hair to pull out all the twigs and leaves from it. &quot;They can join us if they&#39;re any good. I don&#39;t play with losers.&quot; She sniffed.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He looked over at Mina and raised an eyebrow, then pointed to both of his eyes, then to hers. &quot;Only loser by the end of the day is gonna be <em>you,</em> squealer. Just you wait.

Mina&#39;s response was to stick her tongue out and raspberry at him, crossing her arms defiantly. &quot;You wish. I&#39;m gonna go get Onda and Jennifer, and they&#39;ll join my team and totally wipe you guys. Jonsi, you&#39;re on my time, okay?&quot;

Jonsi looked over with wide eyes, glancing back to Nils with some hesitation before nodding. &quot;Oh, yeah, okay.&quot; To Nils he smiled, sheepish. &quot;We can be on the same team next time, right?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
